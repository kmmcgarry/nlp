"About 2 1/2 years ago my father had a heart attack at work nobody preformed CPR on him and the left him lay their for 45mins there were a few guys from his work that arived at the hospital and told my sister that my father collapsed at 400pm and the 911 report said the call wasn't made till 445pm anyways my question is now the doctors said my father has moderate alzheimers all he does all day long is lay around the house he is living with my sister at first he pee'd the bed he doesn't do it anymore but he cant remember to take a shower you have to actually get upset with him and tell him to get in the shower or he cant have a cigarette yes i know he shouldn't be smoking but my father in the past before his heart attack was an alcoholic as well as a smoker and he was in very good shape when he first came out of the hospital he took off in my sisters car we think he was trying to go back to his house we had called the cops because it was starting to get dark the cops found my sisters truck but not my father about 1 hr later my boyfriend and i had found him thank god. The next day he kept taking off on my sister trying to get cigarettes so she told the doctor what he was doing and the doctor told her to let him smoke but to control his cigarettes he kept thinking he had to go to work he couldn't understand what was going on he doesn't remember my b-day or my other sisters he keeps thinking i have kids and i am married which i am not nor do i have kids,I was talking to him a few weeks ago and he keeps telling me that god is punishing him ,and he keeps saying that they come to him at night and talk to him.He has been latley not willing to do anything except for laying in bed all day long,i asked him what is bothering him and he tells me nothing he is just waiting for his time to come.he is 49years old do you think this is alzheimers disease?or something else?he is on i think like 5 medications and one is to treat alzheimers but it doesn't seem to be helping at all is their something else he can take to help?"
