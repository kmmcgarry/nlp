"by vargagirls, 9 minutes agoi hope someone will be able to help me. i'm 52 and go to a pain management/acupuncturist for treatment of sever pain due to two failed back surgeries. i also had a closed head injury and suffer from terrible headaches.    a couple of months ago my dr. added embeda to my pain management regiment. (already taking 8 - 10 percocet 10mg.) she started me on the low dose, next month raised it to 60mg, next month raised it to 80mg. each month i was taking 4 pills 2 am 2 pm. when i got the 80mg i misunderstood the directions and took 2 am and 2 pm instead of one. the additional 80mg. had no effect on me at all. I was not tired or felt different in any way my pain relief was the same as when i was taking 2 60mg. when i told the doctor of my mistake she    was shocked i did not feel tired or have any additional pain relief, she then shocked me when she said she thought i may be suffering from early onset of alzheimer's. she said there must be problems with the transmitters in my brain, a indication of early alzheimer's. i have read everything i can get my hands on but can't find the correlation she spoke of.    there are a couple of other symptoms i have. 7 mo. ago i was in intensive care for anaphylaxis shock, my organs shutting down. a couple of days i recovered and left with no diagnosis of why it happened. i also produce alot of breast milk. does anyone know where i should go from here? or have an idea on what these strange seemingly unrelated symptoms could be.i would be grateful for anyone's help. i'm afraid and do not have anyone to speak to. i do not want to frighten my family until i have a better understanding of what is happening to me.thank you kindly"
