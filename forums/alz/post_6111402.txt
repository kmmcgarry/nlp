"I'd like to know if    the pieces of cataract that fell into the vetreous gel of my eye, after my capsule was broken, will ever fade away or absorb, and if so, how long will it take? The surgery was done on August 3, 2010, and I have 2 big floaters swirling directly in the vision of my sight, along with 100 or so very small spects.    They don't seem to be getting smaller or dropping down out of sight. They are the same size they were after the surgery and the head doctor has confirmed that they are pieces of the cataract that were not removed. I have never had floaters and the opacity in my right eye was really not that bad. I had the surgery because of it's tremendous success rate (98%), thinking it would give me 20/20 vision, which would have been great because of the endeavors I have."
