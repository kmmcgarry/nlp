"Has anyone had any experiences with intravenous vancomyacin andmerrem and alzheimers?My father was treated for pneumonia with vancomyacin and merrem in the hospital andhad a dramatic improvement in his ability to verbally communicate. Hewas treated with it one day and the next day he started talking again.He spoke in a normal manner for several days after. The doctors were treating the pneumonia not the alzheimers. His communication abilities declined gradually there after. The doctors felt the increased talking ability was the result of treating the infection of pneumonia but was not a treatment for the alzheimers.By chance has anyone observed the coincidence of this effect with these meds and alzheimers?"
