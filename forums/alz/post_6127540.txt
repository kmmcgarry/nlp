"Hi everyone,I have a question, as I'm a little concerned. I was attacked in a parking lot from behind about 5 hours ago, and sustained a concussion from the incident. I have no lasting effects to my knowledge from the incident, other than obvious sensitivity to that area of my head in which it occurred. Sometimes the scar appears a bit sore as well.An MRI done in April of this year (it was just a routine follow up) showed brain scarring. My neurologist asked me if I ever had any major head injuries, and I explained to him what happened. He said it must have been one major blow to show up on an MRI, and he said there might have also been bleeding on the brain when it occurred. Everything is apparently fine now, and he stated it apparently happened to a part of the brain that doesn't involve talking, memory, etc.My question is this: am I going to be more prone to something like alzheimer's or something of that sort because of this? My dad is suffering from that right now, at an early age (67), but he's had numerous other health issues, including stroke, heart attack, etc. I'm a health nut, and in shape - but just worry about what this might cause. Otherwise, I guess you could say I'm lucky in that it wasn't even worse."
