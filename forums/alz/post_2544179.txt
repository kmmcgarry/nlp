"The doctor just started my Mom on Zyprexa 5 MG today, she has Alzheimers and is taking Tradazone and Buspirone . An hour after taking the Zyprexa she was confused and thought my nephew was her child.She is 80 and lives alone,My sister her main caregiver lives next door and takes care of her meds and food, We are afraid she will not sleep with this new med.and wander outside.any thoughts from anyone..Thanks"
