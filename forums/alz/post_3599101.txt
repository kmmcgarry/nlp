"I have Bipolar I Disorder.    I posted a question in my community (BP) about BP getting worse with age.    My delima is that my family has a history of both dementia and Alzheimer Disease on each side of my family.    With bipolar, I have been told, that left untreated, it can lead to dementia in patients.    Of course, now, I am being treated, and that's a very good thing.Do you know if Dementia and Alzheimer's is inherited?    Does anyone know of someone that had bipolar and it went into dementia?    I struggle with these questions and have gotten some really good responses in the BP community and know that kindling is a condition of untreated bipolar, but wanted a perspective from the Alzheimer community.ThanksRacheal"
