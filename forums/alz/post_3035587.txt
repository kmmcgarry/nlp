"Hey everyone, i havent posted here before, but i dont know where else to turn my grandfather practically raised me, my mother and i lived with him until i was 7, and i did on and off my whole life, anyways we have been astranged for years now... , anyhow he recently was hospitalized and is suffering from alzheimers like symptoms and has asked for me at the hospital, i had a nurse call me out of the blue and tell me my grandfather was in the hospital and wanted me to come visit, my family has refused to see him, i just dont know if i should go, he told the nurse that i would be turning 13 soon and he wanted to wish me happy birthday...ill be 28 in september..i dont know if i should go...my family says i shouldnt because we have not spoken in years....and he thinks im still 13....would it be best to go see him even though he may not recognize me...i guess im just scared that it will somehow make him worse off to know that im not a kid anymore, and i really dont want to have to deal with explaining why he doesnt even know that i am married with kids of my own now...please give me some advise!"
