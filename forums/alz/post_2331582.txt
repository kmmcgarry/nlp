"I have been caring for my 85 yr old grandfather since July, when he was released from a nursing home. He was fine in april (driving, playing golf, going out, etc..) he was diagnosed with a uti and since was put in a nursing home and was in and out of hosp till July.    He began to show improvement and the family decided to take care of him.    Within a few weeks of being home he was walking again on his own and able to take care of himself(for the most part).    He then had a seizure, from his Dilantin level being too low and while in the hosp they did an mri and said he had evidence of an old stroke but nothing recent.    He was released and very slowly began losing motor skills with his hands and legs.    Within the past few weeks he has become very confused, unable to walk without falling and doing small tasks, such as hanging up the phone or trying to pull his pants down to use the bathroom.    He has fallen alot and trying to eat is very hard for him.    He cant pick up the food and get his hand to his mouth.    Seeing this happen has been very upsetting and I cant find the right answer.    It sounds like a litlle bit of a stroke (even though the mri says no), alheimers and/or dementia.    i was hoping i could get another idea.    please help??"
