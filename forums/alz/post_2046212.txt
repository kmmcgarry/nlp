"They diagnosed my 87 year old grandma.    I called her two days after and she not only remember my name to voice butasked about my baby and wife by name.    She is old and forgetful at time yes; is not that what happens when you get old?    I live in a different region than her so things get to me last. Grandpa just died three months ago, could this just be grief of her loss and bad diagnosis?    Apparently she went for a walk the other day, she is not stable because of her loss of grandpa(65yrs together). Tell me more.jake"
