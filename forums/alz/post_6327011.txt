"I am truly frightened. This suddenly came on today!    My mother can not remember anything about today. She does not remember she voted, she does not remember what she ate today, nothing?? She doesn't remember she is going on a trip to see me? I am so scared. She has had this happen before, 2 years ago, but she was totally fine the next day. Her mother had Alzheimers, so we are all scared to death and need some answers. What is our next step?? I am soo scared because I already saw my grandmother go through Alzheimers and I am hoping my mother does not have the same. Please help me, ANYBODY? I can't stop crying......"
