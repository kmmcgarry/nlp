"My dad has alzheimers.    He was diagnosed about 3 yrs ago.    He has cirrhosis of liver, diabetic too.    He takes several meds daily plus vitamins.    His amonia(ammonia)level get high and he has to drink this stuff to make him have a bowel movement to get rid of the amonia(ammonia)our body has.    He takes it if he wants to and is suppose to 3 times a dy.    If he soesnt take it he is in a real stupor, slow and tired.    The alzheimers is getting to where he says he hates me and I am his daughter which has always done everything for him along with my mom.    Mom just had surgery and is in a cast and can only get around on a walker.    So she needs help as well.    I help both.    My dad argues anytime I say anything.    He has gotten in my face and called me a B***h and Wh**e and even tried to hit me.    I am scared he is going to hurt my mom but she says no he want.    I cant get her to understand I think it is time he goes into assisted livein or nursing home.    He is only 64 and so is mom.    I work 8-9 hrs a day then go by their house to see what I can do to help.    I dont mind at all.    My dad now wont even speak to me so I dont say anything either cause if I do he will just yell.    He has went 7 wks without a shower and then some days he will cook, water plants, act normal but then here we go again.    Any Advice would be helpful.    By the way my other sister takes up for my dad and she is a pill head so they get along good.    My brother hasnt been in town much lately due to work and he has gotten into screaming matches with dad.    Mom says she just cant put dad elsewhere but she needs peace."
