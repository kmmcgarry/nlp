"My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's about 4 years ago.    She was recently told that she is at the beginnings of stage 3 of Alzheimer's as well.    Recently she has been having blackouts and loss of time.    Her longest loss of time was 6 hours.    She did things during this time such as getting dressed, going to McDonald's to eat, then to a Christmas Lights show and then back home.    The last thing she remembered was getting her coat and gloves before she left the house.    She doesn't remember eating at McDonald's but she remembered some of the Christmas lights, and she doesn't remember going home and eating dinner.    The doctor's have ran all kind's of test and they think the blackouts have nothing to do with Parkinson's or Alzhiemer's.    They want to do an MRI but she can't have one done because of an implant she has in her side that has wires running up her spine into the base of her brain.    They say the implant will cause an overload of electrical surges that may or may not kill her.    Have you heard of anyone with these time losses or blackouts that have Parkinson's or Alzheimers and if so were they part of these diseases or were they diagnosed with something else?    We are at a loss and we are afraid that she may become a danger to herself if she has more of these."
