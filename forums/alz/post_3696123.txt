"Hi i am sorry never posted a question on a forum thing before so sorry if its not quite right.I am 25 years old and i have been suffering from some kind of time lapse, it happened for the first time quite a few months ago and i thought nothing of it but now it is happening more and more, and it only happens when i drive. it happended again today, i was driving down the road one minutue and then the next minute i was 5 - 10 mintutes further into my journey and i cant remeber driving down the other roads.for example on my way to work today. i was driving down the road by the local pub, next mintute i am breaking to go round a round about about 10 minutes from the pub. and in between this i have had to drive on an express way and go down quite a bendy road. its scary the fact that i cant remeber driving down those roads plus my 2 year old daughter is in the car with me so if anything was to happen i dont know what i would do. i dont seem to have these time lapses any other time they only seem to happend when i am driving. and i wouldnt say i was forgetfull or suffering from any other kind of memory loss either. am i just being paranoid ?, there is no history in my family for memory loss or anything like that.has anyone else had this before ?Many ThanksGemerton"
