"Hi I am a 21 year old female. I have a lot of trouble remembering things; for example I will be answering someone's question and forget halfway through answering it what the question was, or I will forget a conversation happened or an event. I often find myself spending a long time thinking of a simple word, i.e in the cat sat on the mat I could find myself unable to remember the word mat. My great grandma on my mum's side had Alzheimers as did my grandma and I am worried that I am getting it too as I have been told it can be more likely if there is a history of it in your family. Do you think I am showing signs of Alzheimers, and is there anything that I can do to lessen my chances of getting it?Thank you in advance,Tazinijif"
