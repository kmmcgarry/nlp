"Hello AllI have been having memory problems. Not sure what to think of them. My anxiety and depression are getting the best of me. Every time I start to get my life back something else throws me in a downward spiral. I spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about my future instead of living it. To keep it short. I found out that I have a problem with my cervical spine which is causing headaches and neck pain. This was getting me very depressedI started noticing that I was forgetting too many things. This of course made me think I had yet another problem.I started worrying about Alzheimer's. My wife gave me a list of twenty things to memorize in a minute and even though I can remember all twenty weeks later, I still dwell on the fact that I forget too many things. Things like what I went to the store for. Did I pay that bill. The dogs worm pill. To tell a coworker something important.I know that at 46 I am not going to be quite as sharp as I once was, but I feel like I am falling apart.Someone told me that if you can stand on one leg in the dark for ten seconds that it's a good sign. I don't know how that relates to AL but I can stand for a minute or so.People say that age affects memory. Which memory, I can remember lock combination's from elementary school. But forget what I went to the garage for.Should I see a Neurologist or a Psychiatrist?"
