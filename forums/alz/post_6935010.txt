"My wife was recently prescribed both Aricept and Namenda.    Does that mean she has Alzheimer's or do they prescribe those medicines for other kinds of dementia too?    She's not demented at all, however, and her memory continues to be good.    She is eighty years old and now and then she forgets a doctor's appointment, but since she has six doctors that might be expected.    I haven't had a one-on-one with her neurologist, though.    She has to sign a HIPAA waiver first."
