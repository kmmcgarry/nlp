"The doctors say my aunt has alzheimer, from one day to the next she got so bad, I think maybe she had a stroke or something,    She refuses to eat, she repeats the same word, over and over,like 100 times in a few minutes,    she doesn't talk and has to be on oxygen all the time, they say oxygen isn't getting to the brain.    I don't know, i never knew anyone with this disease.    Can anyone tell me if this is the norm for someone with Alz?    Does this mean she is going to die soon, since the doctors are saying we should \"keep her comfortable\"?    Any help would be appreciated.    Thank you"
