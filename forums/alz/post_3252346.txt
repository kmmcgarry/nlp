"I am writing to seek help for my mom who has been diagnosed with carotid atherosclerosis and cerebral infarction. She also experiences the symptoms of short-term memory loss (she cannot remember what she had for breakfast, she gets lost in the neighborhood), irritability, confusion, etc., doctors suspect that she may have vascular dementia or AD.My mom was taking Aricept (Eisai), Enteric-coated aspirin, a Chinese medicine that contains Statins, and Ginkgo biloba. But she found purple area on her body (probably Purpura), and the now has stopped taking all drugs except Aricept.My mom develops purpura after taking Aspirin and other drugs, does it mean that she cannot take any anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs, as potentially all of the blood thinners have the risk of causing bleeding? If so, what can she do to reduce blood clotting in the artery to prevent further strokes? She was taking Asprin 100 mg per day, together with Statins, Ginkgo biloba (also an anticoagulant). Could she reduce the dose of aspirin, instead of stopping taking it at all? Or can she take Aspirin but stop taking other anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs (like Ginkgo biloba) at the same time?Thanks! Your kind help will be greatly appreciated!Vickyp.s. My mom does not have high blood pressure, no heart disease, no high blood lipids. Her blood test shows that CHOL, TG, HDL, LDL are within normal range. R80 whole blood viscosity, ESR (20. 0 MM), and RBC (0. 45 L) are beyond normal range."
