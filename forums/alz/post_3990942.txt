"About 2 years ago my mother, now 80, was diagnosed with AD.    She takes Amenda (sp).    She was diagnosed by the family doc becasue she was continually making appointments for numbness in her leg.    He would treat her and give meds and she would come again and again for the same thing like she had never been.    He asked her if she was having trouble remembering and she said yes.    My dad takes care of her but he seems to minimize her symptoms.    he says \"well we have some very interesting conversations\".    She tells me the same stories over and over and sometimes will tell a story that happened to someone else as if it happened to her.    With that said she still drives, although not at night and not very often anymore.    Dad got her    GPS but she won't use it.    My brother lives out of state and he says there is nothing wrong with her and she is just getting older.    She worries about me and I need to call her at least twice a day or she gets anxious.    She also will not stay at family functions when it starts to get dark and even though she wants me to call her she almost always makes my dad do most of the talking.    She was over tonight and asked me about 8 times where my dog was (it was upstairs in my son's room).    Some days I am convinced she has it and it is a proper diagnosis and other days I think I am overreacting and it is OK and she is just having normal aging.    I can't get my dad to talk about it much other than he tells me he has to stay healthy because she needs him.    He just had 7 bypass surgery and I don't want him to do this alone.    I tell him we are are here to help.    Does she need more tests?    Is there a sure way to know?    Am I over worried?    My daughter-in-law's grandmother has it but she cannot go to the bathroom by herself and needs contant care.    That is what makes me think my mom is fine because she is not like that. Any help would be great."
