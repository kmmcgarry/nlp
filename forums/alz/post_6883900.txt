"so as i sit and look at my sweet mom and its getting close to mothers day, it makes me very sad, but happy that i still have her. i try everyday to make her life a little better . with a extra long hug or lets go out for breakefast, she does not do much anymore its taking over her body but just a small hug or smile or touch makes her day better.for mothers day am going to buy her a new gown, she stays in them a lot and loves pink so thats what i will get    her , and take her out for dinner.what are ya going to do for your loved one?i hope all the mothers on here havea stress free day and enjoy family. GOD BLESS YA ALL."
