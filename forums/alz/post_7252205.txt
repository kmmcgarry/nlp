"Hi people,My mums decline may have showed signs over the last three years since my dad died. Shes 72, but in this last month and a half she lost it. i see, that from now on she can no longer live on her own.    Hallucinations at first, now regulated with Risperidone, psychiatrist thinks its dementia. She keeps her upkeeing as much as possible but    unable to perform daily tasks. dressing, cooking, making coffee..cleaning, I help her in fact i do it. Im her only child. and im exhausted. she is very tired all the time low energy as she is a tiny person in size. i remind her about food. She takes antidepressant too which help. and vitamin B1, 12, 6.She bagun to wet the bed a few times. and is generally very low. She often says some pretty mad things. and when i say kichen she goes to the other direction. generally confused big time.i know i need to find home care. I take her to a day center three times a week now for Alz, where they do activities.I am wondering what stage of this are we in.    is it advanced, not, where am i? Can it happen so suddenly amd why? if so whats to follow. Does it level for a while or does it move at the same rate.could it be psudo dementia from deep depression. or am i being fooled.Thanks for hearing me and to anyone out there that either shares teh same or has the knoweledge about my questions.Thank you,"
