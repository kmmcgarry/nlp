"GoodMorning to All:    wanted to let everyone we are here to talk if you need to, as i have been threw this with my mom it is not easy and takes a lot out of their love ones, so if your caring for a love one who is going threw this please take the time to take care of yourself, eat,get rest and have your time away so that when they need you most you can be there .there was times i just could not go another min, but i did and i was so stressed at times, but than i look at my Moms sweet face and her smile and i knew why i was there and that i had to keep going on her Journey with her. I miss my mom so much and Blessed to have the last 7 years with her in my home. so when it gets hard and your ready to give up. try and remember that its not that persons fault thay are like they are its the Disease and if they could change it they would.love them all you can . GOD BLESS each of you .Barbara"
