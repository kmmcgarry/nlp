"Our mother started not urinating. She also was constipated.    After being hospitalized twice and getting the run around I finally got them to address the real problem ( urinary issues)    They got her in with a Urologist he told us that Mom's bladdar is basically dead and does not function like it should. It wont squeeze. Same with bowels. He said urine just sits there and collects because she is bedridden and just lays there.    The cathiter would make it come out for the most part. There is now sand/crystals or substance making blockages because of this backing up of urine.I just want to know if this is a common thing with Alzheimers patients.She has history of Type 2 diabetes as well.    Several TIA's and when the bladdar was so full and she was unable to do a BM or Pee she suffered another TIA last month.The Urologist thinks that the stroke caused this problem but it was starting before the TIA we know about. I want to know if this is a common problem for dementia people?P.s please dont feel I don't appreciate a response. It may take a while for me to get time to read and respond. Have alot going on w/her and still raising two young kids. In advance thanks to anyone willing to respond."
