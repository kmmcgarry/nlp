"My mom refuses to bath, wash her hands, change her clothes, let me do her laundry, or change her bed linens. She also has a progressing toenail fungus that she will not let me treat. She has an established pattern of excessive daytime sleeping, but not is having extended periods of wakefulness - to the extreme of almost 24 hours at a time. She has asked me what year it is, cannot manage her finances, still insists upon driving short distances, drinks more than a 2 liter of diet pepsi per day...no other liquids, smokes up to 2 packs of cigarettes daily, picks her skin constantly. She is on the normal protocol of meds for Alzheimer's and in addition has CHF and takes meds for that condition as well. My husband and I have moved in to care for her, but it seems she may need an assisted living facility. She has flatly denied the possiblity of ever doing that and we are concerned. The list of problems is actually longer than those I have listed, any advice?"
