"A study has found that spinal tap fluid exactly recognized those who would develop Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease 100% of the time.Researches in Belgium identified levels of three bio-markers connected with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs in the member√¢ Ä ôs spinal fluid and grouped the individuals as a result. The bio √¢ Ä úsignature√¢ Ä ù was exposed in 90% of Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs patients, 72% with cognitive impairment and 36% of those with no cognitive difficulties.Autopsies confirmed that 64 of 68 patients diagnosed as having Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs had the signature. The signature model also was 100% precise in forecasting which patients would progress to Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs. The report was detailed in the Aug. 10 version of the Archives of Neurology."
