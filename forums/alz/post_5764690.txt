"Three years ago I had an MRI scan for persistent headache.    No cause found but \"incidental\" finding was \"marked frontal lobe atrophy\".    I was sixty then.    Neurologist examined and assessed me and said I had absolutely no dementia symptoms and that I was functioning at a high level and better than a lot of others of my age.    Told me to go away and fortget it.    Recently had another MRI for twitchy arms and legs and result said \"cerebral atrophy\".    Don't know if this is the same but expressed differently.    Still no signs of dementia but don't feel quite as sharp and getting rather apathetic about things.    This could be because I am very anxious though.    Is it possible to have brain atrophy with no symptoms and not to develop any either.    I'm probably clutching at straws here because if a neurologist can't give me a prognosis I expect it's a wait and see job!    Grateful for any replies."
