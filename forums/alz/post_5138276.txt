"Hi All, this is the first time I've been to this forum.    I've been a member of the MS forum since 2007.    My husband, who is 55, today, was just diagnosed with Mild cognitive impairment.    I, of course, did the google search when I got home and I am really scared.My husband's mother had alzheimer's and he reminds me so much of how she acted 2 or 3 years before her formal diagnosis.The literature I read was from the Mayo Clinic, and it states that 50% of people diagnosed with this eventually progress to Alzheimer's within 5 years.Just wondered if anyone knew anything about this.Thanks,doni"
