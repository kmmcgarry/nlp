"i was talking to a friend of mine and suddenly i felt dizzy and lightheaded. Then a ringing in my ears that kept getting louder, as these three things kept getting stronger i started to see blue spots, losing my vision, and felt confusion. i ended the conversation with my buddy and stepped out side, i immidiatly started to sweat as well. but after couple of minutes of fresh air and some water. i felt much better. what might have caused this?"
