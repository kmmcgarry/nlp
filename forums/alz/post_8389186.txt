"i took care of my mom through her last years of alzeimers.    she could get a little agressive.    im small weigh about100.    the last time we went to the hospital we got a new doctor.    he put her on buspar.    this changed her and made her less violent.    it made it easier on both of us.    i loved her so much i still cry for her.    she was my mom first then my best friend.    wish i was still with her.    i will join her some day."
