"I'm a 28 year old male, i've had anxiety and ocd for 17 years. About 3 years ago i drank alot one night and in the morning my ability to articulate my thoughts was not good. I never recovered completely from that. For the last year i've been doing alot better and my brain has been working well. But 2 weeks ago i was smoking a cig and i felt out of breath my heart was pounding and i was very lightheaded. I felt very spaced out since this happened plus my memory and thinking ability has been diminshing. I went to the er 2 days ago and of course the doc dismised it for anxiety. Well my memory and problem solving skills are not going back to were they use to be. I'm afraid i had a stroke which caused brain damage, or could this be an early onset dementia. I hope someone could give me advice Thanks."
