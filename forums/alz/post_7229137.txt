"My mother who is 76 is in the end stage of alzheimers. She resides with my father who is her sole caregiver. My sister and I live 4 hours away in another state. My father has been telling us she is doing well and when we speak to her on the phone daily she seemed very confused but pretty good considering. My sister went home to visit two weeks ago and found that everything was not ok. Mom had not bathed nor taken her medicine for several days. She was refusing to do so. The house was covered in dust however no dirty dishes or clothes. My sister had my dad set an appt with a neuro (mom had been being treated by internist) who said she was in the end stage of the disease. I then rushed home and my sister left. My mom was in tears on the bed because my sister had cleaned the house. She was angry and crying and had not eaten. I calmed her down and fed her and she then collapsed, staring straight ahead, not blinking and drooling. She did not respond for about 5 minutes while we waited on the ambulance. At the hospital she had mri, cat scan, eeg, pet scan, xray, carotid artery scan, blood tests ect. The neuro said she had a seizure ( possible mini strokes) and to take keppra. She is on aricept. She was decent when I left her and a home health care nurse had come by to provide some assistance. My mom was upset and did not want them in the house. I calmed her or so I thought.    I left and returned home thinking all was calm when my sister called and said that dad had cancelled the nurse and could not get mom to go to her follow up appt with the neuro from being in the hopital for 24 hours. I am scared and do not know what to do.My father has always adored my mother and taken wonderful care of her. They have been married for 56 years and I do not know what is going on with him. If someone has been through this any insights or ideas on what I can do to help them would be appreciated. Again, I am heartbroken over my mother and very angry at my father. Please help."
