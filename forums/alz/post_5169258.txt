"My grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer Disease 6 years ago. He was strong and use to walk a few miles daily. Now, he is in a wheel chair for the past year. Of course he says off the wall stuff. For the past 2 months he has been sleeping in bed most of the day and peas in the closet. He doesn't eat as much as he should. He is weak and needs help getting from the wheel chair to the bed or bathroom. It's so sad to see him go down hill like this and anyone. Does anyone really know what causes this disease and a cure or something close to it to help or prevent the disease from happening?"
