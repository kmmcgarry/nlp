"i am 31 years old and living at home with my parents while in school. ive no job and felt this was the best avenue to go to get myself employed again. recently i have started at a school that my student loans have been pushed back. this is an ivy league school and the work that is necessary is crucial to my getting my loans reinstated. of which i plan on getting to acquire residency closer to my school. I get no sleep here as my father who has altzheimers constantly talks in his sleep and his voice resonates through the walls,he is always bitching and moaning about my being anywhere in the house thats not my bedroom,and i cannot take this. i got my grades back and i did horribly. and so i am now stuck here until i can get back my loans.which    at the rate of schoolwork i do,not being able to concentrate here at home i find myself begging and pleading with friends to let me stay so i can do work. and when i had my final paper due,i went a few towns away to go to a friends place thern had to deal with ehr screaming 4 year old! ,i got a B+ i needed an A to get loans back.what do i do so i dont end up failing out of my school?"
