"I√¢ Ä ôm ctually from the Auto immune community but felt compelled to write in the Back and neck community.    My Rheumatologist checked my Vitamin D levels and anything under 32 is considered dangerous.    Mine came back a 7.5. I was put on 50,000 iu√¢ Ä ôs of Vitamin D a day this is prescription only, they said it was so low that normal vitamins would not help.    I√¢ Ä ôm amazed that my back problems have gone away.    I always though it was just something that I would have to live with.    I√¢ Ä ôm writing to your community to ask people to have the test run, I was amazed to find out that its not just a test that is ran automatically. There are many reasons why you may loose your vitamin D levels.    I have not felt this good since I was in my 20√¢ Ä ôs and just wanted to let you all know They are finding that low vitamin d levels contribute to several diseases such as Alzheimers, Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson, Rheumatoid Arthritis.    I hope this helps others. I√¢ Ä ôm so amazed in the difference that I feel."
