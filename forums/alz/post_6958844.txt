"My 83 year old mother was \"sort of\" diagnosed with Alzheimer's.    Her regular GP told her she had it and gave her a daily med.    She has been on it for about 3 years and she certainly seems to me to have Alzheimer's.    She lives with my father and he has started being with her almost all the time.    I don't feel like he is very honest with me about what is going on.    He tells me they have \"interesting conversations\" and she cannot cook any more because she burns food on the stove and in the microwave.    He says he is doing all the cooking.    I take them out to lunch once a week and talk to my Mom everyday, sometimes several times a day, and we get together for family things a lot,    Sometimes when I talk to her she doesn't make sense and then sometimes she seems normal.    She has a knee problem and is prone to falling and walks with a shuffle.    Over the winter my son and his wife needed to borrow a car so my Dad offered to let them have my Mom's car saying he could drive her every where.    I was relieved because I don't think she should drive anyway.    She had been limiting herself in the last few years and will only go a few palces, like the grocery and to her hair appointments.    After not driving for about 6 months she got her car back.    I don't think she should be driving at all.    Dad thinks she needs to stay active and she should drive...I am so worried she will have an accident, get lost, or hurt someone.    I don't know what to do.    I personally think she needs to see a neurologist or someone who specializes in this and get a good official diagnosis.    I worry everyday she will get behind the wheel and something very bad will happen.    Can anyone help me???"
