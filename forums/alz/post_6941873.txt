"My grandmother is 86 and she has dementia. She has been getting angry and agitated and violent but not all day, just from as soon as then clock hits 3 pm. She wants to go back to her house even though she lives in her house, she pushes me and my mom. She hit me across the face because I blocked her way out. Because once she gets out we cant get her back in unless we lie and bribe her. She threatens to kill us and swears up and down that its not her house and we need to help her to get out. But as soon as the clock hits 8:30 maybe 9 pm. shes claim wants to go to bed and sometimes gets up and wants a cookie. But she knows that she is home. Her nurse said to me while I explained to her what was going on she said sounds like a case of sun downers syndrome. I have never heard of it, but when I looked it up it sounds just like it. She is on xanax to keep her claim and help her sleep but it doesn't take at all during 3pm to 9pm. Anyone know about sun downers? Her dr is coming next week and I don't know what I would tell him."
