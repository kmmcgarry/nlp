"My 71 year old mother is a whiz at cross-word puzzles, has an active social life but has been plagued with unjustified thoughts about her kids.    No matter what my brothers, sister and I do it isn't enough.    It definitely wasn't this way before.    She was a great mom and has always been active in her life, not depending on us kids for any kind of reinforcement.    For the past few years she has been so hard on judging my siblings and my Dad.    At one point she sounded so venomousness towards my Dad and brother that I was sick over it.    I sent her a long email suggesting reflection and counseling since she should be enjoying her successes in life.    She seemed to get it, but is back to the meanness that she failed as a mother because no    one calls her.    It is irrational!    My one brother's job requires him to travel internationally non-stop so when he is home, he needs to catch up with his wife and kids.    My other brother communicates through facebook and email all the time.    The other... well he's not so good, but is a great person.    My mother is very active, in Florida for the winter with my Dad, golfing and playing bridge.    These tirades of hers come so unexpectedly.    She seems to be festering over not being called on Sunday's.    It's more than that.    She seems to find fault with many things and there is no pleasing her.    I'm the oldest and am at a loss for how to help my other siblings.    I am only suggesting we placate Mom and contact my Dad privately.    He may be suffering with this as well.I guess my question is if this is a sign of alzheimer's since my Mom doesn't seem to have any other symptoms.    She does repeat herself alot on the phone, but I think that is usually at night after she has had a few glasses of wine.    We are all very aware of when we call her.Very worried."
