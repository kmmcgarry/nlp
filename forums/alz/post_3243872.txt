"Over the last 4 months my husband has been experiencing slurring of words, lack of balance, personality changes, and some difficulty in finding words but ONLY in the evenings. This can happen 4 or 5 nights a week. He is fine during the day but says he is tired all of the time.     An MRI only showed a chronic sinus infection & \"insult to tissue due to chornic high blood pressure,\" neither of which we knew he had.    Both his grandmother and great-grandmother had Alzheimers.    We are stumped as to what this can be."
