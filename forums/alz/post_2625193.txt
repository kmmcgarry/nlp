"My mom is 69 and has been a heavy drinker all of her adult life. She has now begun to forget things and lose things frequently. My father is worried that it may be alzheimers because this happens in the daytime when she hasn't had a drink yet. Alcoholism runs in her family. How can we determine if she's suffering from prolonged alcohol use or if she has alzheimers?"
