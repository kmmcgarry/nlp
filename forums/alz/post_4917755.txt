"My memory has started a big fade, so I am interested in any therapies. Especially frightening are the number of short term issues that occur daily. I am undiagnosed, but intend to see my doc soon.I have started reading about Okinawa Island where no one gets Alzheimers unless they adopt a lifestyle (or diet) that is not traditional to their island. That seems proof that there is more to their lifestyle preventing Alzheimers than can occur purely from just good genes. Specifically, I am looking for information to determine if there is any benefit for me in adopting their lifestyle and diet if the disease has started?"
