"Hi,    can anyone recommend a player that would be appropriate for my 80 yr old dad to be able to use? he just recently went to the nursing home for the first time and most likely will be staying and i would like to find something that he can use without difficulty. guess that goes without saying. he has brain damage from previous sport injuries as well as alzheimers.thanx"
