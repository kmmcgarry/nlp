"My mother is 80 years old; she experiences bouts of confusion and incorrect word association.    While she has not been diagnosed, I am under the assumption that this is sundowners or the onset of Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs.Recently her eye Doctor has recommended to plastic surgery to repair Ectropion.    My fear is the anesthesia will increase her confusion and sundowner symptoms.    Will being under anesthesia cause acceleration of the confusion?    Is the surgery worth the risk?"
