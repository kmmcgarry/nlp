"I just want to post some possible words of encouragement. I, too, experience some short term memory loss, but, I can almost always remember if I think about what I am trying to remember hard enough. A Lot of the symptoms, may not be related to Alzheimer's. I am a member of a Peri menopause/menopause group, and believe me, there are many many ladies there that have the symptoms (some very sever) but do not have the disease of alzheimer's. According to the research done there and the books they have recommended, being in the perimenopausal/menopausal state can definitely cause Alzheimer's like symptoms. As our hormones fluctuate, they cause different changes in our brains, and unfortunately, this is one of the main ones. This can even be true for some men, no, they do not have menopause, etc, but, they can have some hormonal dysfunctions.I guess what I am trying to say is, just because you have all these symptoms, and to be honest, who doesn't at some point due to stress, etc, it sure does not mean you have alzheimer's. For the women, I suggest a good, heart to heart with your gyn about this, he/she may put you on some estrogen, either natural or bio-identical. There are a lot of other helps as well.This article will explain what I am trying to say, it is rather long, but, well worth the read. I hope this helps.http://www.power-surge.com/educate/menopause_and_the_mind.htmIf you have any questions, please feel free to PM me, I may not always have an answer, but, I will do my best to help anyway I can.Hugs to allSusie"
