"I AM 56 AND FEEL LIKE I AM REALLY LOOSING MY MIND. I CAN'T REMEMBER MY KIDS NAMES GRANDKIDS ,& SOMETIMES EVEN MY HUSBANDS. I USE TO BE VERY GOOD IN MATH AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN DO SIMPLE ADDING AND SUBTRACTING. PEOPLE TELL ME ABOUT THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE TOGETHER AND I DON/T HAVE A CLUE WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. LATELY I'VE HAD SOME REALLY BAD HEADACHES AND HAVE HAD SOME BAD VERTIGO BUT IT ONLY LAST FOR A MINUTE OR SO. SOMEBODY HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!GRAMMY43"
