"I am 67 and am having cognative difficulties. My father died from the ravages of Altzheimers at 62 after being diagnosed in his late 50's.    My mother died from Altzheimers in her early 80s. My maternal Grandmother, and her sister both had senility issues in their late 60's. I am quite familiar with the advanced symptoms but think I have some early symptoms. I am retired and really have a hard time remembering what day it is. I have trouble remembering my schedule.    I moved four years ago and had a horrible time trying to remember where I put things. I am just having more trouble staying organized than I used to, and I have a lot less to organize. I feel fuzzy, like every thing is out of focus."
