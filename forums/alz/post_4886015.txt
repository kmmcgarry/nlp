"I understand the basics of Alzheimer's disease, but I am curious as to why it is typically found in older or elderly adults. I know that as we age our cells change and they can mutate or deteriorate. Since this can happen at any age, I am wondering why dementia disorders are less common in children and young adults. I mean, theorectically, a child could develop Alzheimer's disease, could they not?"
