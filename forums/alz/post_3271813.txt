"I'm a 33 year old male, and over the last few months I have been experiecing short and even a little long term memory loss, some confusion on getting common words mixed up or forgetting them, or calling my friends the wrong name sometimes and basically not feeling like myself. I'm not depressed though, I'm eating and exercising healthy and I am very social but I'm worried that I'm experiencing in early form of Alzheimer's. My Mother has been diagnosed with Dementia in the past year as well. Any advice?"
