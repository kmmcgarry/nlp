"Hi,My father has had mild dementia for years. Over the past year and a half, however, it seems to be progressing quickly. My mother is having a tough time coping and understanding what comes next and how to deal with his outbursts, mood swings.. etc. He has an intolerance to most medicines that are out there and cannot take them. My question is do you know of any good online resources with information what will help prepare her for what is to come? I am in healthcare, and I have tried explaining it to her but it's hard for her to take advice from her \"baby girl\". Maybe a website aimed at spouses or caretakers? I have not come up with much in my own searches.    Thank you for any input you have!"
