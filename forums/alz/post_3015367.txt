"My grandmother is 79 years old and has always been an incredibly active and outgoing person.    Approximately 12-18 months ago, her personality changed suddenly and dramatically.    She is now withdrawn and quiet.    She has a flat affect and appears to suffer from anxiety and depression.    She is also convinced that she has Alzheimer's; however, tests have confirmed she does not.    She has been on Lexapro and Cymbalta with no noticeable success.    She has an unsteady gait, but her cognitive abilities are still fully intact.    She experienced a TIA several months ago.    The symptoms preceded the incident by 6 to 9 months, so I am not inclined to think the personality changed is definitely associated with the stroke.    My mother thinks she saw a story on Dateline, 20/20 or 60 minutes about elderly individuals experiencing the same problems.    They were able to recover with a specific therapy.    Does anyone have any idea what may be happening to my grandmother and any idea how we may be able to treat it?    THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
