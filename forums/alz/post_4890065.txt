"I'd like to know about how long people with late stage Alzheimer's typically survive.    I know every person is different, buti'm hoping for feedback from people who've gone thru this with a parent, friend,    & relative.    The only thing my mom doesfor herself is open her mouth when she gets fed.    A year ago, she just needed assistance & guidance but was walking,talking, using a bathrm.    She deteriorated very fast, I believe.    She's only 67 yrs, old & good physical health.    I wouldgreatly appreciate anything anyone would like to share with me.    Alzheime's is such a beyond horrible disease.Thank you very much,    Roni"
