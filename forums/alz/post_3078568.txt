It starts out with a pain her HEAD then she has slurred speach, drooling some times bad some times not but with 4 days the    pains get so bad that she is not able to do enything thats when she shows most of the signs of alzheimer's. we have all the test done for this but none of the test shows that she has ALZHEIMER'S.
