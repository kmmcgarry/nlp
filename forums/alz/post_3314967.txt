"Atrophy is noted with prominence of the sulci, sylvian fissures and ventricles along with periventricular and centrum semiovale areas of high signal intensity from chronic deep white matter ischemic changes. There are no masses, mass effects or midline shifts.Diffusion-weighted images show no evidence of areas of restricted diffusion.Can you explain what this means??Is this a form of dementia or Alzheimers???Thank You"
