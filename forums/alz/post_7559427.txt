"my mother is in a nursing home and has obvious confusion sometimes, short term memory loss, but most of all she has a lot of hallucinations.she tells me she see these things that i know haven't happened, like some man is chopping off little kids arms and legs in front of her and everyone else is just ignoring it.    she tells me she has gone places, when I know she hasn't, tells me she is now walking, when i know she can't.    She told me once the arm cutting guy was in her closet, so I looked to show her he wasn't, and she told me he built an escape door in there and got out in the other room...I tried to show her there was no such door, but she got really mad at me.    she also call apartments to set up appts to go view them with the intention of moving out of the nursing home...I have gotten a call from one of them checking on her references!They give her seroquel, but it doesn't seem to touch the hallucinations.    she also has parkinsons and the parkinsons meds can cause hallucinations, but I am not sure they cause full blown movies 24/7.    She also has Hep C, so maybe her liver is starting to take a dive as well.i'm just not sure what to do, all i know is that she wants me to take her and all the kids she thinks live in the nursing home with no arms out so we can buy them coats for the winter.    I tell her they don't exist, that it is her meds or something makeig her think they do, she gets very mad at me and starts yelling and cussing at me.Is this to be expected behaviour?    How do you all deal with things ike this?"
