"My husband has Picks disease/ frontal dementia and went for a phyical and blood work came back with high colestroal/sp .    He is in moderate phase of the disease 7 1/2 years into it.    He didn't want the medicine so I give him flax oil and cherrios .    What other things should I do?    We both don't want him to take alot of medicine which he is already on Namenda and Aricept which costs us a lot.    He is starting to have swelling of the prostate and will check it next year.    This disease starts in their 40's to 60's and usually    10 to 13 years.    He is 66 year old in sept.    Should we put a lot of money    into drugs and than he will be helpless in a few years/ like alzheimer's.    He already can't write and reading is getting hard.    Still looks normal and can do most of the things he does everyday.    He doesn't want to be on machines or kept alive if there is no quaity of life."
