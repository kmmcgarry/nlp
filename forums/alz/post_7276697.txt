"My    grand mom    has some form of dementia she is 80 years    old, when s he was    first    diagnosed with it she was saying    that     I wasn't her    granddaughter,    that    she    didn't     live    here,     she was    saying all    sorts of things,    I    love    with hr        but    so    does    my    grandfather,    I tried to get    her in the     hospital        I even    called her    doctor    but she told me    she     couldn't    make    her    come    in. OS    I    did     alot of    praying, I    loss    sleep    but    slowly    she came    back to herself    and    it was like    it never happened.    But then    today she    had a    dream    and    and she    thought it was    real    I    have    to tell     her a lot today that    it was    just a    dream    but    so far    she    hasn't     gone    off as    bad as    she    did        the    first time.    My    question    is    what    can    I really    do,    it seems    I am    the only one    that really    cares what     happens"
