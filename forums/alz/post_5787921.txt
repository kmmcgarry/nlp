"Elderly Mom on Zoloft and Risperdalby Tinkerbell920, 4 minutes agoMy mom is 93 years old and about 95 pounds. She very thin and frail and her memory has decreased rapidly in a few weeks. She suffers from depression, and is (without meds) obsessive-compulsive. Without meds she had a horrible temper and would argue about every little thing. Extremely stubborn and independent. Now she is in a nursing home after numerous falls, and never adjusted until a psychiatrist was brought in last year. She was on Effexor, and he discontinued that and started her on Risperdal 3 days ago .25mg. once a day, and Zoloft 50 mg once a day. My primary concern is her failing memory. I don't understand why Aricept wasn't started also.    2 questions:Is she too old to benefit from Aricept for memory? and I read that Risperdol can be dangerous for elderly suffering from demensia. Can her low dose of .25 mg be dangerous as she has angina, but her cardiologist who is great gave the ok to the psychiatrist's new meds. Any advice would be so appreciated. I just keep reading about all these terrible side effects and I will be doing the monitoring of any changes. Thanks"
