"My mother is 93 and she is in a nursing home..has been for a year. Anyhow she has Alz, in May she was walking up and down the halls, talking and eating well...Now she is in a wheelchair, says very little, not even a smile, and barely eats at all..Maybe a bite or two per meal if that. I have never dealt with this..they say she is in her final stages. What should I expect next. This is awful watching your parent with this disease.thank you for any advice."
