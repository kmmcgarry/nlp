"hello, I have been diagnosed with Binswanger's Disease, I am having trouble finding someone else with this disease. I am looking for a support group but have been unable to find one. The altzhimers assoc told me that their support group wouldn't help us. I want it more for my wife so she can have others to talk to. Is there any new help with someone with BD? Thanks sockspenny"
