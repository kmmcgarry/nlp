"My mom has Alzheimer's but doesn't accept the fact that she does. She's almost 94, I was a late in life baby, I'm now 51 and my mom has never wanted to accept that I've grown up. I'm an only child and my mom is driving me nuts (I'm the devil, she wishes I was never born, etc.). My question is, and I pretty much know the answer, I'm just tossing it out there is there a test for Alzheimer's ? My mom thinks there is, I say (and the doctors say) no. I just thought I'd ask anyway."
