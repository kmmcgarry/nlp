"Could you tell me in layman's terms what this means:This is results from MRI/Brain:There is diffuse atrophy.    There is a moderate burden of T2 hyperintense foci seen within the periventricular subcortical white matter bilaterally as well as some foci within the pons and compatible with chronic ischemic microangiopathy.    Diffusion images demonstrate no evidence of acute infarction.Thanks, Angie"
