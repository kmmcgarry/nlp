"My mother has alzheimers and she says she has bugs crawling under the skin on her body. The spots she shows me are old age spots our family has had them for generations.    The problem is mom is digging at them trying to get the bugs out making lots of holes in her body. Her arms and legs look alfull but I can not stop her.    She will catch me not watching or even when she goes to the ladies she picks. Is there anything I can do to help stop this? She just does not understand she does not have bugs. That would never happen in a million years as long as I have anything to do about it."
