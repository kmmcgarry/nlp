"My grandpa has alzheimers and we know he has it and it is getting pretty severe. He was diagnosed in South Carolina but we are having a hard time getting a hold of his records from SC. He is now living with my mom here in Texas and she is trying to take care of him. The problem is she works long hours so she relies on me to take care of him when I get home from work. I do without any complaints, but I really need her to stand up to him and tell him things he shouldn't be doing anymore, for example driving!He insisted on driving himself to the dentist yesterday and to the doctor today. Just to make sure he makes it ok I have to play stocker and follow him to and from the dentist. I also had to call the dentist and make sure he didn't write the check for more than what we had already agreed on.Then there is the constant accusations that me, my DH, and my children are stealing from him and tearing up his stuff. Which none of this is true. He told my mom that while they had his car in the shop we went and stole parts off of his car to fix mine. "
