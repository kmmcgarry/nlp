"I am a 22 years old and. My memory is really bad I cant retain information, I am forgetting the names of objects, I get confused. I am deprived of thoughts or poverty of thought meaning I have no thoughts in my head I am a blank page when someone asks me something nothing comes to my head I have a hard time thinking my mind is empty and numb I cant explain the world around me becaus eI get confused and forget the names of objects. I dont have insurance so I am unable to see a doc right now I had a ct scan,mri and an eeg 5 months ago and they all came back normal I also saw a psychiatrist and was put on meds but cant afford to see him the meds worked for confusion but not for my memoy. I just started a new job through a temp agency and I font think I will be able to hold it because of my problems with my mind. I lift weights, and run, and take vitamins. I was unemployed for a year on two seperate occasions and did nothing but watch tv and i have never been the same. is it possible my brain shrunk and brain cells died from the sedentary lifestyle? Please I need help and advice as to what it could be. I know I am really young but it is getting worse I feel like I deteriorate more every day."
