"I am a mother of three and married. I have had to start taking care of my mother who has this very bad disease.This has been very hard for me to do and accept because I feel my mother is to young for this.It started about 6 yrs ago after she had a major car accident. She was on her own with care givers up til 3 yrs ago and then we put her in nursing homes but that was a mistake - all they wanted to do is drug her up to sleeping all the time or call me all the time complaining. So we took her out 1 week ago and brought her home. She is doing well right now it is easy to take care of her \"just like taking care of a three year old'' . I have to be with her 24/7 and just make sure she does things in the right order.Although I do wish I had more help so I could have breaks during the days. I have a sister but she ran when she found out what mom had.I am going to do this for as long as I can because she is my mom and I love her.If any one has any words for advice for me please feel free to talk to me.Is there testing or tests that I need to make she gets or has had.I feel that this was not only from the accident but it is genetic , my mom mother had it as well.My mom had a hard life when it came to men etc. and always had mental problems. I wish now I would have been more understanding and made her get more tests done etc.Thank you for listeningThis discussion is related topreventing Alzheimer's."
