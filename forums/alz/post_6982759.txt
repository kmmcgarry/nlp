"I am 55 years old and my memory seems to be getting much worse lately. I do not know where I put most things. I do not remember some events at times. Movies I can not remember seeing or going certain places with my husband I do not remember. I get very upset at myself when I am constantly looking for things. Everything from keys to shoes to important papers. I still work but must write most things down in order to remember. I had an MRI which showed some    atrophy. A Neurologist stated I had a mild cognitive impairment butit sure does seem major to me. He gave me concerta which does not help being forgetful. This only helps me not to be so tired all the time. What do you think?    What does this atrophy represent?"
