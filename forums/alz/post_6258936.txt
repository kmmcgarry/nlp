"For the first time in at least a generation, medical experts have new criteria, a major change in the analytical guidelines for Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs. The orders, which are expected to be adopted this fall to detect Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs, would allow technology, such as brain scans, to be used to detect the disease as it is rising √¢ Ä ì even before clear memory problems or other warning signs appear.Experts predict a major increase √¢ Ä ì perhaps a threefold jump √¢ Ä ì in the number of people with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease as a result of the guidelines, according to a report in The New York Times. Around 5.3 million people now are diagnosed with the disease, the Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association says. The new guidelines reflect the belief that the disease is at hand, years before dementia symptoms appear. They include criteria for three stages of the disease: preclinical disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease and, lastly, Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs dementia.Experts presented the guidelines at the Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association International Conference on Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease in Honolulu. A board of experts gathered by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association met to develop the new approach."
