"My father ( 80yrs with Alzheimer's/mild Parkinson's symptoms)    has been a relatively \"low\" does of the risperdal for some time now.     The nursing staff claim that it keeps him from being agitated.     It however, leaves him in a catatonic state.     He cannot speak and he sits and nods off with his pupils like pinholes.     They claim this is for his \"safety\"    and that of the nursing staff.    I find this hard to believe because he is confined to a wheelchair    and cannot stand on his own.    He is a relatively weak person,    his muscles atrophied several years ago.    I have requested the doctor refrain from this chemical lobotomy but am being met with resistance.    I know that current research suggests that risperdal is infact harmful to use with dementia patients.    Has anyone had a similar experience?     I would prefer to be able to talk with my father in his final years (even if he doesn't recognize me) rather than look at someone who resembles Nicholson in the final scene of Cuckoo's nest.     Any comments would be greatly appreciated.    --J."
