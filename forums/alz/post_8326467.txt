"Hello all, I am trying to get a little clarification. My mother is 64, she recently had an MRI that showed \"stage 2 brain shrinkage\". What does this mean? She says she will likely progress to alzhemiers/dementia, but was not diagnosed with either yet (not given meds or anything). And only scheduled a routine follow up. Very worried, any idea how quick it will come?"
