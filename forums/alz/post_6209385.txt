"As far ar the progression of the disease- my Mom is losing the ability to walk.    She is incontinent.    She only speaks on occassion.    She is eating- but with her fingers.    She is still home with my Dad.    I don't think he wants to place her- but I am not sure how much longer he can keep it up.    We do have a nurse but still- it is on him much of the time.    I live in another state but go home as much as I can. I don't know what my question is! I know things just get worse and worse.    It is my Dad's call and we totlly support him.    If he wants Mom at home I want to do all I can to help.    If we need to place her- I want to make things as easy as possible for my father."
