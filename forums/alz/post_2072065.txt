"My Mom is 82 years old and as of June '07 she seemed fine to me.    She sometimes forgot names of people she met, but she recently moved into a lifecare community in FL from Vegas and there were alot of names to remember.    She has chronic UTI infections and she experienced one in June '07 that made her very confused.    She ended up in the hospital where she became paranoid and hallucinated. After 2 weeks in the health center, she went back to her apt. and other than not handling her medication, she went through 2 cataract surgeries and seemed to be coming back.    3 weeks ago she had another UTI infection that caused edema in her feet as it had gotten into her kidneys.    She was in the hospital for 3 days that caused the paranoia, irritability and hallucinations. She has been in the health center now for 2 weeks - on 100 mg of zoloft, aricept, namenda, seraquil and can't walk, is more confused and very irritable to others.    Not her normal personality.    Her neurologist has just taken her off zoloft, aricept and namenda and increased her seraquil to 25 mg 3 times a day (was 25 mg once a day at night).    I am hoping I am doing the right thing for her.    He is a well renowned neurologist and doesn't know what is causing her problems after looking at her EEG, MRI of the brain, Ultrasound of the caratoid artery and CAT scan of the neck.    I believe he thinks it is being caused by the medication.    Anybody have a similar problem with their parent?"
