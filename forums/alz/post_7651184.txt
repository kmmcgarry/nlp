"Hi,Is it normal for a senior to occasionally say the same thing twice? Over the past year, I've noticed that my mother sometimes tells me something or asks a question, only to forget and repeat the same thing ten minutes later. It doesn't happen particularly often (maybe half a dozen times so far over the span of a year), but I'm concerned because this seems to be cited as a warning sign for Alzheimer's.Aside from that, I haven't noticed any other early symptoms as her memory and ability to multi-task is generally good. She has forgotten to tend to the stove once (filled the kitchen with smoke), but she was distracted by the TV that time.Thanks,Colin"
