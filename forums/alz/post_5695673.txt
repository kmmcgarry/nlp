"I'm wondering if anyone out there has a parent or other family member with both dementia and mental illness? My father, who is 84, was recently diagnosed with possible metabolic and/or vascular dementia and bipolar disorder. He refused additional neuropsychological testing, which the folks at the memory assessment clinic recommended, and he also is refusing to be treated for hypothyroidism, which was also diagnosed at the time they ran blood tests in conjunction with the memory and cognitive assessment. The hypothyroidism could be making his memory problems worse.Anyway, he is becoming very belligerent, mean, cantankerous, etc. and his mood swings are worse than ever. I would love to hear other people's stories....The above is just the tip of a very big iceberg.Thanks,Yvette"
