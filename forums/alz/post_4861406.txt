"Does anyone have an idea of the life-span of a person (relatively healthy) who is in late stage Alzheimer's?     My mom doesnothing for herself except    open her mouth when she is fed.    About 14 mos. ago, she was walking, talking (intelligibly), &taking care of her basic needs with a little guidance.    Now she is nonverbal & sits in a wheelchair; seems like she has nobrain function, only her body is alive.    I would love to hear any feedback from anyone who has been there.    Thank you verymuch!!!    Roni"
