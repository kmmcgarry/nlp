"My 75 year old mother is coming to visit me for 2 days and nights.    She lives far away with her husband of 5 years and has been dianosed with alzheimers.    I have not seen her for a year, but have talked to her on the phone every week.    Sometimes she knows me and sometimes she doesn't.    Her husband is going away for a well=needed break.My question is this:What should I do to make her more comfortable?    Is having her do small tasks advisable?    Such as folding towels, helping to make dinner?    Do notes help in case she wakes up in the middle of the night =-such as \"You are at your daughter's house\"?Any tips you can give me will be appreciated.    Thank you!"
