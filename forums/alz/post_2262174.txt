"My father has never had any health issues other than high blood pressure and gout. He is 64. Last Saturday my mother started noticing sometime slower than normal speach and some confusion. On Monday he forgot how to do PST at work, he is an accountant. On Tuesday it took him 1 hour to do a 5 minute invoice. Apparently not remembering where on the computer to go and how to do it, confussed. Wednesday he forgot his pin number for his bank card, the same 4 digits he has used since bank cards came out. He knows his name, the date, where he lives, who we are. He just seems to be forgetting how to do work related and number related things. It is taking a toll on both my parents and my father is getting tired and discouraged. Could this be beginning Alzheimer's? There is NO family history at all! Can it happen this fast? Could it be something else?Please help, any advice is appreciated."
