"My Mother is 90 years old.    Her memory has been slipping for some time now.    However, today it took a drastic turn for the worst.    She called me and wanted to know where my father was.    She divorced him years ago and he has been deceased for years.    She denies that she has lived with her significant other for 13 years.    She also tells me that I never call her, I call her every day and spoke with her last night.    She said she wasn't home that she was with her Mother, who is also deceased.    She gets angry and says that she doesn't know what is going on and that everyone is not telling her the truth.    I know an evaluation needs to be made.    How do I proceed with that.    I can call her family doctor, but not sure how soon something can be done."
