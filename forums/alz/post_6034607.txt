"Hi - 2 years ago I went for some ear balance tests with a Neurologist.    In the CT scan he learned that I had some calcification in the brain.    I didn't ask any questions as I didn't think was a big deal.    Since that time, I have been experiencing times where I can't find the right words or I mumble a few words and literally find it difficult to remember things.    I also get anxiety when I am going to drive a distance....I wouldn't not be too worried, but my family has a history of Dimentia(dementia)and Alzheimers.    My mother passed a way one year ago from it and her brother prior to that and currently one other brother is in the latter stages of the disease.Additional concern is I had a had fall (slipped while at work in kitchen and fell head first slamming left lobe of head into wall (the office heard the bang came to my aid)....I went taken to emergency and Doctor said to follow the needed steps (wake up every 2hours) and asked if I played any active sports - I said no....Currently I am in employment transition and partially I like to believe this forgetfulness is more about stress....but then one never knows right?Should I be concerned and revisit this with Neurologist ?Any advice is appreciated.thank you.C"
