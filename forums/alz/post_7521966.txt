"Want to wish all a very happy holiday as we go throught another year.    I know this will be my last year with my sweet mom so am holding on to each day and making memories that i can carry till the end of my life on earth.mom will not know what day it is or why we are giving her wraped gifts , or even that she opened them 5 secs later but we want to let her enjoy what time she will remember on that day.     being with her each day is a gift to me, I love my mom so much i know it will be hard to be here without her but i also know shes in my heart and i belive i will see her one day when our LORD comes back.hope each and everyone of ya and your loves ones have a awesome Christmas , be safe and love each other. Barbara"
