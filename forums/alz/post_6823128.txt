"How could you detect if you are having an Alzheimer's Disease without consulting your doctor? This is so, because there are times when I am pretty sure that I know somebody who is closed to me but, there are times which I could not outright recall his name immediately, for short, it will take a couple of minutes before I could remember his name. Are there some medications which needs to take in to ensure my memory won't get worse? Please help me before it got worst? Thank you."
