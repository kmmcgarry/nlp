"I believe there is definately a good possiblity that my mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimers just because it was an easy diagnosis....however, within 3 months of my overtaking her care I saw before my eyes an extreme transformation into a bright, smiley, enjoying life woman.    She had lost her husband of 65 years and had become extremely depressed and the care she was under brought much fear to her....after 1 year she was given the MMSE test and her memory had not deteriorated at all...I have been researching possible causes for her short term memory loss, which was much of the time, selective, I have reason to believe that she suffered from Pseudo Dementia...Can you refer me to any medical studies or documented information on this subject...."
