"My husband diagnosed with pre senile Dementia (frontal Lobe) 2 yes ago. He is 68. A very brilliant man.    He is so aggressive verbally.    He will contradict everything and will not admit that what he us saying and doing is all incorrect.    There cud be arguments all day with him.    I'm stressed out.    I will take care of him but he won't relenquish control.What can I do to stop from going insane myself. HELP"
