"Hi,I am new to the community. My father had a wedge resection for stage 1 cancer.He is doing ok physically, however, mentally he is not doing so well.He is very anxious and scared all the timeHe calls me every day to ask in what order he should take his medication.He also sleeps with the lights on because he said he feels scared.I don't live with him, however, when I leave i feel awful, like I should be with him 24/7I cry every day thinking about him.He does not live alone, he has my mom (who hates him), my sister who help him, and two brothers who are not helpfulIs there anything I can do to help my father?"
