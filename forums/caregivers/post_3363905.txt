"Swampy is thinking about writing up a set of policies for caregivers. New caregivers will have to sign a copy, but current caregivers will be grandfathered in.So far, Swampy has thought of the following (and will obviously order these things and group them by subject):1. Caregiver schedule is controlled by Swampy's mom. Approve any schedule change with her.2. The caregiver is not to invite anyone to the house, unless there is a specific work related reason. Swampy's mother, naturally, can always invite someone in as a guest.3. In case of hospitalization, the caregiver must immediately notify both the health care proxy and Swampy.4. The caregiver is expected to sit with Swampy's mom at the table while she eats (and, if possible, eat with her as well).5. No caregiver is to leave dirty dishes past end of shift.6. The dishwasher will be completely emptied of clean dishes when it is first open, an open dishwasher will always contain dirty dishes.7. The caregiver is to sign in and out at start and end of shift, and to keep the logbook as required. The caregiver is to remain in the house with Swampy's mom until the next shift arrives.8. Caregivers are to maintain a polite decorum. Remember that Swampy's mom was raised in a era when formalisms such as \"please\" and \"thank you\" were a requirement.9. Swampy's mom gets to decide when she wakes up, goes to bed, uses the toilet, and eats. Caregivers must do this immediately when asked.10. Caregivers will maintain constant, predictable work hours. An occasional special circumstance may require changing shifts, however, it cannot happen often.11. Caregivers will hold information they learn through their employment confidential.12. Caregivers are not to burden Swampy's mom with their personal situations. Caregivers are to limit personal calls at work to what is minimally necessary."
