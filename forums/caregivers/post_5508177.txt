"Mom passed away this morning at 4:00 am - on her 77th birthday.    She was getting nothing but worse by the hour at Vosswood Nursing Center, and I blame them for many things that made the last days of her life miserable.    Even after a stern family meeting and ragging on them daily, they didn't act.    No regular hemoglobin checks, no visit from their doctor, and pressure sores all over her feet and tailbone after not even two weeks under their tender mercies.Had we not called an ambulance to take Mom to the hospital yesterday, none of us would have had a chance to say goodbye.    The paramedics reamed out the nurses wanting to know when the last time was \"ANY of you saw her NORMAL!\"    They couldn't answer because they haven't been checking on her.    Mom was bleeding to death and they kept insisting her hemoglobin had gone UP.    No way.    The wouldn't retest until the got new orders and naturally wouldn't call to get them.I am so angry right now I can hardly contain myself.    I alternate between wanting to bash heads and crying my eyes out."
