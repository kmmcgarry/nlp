"Hi my name is Brooke I am 32 and I have been taking care of my grandmother for about 17 months now.    She as mini strokes and heart problems with moderate dimentia(dementia).    She has 4 kids who could only agree on one thing that they all wanted her in a nursing home but she said she didnt want to go so I move her in with me.    I have a small house though so we had to build her a suite as we lovingly call it.    She is still pretty self sufficient .    I make her meals, do her meds, her cleaning, all her bills and provide 24/7 care and monitoring.    The first issue was that I have 2 small children (10 and 5) and my husband makes 15k a yr so figurng out how to afford to provide round the clock care was a challenge,    After spending 200+ hours cleaning out her home of 50 years myself, we sold it and she said se wanted to pay me mothly to be home with her.    I am wondering do I claim it so if I need help (medicare) evetually I can get it or no?? I have done this alone for 17 months with no breaks and a now so anxious and sick that most days I feel I am losing my mind. Everyone is mad at me, and I feel so alone and while I love doing this for her    feellike I have lost a part of me.    I am depressed    -- I am a state certified CNA and have worked in the field for 5yrs before taking care of her.    Please help"
