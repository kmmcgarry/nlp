"There is not a lot of activity on our Caregivers Forum. Maybe it's because we have not been \"found.\" Maybe it's because we are so busy care-giving we don't have time to post. Whatever the reason I hope we can raise some interest and activity in our community. This forum is designed to provide support and information for all Caregivers Let's see if we can do just that.So here's a poll. I hope you will find the time to participate.I care for my terminally ill 81 year old father. I also provide care for my 77 year old mother 50-60% of the time.    Who do you care for?Warm Wishes,Tuck"
