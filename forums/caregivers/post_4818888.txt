"I know that there are ppl that require oxygen that still travel. That said this is my dilemma.In several months we are planning to spend at least the winter in another state approximately a 26 hour drive from where we currently reside. We are taking my father who is in the end stages of lung disease and requires continuous oxygen. Dad is refusing to fly. Even if he would fly I have been told that the airlines will not allow oxygen on the plane.We can not possibly take enough oxygen containers in our vehicle to last the at least 3 day drive. We could make the trip faster but he can not tolerate more than six maybe seven hours of travel a day.His oxygen supply company claims he is not a candidate for their small travel concentrators. They refuse to allow us to take the large rental one out of state which would not be feasible as we traveled anyway but would offer night time oxygen as well as oxygen upon our arrival. So than what, once we arrive at our destination we must urgently find a physician that will prescribe oxygen for him....or make a trip to ER?What am I not getting? This can't be an impossibility in this day and age. I have asked these questions of his Home Health Care Providers and his rural Physician, no one can come up with a solution. Can anyone direct me or provide me with some ideas?Thank You,Tuck"
