"Hi, I am 25 year old female, whom alongside my partner take care of his mother, my future mother in law.Mil is tetrapleagic, after contracting mrsa at one of our local hospitals. We have been looking after her for 3 and a half years now.She is confined to a wheelchair, and can't do much for herself though she is as sound as a pound mentaly.I myself, have a few health issues, as does my partner, we are not what you would classify as full time care givers as I work 5 days a week in accounts, aswell as for 6 months of the year attending college at weekends to obtain my accountancy qualification. My partner is self employed and can work up to 7 days a week.We have recently in the past 12 months noticed that his mum relys on us more more and more, physically that is not an issue, I change her cathetar bag, and make sure she has her meds on time, if she is ill I have time off of work, if she requires a nurse during the night we sit up with her, but we do seem to be fighting her battles for her more and more. She seems to just accept what the nhs tells her and doesn't fight for more help or the right medicationWe have carers come in 3 times a day to get her in and out of bed, morning and night, and some one at lunchtime to give her something to eat as me and my partner work.I guess I don't know what question I'm asking really, but just wondered if there was anyone else out there in a similar situation especially regarding the dependancy of 'fighting their battles'I would like to point out I don't begrudge doing this, but I can't understand why she won't say anything, potentially feeling vulnerable?! Anyway I don't know, ill stop babbling now lol! Thanks for taking the time to read this."
