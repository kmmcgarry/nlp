"Things have improved for me since the last time I posted. I'm one of the people with \"annoying roommate\" mom. Little sister has stepped up to the plate once again to offer more help. She has offered to take mom to Europe this fall if mom is in good enough health, because this may be her last mobile year. Portable oxygen concentrators are the latest travel help on the market, and sister will drag along her hubby to act as mule for mom's shopping.Also, sister is paying for two big rounds of housecleaning while I am gone this summer, so that mom won't be living in piles of dust and dog hair, and I'll come home to a reasonably clean house. And sister brainstormed on more ways to make things keep working. Just knowing somebody is out there helping keeps me going.It will become more important in a few years when mom loses more ground, but for now I feel so much better."
