"It is very important for the enfeebled to take in enough calories and nutrients. With age comes dysphagia and little appetite. I set up a daily log and pre-prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner relying on aids to report what was eaten. Foolish me. Day after day I would see in the log: \"Lunch. She eat Good!\". \"Breakfast. She ate great!\". Then I started going through the trash bags. The meals were hardly touched. The aides, I found, had a tendency to fib. In fact their noses were longer than Pinnochio.    I placed a recording video camera over the meal area. This caused a unbelievable number of complaints. The aides refused to feed under the camera! Squalk, squalk! Oh well. I'm easy. Out went the recording camera. I then started a new program. The remains of every meal would not be thrown out but placed in the refrigerator. I would then throw the food out at the end of the day after inspecting the plates. This worked out well. It enabled me to see what foods were liked and disliked and also to insure that the aids spent more time feeding and allowed a longer interval between spoonfulls.    This takes patience. And it won't take place unless there is supervision.    It is very easy for an elderly person to slowly lose weight, especially if there is not a scale to weigh them on a weekly basis. It is important to main both a hydration log and a log of the quantity of food eaten."
