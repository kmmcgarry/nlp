"my mother who is 83 and diabetic recently was found by my sister in a diabetic coma and there are signs of an infarc. She has confusion, memory loss and mild delusion (seeing her name on walls, seeing people that are not there) but she can also have a conversation that flows until she interjects something completely off-base or not based in reality). She also does not recognize her sister but she knows her sister's grandson who was with her when they visited. Is there anything that we as the family can do to help her recover from this state?"
