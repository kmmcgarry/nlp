"One of the items I purchased for my \"little ones\" wheelchair was a D-cell battery operated bicycle horn, which I attached to the right arm of the wheelchair.    I bought it in a bicycle store. When going down the sidewalk and obstructed by a crowd she would delight in beeping our way through! This didn't go over as well in the hospital hallway when there a line for the elevator, however. In any event, the little horn gave her some control over things and provided her with some fun."
