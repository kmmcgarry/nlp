"HiMy mother-in-law has been diagonised with CBGD. My father-in-law is taking care of her right now. She is mroe or less fit excpet for the fact tht she falls down often and has speech problems. Her memory is almost unaffected. My husband is their only child and we are staying out of the country now. We wont be able to go back now. What do you suggest for the caregiver? What should be our attitude towards her? She often threats my Father-in-law that she wil commit suicide, she doesnt want to live anymore. She is 53 and under medication. Please advice.    Thanks a lot in advance!"
