"I am past all patience with my mother who has spent the last two days on the couch because she can't walk and refuses to use a walker.    My name is on her credit card and money is not an issue, so I'm looking for a motorized chair.    I'm certain any of her doctors will help us order one, but I'm not sure how the process works.Since Mom insists on remaining alone and independent, it's past time to make her home safer - whether she likes it or not.    I'm trying to prepare myself for the impending non-stop verbal abuse that is on the horizon.    I should be used to it by now...I'm looked at the scooter store and the hoveround.    Mom is tiny: 5 feet 2\" and only 93 pounds (up from 85 a few months ago but dropping again).    There are a couple of trouble spots in the house.    I don't think the bathroom doorway will be large enough.    It doesn't accomodate her small wheelchair or walker (that she won't use anyway).    She also has an island kitchen that makes for a tight squeeze in two areas.I suspect the longer, narrower scooter could navigate these areas, but I see two drawbacks.    One, it's not as stable as the chair; two, she really needs more back support than the scooter provides.Any suggestions or recommendations?"
