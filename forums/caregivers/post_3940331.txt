"Guess you could say i;m new. been to many sites.My husband has active Heb c,cirrioss auto-immune, ESLD, first stage kidney disease, and diabetic.This all became active 10 years ago when he was in ER. Turned out he had alcohic pnomia,which i guess \"turned'' everything on. He got Hep C at 16, before there was a name other than non-a or non-b. By now,of course, we know Hep C. Ten years ,even his Dr are suprised. It's sad at how many ppl stay in denial when they find something out so bad about themselves,huh? Nothind changed for a while. Then small things. I took control of dr visits, specialist, everything. He,continued to drink. We, i use ''we'' because i do all research, all answeres to dr. EVERYTHING! My life is his life.WE have been thru 3 evulations at UCLA. The one this spring, he pulled a muscle in his lung, and it was catch up all summer. I'm doing all these things knowing he is not going to get a liver, his only hope. why should he? He still drinks some, not as much because it finally makes him so sick. There are so many other ppl out there who would not abuse a new liver, and ,sadly, i don't know,if he would, but i think so. I know he is running out of time. I'm in this alone,most family members don't know he still drinks. So, i enlighten them. He is ready to leave this world,he is sick every day. and so tired. Many days he never gets out of bed. I also care alot for 3 of my grandkids. My daughter has Valley Fever, and summers are hard for her. But, she makes life hard forhehself too. I guess my question is, how do i let go? I know God is in charge of that. I also believe God's got something for him to finish and he wont open his heart and eyes to HIM. Maybe i just need a place of my own to vent some of this,whatever i have.A place where other ppl are going thru some of the same things? Linda"
