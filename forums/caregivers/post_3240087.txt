"I have a downs symdrome daughter age 32.    Up until 2 weeks ago, she was very loving and happy.    About 3 months ago she threw most of her belongings in the garbage can.    When I realized what she had done (it was too late to retrieve any of the items) she said, after much coaxing, that she had to get rid of things because someone was going to be moving in with us.     About 2 weeks ago she developed such a fear because she says there are voices in her forehead.    She says she has a twin that is trying to get her to do bad things.    She is so afraid and you can see her retreat into herself.    She has eaten nothing all day today because she is afraid her twin is trying to poison her.    I have taken her in for a CT scan of the brain and numerous blood tests which have all come back normal.    Any help for this would be greatly appreciated."
