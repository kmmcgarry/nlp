"Hello. I am 19 years old and I have to take care of my uncle. We have taken him to so many different doctors but they cant find out what is wrong. It happened all of a sudden. He goes into these episode type of things where he acts like a little kid. You have to make him food, make sure he takes his meds, make sure he dont leave the house... and to top it off he talks like a little kid. Also before this he talked fine and now of a sudden he studders in and not in his episodes. He also has to walk with a cane now. It is sooo time consuming. and being a full time college student dont help either. I wish they could find out what is wrong with him. Does anyone know of this medical problem? has anyone even heard of it?? Please help"
