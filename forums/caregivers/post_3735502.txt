"I too was not just a Momma for six years, but a caregiver to our son, at a tender age of nine he started comming to me with strange symptoms, and in the end, was said never to walk again, in his life. He had Multiple Sclerosis and Transverse Myelitis. I watched my son every day of his life struggle to walk again, but they said no. Every day for four hours at a time he attended therapy. Now, he is 19, is allowed to drive, has a wife age 17 and they have a baby. So, God is good and miricles do happen.Chrystal"
