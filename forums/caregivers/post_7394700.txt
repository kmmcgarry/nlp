"I have ghost images in my operated eye about a week after cataract surgery.     Before this I was waking up virtually sightless in the eye -- it was as though there were no lens in the eye -- which would correct in a few hours.    Since the surgery I had been sleeping with the operated eye and that side of my face on the pillow and without eye protection since that my doctor said it didn't make any difference how I slept and I didn't need eye protection.    When I slept on my back the sightlessness on awakening disappeared, but as I say I now have ghost images.    Any possible causes?"
