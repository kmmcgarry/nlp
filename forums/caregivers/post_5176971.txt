"I care for my 81 year old father in my home that has an end stage disease. Thankfully he has out lived all the \"time left\" predictions.    No medical professional thought he would make it till this Holiday Season.His wife and friends have passed. His children other than me are not close, either in miles or otherwise. He has a few siblings left but they all live hundreds of miles aways and are also elderly, one is even in a nursing home. All he really has is my husband and I. I see his sadness or melancholy.He's lost his appetite and nothing seems to spark his interest. He does continue to crochet but that's about it.    My question is how do I make this, probably his last Christmas special for him?Thank you all for any suggestions.Tuck"
