"This is a bit difficult to describe so please bear with me. My mother has some personality issues, has always been controlling, manipulative, angry and negative. That's her \"norm.\" A couple of psychologists have listed her as having a personality disorder. Now that she's getting older I'm not sure what is mental decline in terms of forgetfulness and paranoia and what's just a ploy to get our attention.She complains constantly about being in pain or having this health issue or another. Yet when I manage to get an appt. for her, she cancels it. She says she can't see anything very well but cancelled the eye appt. She complains about pain all over but has cancelled the rheumy appt. once and is considering canceling the next one. She misplaced her will several months ago, recently calls me almost every day in a panic about it, asks me over and over if I have it (I don't) but then when I mention going to a lawyer to get a new one made, she doesn't want to.Yesterday we went over and she met us outside with the comment - OK, we're going to have it out right here and now. I had no idea what she was angry about. Turns out she couldn't find her wallet. I had taken her out the day before to buy a few things and I was almost positive she had it in the car. We spent 2 hours looking for it in the house, calling her credit card and bank people and fraud people. Miraculously she walked into a bedroom and found it under a stack of clothes. Had to call them all back.This is probably an impossible question to answer but is there a way to tell what's true confusion (because I want to be helpful) and what's game playing? She is 84 and lives on her own. Refuses to move to assisted living."
