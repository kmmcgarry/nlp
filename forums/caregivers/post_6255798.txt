"I have an 87 year lod woman who is my client.    She was given 2 flu shots this year. after the second shot she started showing signs of a side affect (we think from the flu shot). She has developed red blisters all over her back side on the lower part of her back on the left side of her body, and on the front side of her left thigh it is spreading to her inner thigh and her pubic area. They have risen to have pulse in them and they ae red.    My question is, is this possible and if not what is going on with her to have this type of situation going on.    I really hate this for her, it looks like some one has pourd hot water or hot grease on her."
