"Yesterday after the funeral service we followed the hearse to lay the shell that carried my father's soul and spirit for 81 year to rest. I earlier said that this was the hardest thing I ever did.....and indeed it has been. Dad has been so much a part of me and my life. I looked after him since 1995, saw him through a difficult and long death if his second wife and in 2003 he came to live with us.Over those almost eight years my dad's health declined and I became his Caregiver. It was a long and difficult role at times but something I am not sorry that I did. My dad lived a good life and ended his years where he wanted to be, in our home, which quickly became his home too.    The last many months were more than difficult but he never lost himself and always professed his love and gratitude for my love and care. He left me with many gifts than only a great father can leave their daughter.But this post is about Caregiving and not about my father or I. To all of you that care for loved ones, rather it's a grandparent, a parent, sibling, son or daughter, please know that in the end it is worth every moment that you sacrificed your needs over for their needs. Say the things that need to be said while you may; leave no stone unturned no matter how difficult it may seem at the time. The time will come that you will be glad you went there.There were moments that I doubted my choice to keep my dad at home...it was the greatest gift I could have given him...but again it was the hardest thing I ever did. I promise you that you will not be sorry for what you are doing. If you still have your Mom or Dad on this earth than please hug them today. Let them know how much you love them.God Bless each and everyone of you. I will be and am forever grateful for the time I had with my dad......and of course for all you support and kind words.Still....Mel's Daughter,~Tuck"
