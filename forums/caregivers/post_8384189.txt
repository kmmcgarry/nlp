"A nice gift for someone in a nursing home, either on a temporary basis (for rehab) or permanently, is a small metal lockbox that can fit in one of the small bedside drawers allotted residents. They sell for between $8.00 and $20.00 U.S. circa 2012 and come with either keys or combination locks. If you get one with a key have extra keys made before you take it to the home. Seal one key in an envelope and secrete it somewhere in the room (A good place is under a drawer) and keep the other one. If you get a combination lock set it to an easily remembered combination, such as the year the patient was born.    A nice touch for a female patient is to spray-paint it pink and apply a floral decal. Though the amounts are small,    money and inexpensive jewelry tend to disappear in nursing homes. I'm not sure if the issue is kleptomania, but there is a surroundings where there are many people with dementia wandering around. Patient's like to have a small amount of cash handy for vending machines and snacks. Keeping cash unsecured indefinitely is an invitation for problems."
