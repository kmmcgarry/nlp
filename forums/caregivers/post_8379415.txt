"When an elderly person is in a subsidized elderly \"project\", and either dies or ends up in a nursing home the \"landlord\" often sends a notice ordering the apartment to be surrendered wit the end of the month. The notice is official, generally coming from the office of an atorney. In the case of a death this means the apartment must be cleaned out within a space of perhaps two weeks. In many cases this is an impossible burden for relatives, who may also be frail and elderly.    In the situation with a nursing home, it may mean if the person is released from the home they will have no apartment. The fact of the matter these letters are bogus, designed to frighten and intimidate, and in point-of-fact the landlord has to utilize \"due process\" to evict. (To forestall eviction someone has to continually occupy the apartment). \"Due Process\" means a court hearing at housing court.    You won't need an attorney if you are only \"buying time\". At every court hearing at the first appearance you are entitled to what is called an \"all-purpose adjournment\". If you request this there will be another court date scheduled. You don't have to give a reason for an \"all purpose adjourment\".    You cannot be forced to vacate the apartment unti the judge issues an order, and then you mwill have additional time.    In case of death this gives you fron one to three additional months to clear out the home. In the case of a nursing home situation, the matter becomes more complex. In the case of one elderly woman I am involved with she was placed in a rehab nursing home and ended up with a guardianship, for complicated reasons. She is an artist and her apartment is filled with art she created. We went to court to forestall eviction and after two years, she still has not been evicted (we are still in court), although she has been in a nursing home, hoping to be eventually released."
