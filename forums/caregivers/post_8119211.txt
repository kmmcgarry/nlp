"I started caring for a woman named Inez when she was 99, and paralyzed from a stroke. Initially she had difficulty in moving her hands to feed herself. One of my goals was to get her to start using her hands and arms and to strengthen them. One of the structured activities I developed was the use of soft colored modeling clay. The sessions worked best when they were at the same time and for no longer than thirty minutes. I made some cute animals (copying ones I saw on the internet because I wasn't that creative)    up and then rolled the clay soft and let her take a try. When she made an animal I would clay and express delight and we would place it on display. It is difficult to find activities that both encourage use of hands and coordination and can be experienced and be fun to someone who can hardly move. The clay could also be brought into a nursing home, and be part of a visit. I would not leave it around (except for any animals made) because the homes do not approve of \"mess\". I have had trouble leaving art supplies that included paint, for example, having been told those activities could only take place in the recreation room. With the clay, you could enjoy a time with a bedridden patient using the tray that they eat their meals off of."
