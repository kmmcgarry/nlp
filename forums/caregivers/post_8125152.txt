"Caregiver222 has developed a system for insuring the elderly are properly hydrated. It is extremely important to make sure the elderly keep properly hydrated and in most places this is done by \"guestimate\".    Some nursing homes use astrology. Others use the Vulcan mind meld. I suggest there is a better way.    In most all facilities the aids arrive with a cup and straw or glass filled with a single flavor of drink. The system entails purchase of small plastic cups, in either a two-ounce or three-ounce size. You don't serve liquids in glasses.    The second part of the system is NEVER to serve only a single flavor of beverage. At meals I follow the \"four-flavor\" rule. Four cups containing four different flavors of beverage. Orange, banana, milk, water.    Chocolate milk, pineapple juice, tomato juice, iced tea. You get the idea. My little one always wanted at least one cup of plain old water. At snack time I change this to the two-flavor rule.    I like contrasting flavors of beverage. Orange juice and chocolate milk (in separate two-once servings) were a special hit.    The small quantities ensure that if the drink is not used expensive ensure or juice will not be wasted, and if there is a spill there will not be a great mess. Elderly patients satiate quite readily on a single flavor of beverage. As the cups are emptied they are stacked near the patient. At the end of the day the empty cups are counted and an exact measure of daily hydration is available. All patients should have a small permanently bound book by their side in which the aids make notations. I use the inexpensive marble grade-school notebooks. And every day is kept a written record of hydration."
