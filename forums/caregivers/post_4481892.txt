"My husband was supposed to go to a group session this morning because he is a opiate addict. He decided he was too tired and didn't feel like going. Later he said, \"he wasn't like \"them,\" and nothing in common with blacks and streetwalkers.\" I said, \"How can you judge these people that you haven't even met yet?\" He's prejudice and doesn't think he's an addict. He's on Subonex for opiate addiction. I told him that he was just trying to get out of going. We had an arguement.Right now I am so sick of his attitude and lack of understanding what he is doing to our life together. He blames everything on me and I am just sick of it.How can I get through this? He is 72, had a heart attack, a stroke, back surgery, 2 knee replacements and has been addicted to pain pills for the last 15 years. The Methodone that he took because of being in so much pain with his knees broke the camels back. His brain and body simply said, \"Enough is enough!\" So that is his story briefly stated.I have gone through so much with this man. I am just spent. I don't know how much more I can take. He has unfinished projects all over the house. Things are falling apart and he is very messy. I am so tired of waiting for him to clean up his act. Especially when he begins blaming everything on me. ...like this morning.Tell me how I can do this? I feel like our relationship has become toxic. For me its imparitive that he get through this program. I know that group therapy would benefit him. But so far, he's looking for reasons not to go."
