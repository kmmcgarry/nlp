"I'm new to dealing with dementia, so I'm wondering how many people see the same thing I'm seeing in my Mom.    She doesn't understand time anymore.    She'll nod off for a few minutes or take a nap and wake up in a panic thinking a whole day has passed with no attention or food.    Mom really believes she has been dumped in a home and ignored by the staff, even if they just left the room 5 minutes ago.    Is this problem with the passage of time common with dementia?Mom was tripping out on her lunch ticket today.    She sat there reading it aloud, and what she read was NOT what was printed on the paper.    She believes it's a note from some florist who won't deliver her flowers because she's allergic to lilies.    \"See?    It says so right here!\"    I'm flummoxed.    My mother has always been a huge reader and always felt the worst thing that could happen to her would to lose that ability.    It breaks my heart that she seem to be losing the one joy she had left in life.    Is it common for dementia patients to actually \"see\" something on paper that doesn't exist?I guess I'm trying to prepare myself for the changes that are coming faster and faster."
