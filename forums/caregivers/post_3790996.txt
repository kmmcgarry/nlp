"Hi, I'm 40, single and have been a caregiver, while working full time, for my elderly frail mom (age 77) who has COPD (and has been on 24 hr oxygen for the last 10 years), and Schizo-affective disorder.    She recently became very weak after repeated UTI's and could no longer walk on her own with her walker as she has normally been able to do.    When I took her to the hospital where I was sure they would admit her, the dr refused to admit her to hospital and made me put her in respite care within our local LTC facility.    I've come to the realization that it's time for her to be in LTC and although I've been gearing up for it for the last year (I knew it was coming), it's definitly tougher than I thought.    I've been gearing her up for it, and she's been okay with it so far.    They at least at my insistence ran some bloodwork and discovered her hemoglobin is very low at 89 and I had to insist to her dr that he do some further testing to find out where she's losing blood.    While I know she's too frail to receive treatment if it's a serious illness (cancer, anything requiring surgery) it could be something easily treatable.    I'm having a lot of trouble with the dr. wanting to do tests and actually treat her with iron supplements to boost her iron level.    Is this a common thing with drs and LTC patients?    I was shocked and dismayed at her normally helpful family dr.Anyway, a bad week at a bad time.    At least she looked and sounded better when I visited today.Debbie"
