"Oxygen will spontaneously ignite when coming into contact with oil or vaseline. While everyone is familiar with the \"no smoking\" rule, not all know about the \"no petroleum product rule\". This is what is called a hypergolic reaction. No flame or heat is necessary. The problem becomes serious when a patient at home on an oxygen cannula complains to his/her health care aid, who may speak no known language and apparently obtained her certification by sending in boxtops, shows up with vaseline to place in the nostrils to make her charge \"more comfortable\". I have actually seen this happen and fortunately was able to prevent it from happening. If a patient uses oxygen,    vaseline or oil based products should NEVER be used on their lips or face. If you have a loved one on oxygen this fact must be conveyed to every aid that comes in to assist her, without exception. I place this warning in writing in a document called \"rules of the road\" that every aid must sign at the time they begin to work."
