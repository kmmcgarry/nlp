"Hi, I visit my Mom in long term care, she is getting dementia.    I get mad at her because she keeps repeating herself, yelling for \"Help\" when she doesn't need it.    I know I should just ignore her repeations and try to reassure her, but I find myself thinking of how strong she was and now she is so helpless.    I am also caregiver for my 50 year old sister who is brain damaged.    Some times I get so overwhelmed.    My brother and sister live far away and my other brother , who lives in town, has suffered 3 strokes in one night and he cannot speak or walk.    He can understand, but he cannot get across what he wants.    Thanks for listending."
