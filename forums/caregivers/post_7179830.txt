"Hi there I have a concern, I have had this problem for at least 2 years may be more cant remmember how long exactly. Basically im a Male, 26, and live in a home. I have a problem with my bladder ie urinary since I went into a mental health hospital on section after trying to take my life. Ever since I was diagnose with depression, anixety as well I also have Pulmonry Valve Atresia (Heart Conditon), I also have learning disabilty as well which is mild. My sister died when she was 18 years old and hence my mental health problems kicked in. Back to the bladder problem, at night for about 2 years ive been having accidents at night and im embarresed to tell my staff and alsoi ive tryed everything I can think of ie even not drink so much before bed and during the day but then I struggle to swollow sometimes and scared thats why i drink alot of fluid. I empty my bladder before bed some times work sometimes dont. Just stuck in what to do and whats wrong with me? I have been to my local GP but they was rubbish and focked it off. I try telling the owners here but they said its because I drink too much which I do I try cutting down but because of my swolling problems im scared and worried! What shall I do? This is genuine and im not attention seeking or nothing like that so please dont be horrible about it, it took me guts to write this. Thanks any advice be appricated."
