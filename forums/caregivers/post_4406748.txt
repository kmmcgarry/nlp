"My husband is on SSI for a very long time due to a AVM on his brain leading to brain surgery and the end results have to have a new skull cap poured in because of a hugh staff infection that almost cost his life set in. Leaving my husband blind in one eye and poor vision in the other. Deth in one ear and selective hearing in the other. He is on 500mg Diliatin per day. He has to fight seisures every day and has gran-mal seisures 1-2 times a month. He does not drive. I do everything for him. He does not or should not be left alone. I am not complaining now because I love my husband and would do anything for him. I just need to know if there is any care taker payments out there for me that can help us out a little. He is on SSI and I am forced to stay home with him.Any suggestions?? Peace and GOD Bless. Pam"
