"I am a single parent and I am my sons caregiver.    My 19 year old son has been a c-4 ,c-5 quadriplegic for 4 years now. I am wondering if there is anyone out there careingfor a SCI patient?    Or anyone who is careing for their own child?    I can really use some help in trying to find some type of balance in all this.Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."
