"Hey, I'm wondering if there are other young couples (late 20's, early 30's perhaps) trying to balance caregiver/patient roles vs. keeping their relationship young, fresh, and romantic.    I'm not finding many role models to guide how we should navigate this . . . it seems little of the information we find on caregiver issues applies to our situation.    The one book I read on young people with chronic illness really sugar-coated the relationship aspect of it as if it were only natural for the trials and tribulations we go through to bring us closer.    In a way, yes.    But, we live in the real world, and dealing with the intrusions of home health care, the demands of doctor visits, the strains of trips to the emergency room and hospital stays, and just the day-to-day caregiver stuff . . . that all puts a strain on things and doesn't let you live the life you imagined for yourselves at this age.    I would love to talk to others in this situation.    I'm not the caregiver, but that patient, so I hope it's not inappropriate for me to post here.    The two of us are trying to work together on finding balance in our relationship, and having a relationship that exists beyond the confines of my illness.    I'm posting on behalf of the two of us."
