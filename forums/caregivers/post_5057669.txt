"Ok so my question is I just filled out the application for Medicaid to pay for a personal care attendant in my home.    And I was wondering how long this usually takes because I need one ASAP and I am having surgery next week won't be able to walk, take a bath, prepare meals or drive basically.    So I was wondering how long it takes usually?    I'm a physically and mentally disabled individual."
