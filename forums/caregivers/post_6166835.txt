"Sis was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer Stage IIIc August 2007. I flew from MI to TX for surgery, recovery, first chemo treatments, stayed 2.5 months. Of all her friends, only two take her to chemo treatments. As for a caregiver, I'm \"it\". She has no children, and our parents and brothers are deceased. I have made subsequent trips when she needed me.    She is 50 and her CA125 numbers are climbing again--rapidly. Oncologist has her on estrogen blocker this time, as no tumors detected on CT scan, no symptoms, and is weary of months and months of chemo (3 recurrences).    Her employer has been wonderful, and she is still working, mostly from home.I have Bipolar Disorder II, managed caregiving pretty well in the past, but worry that I won't be able to give her the quality of care she needs next time. I love her so much and am terrified of losing her. The best I can do now is long phone conversations 4-5 times a week (we've been Phonezillas even before cancer). We've started 3 way phone conversations at her appointments. It helps to be as present as possible and ask her oncologist questions and listen to what she says to her doctors. Internet searches have yielded no results for sole caregivers from a distance. Is there anyone else out there?Any advice is most appreciated."
