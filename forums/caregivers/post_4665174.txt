"My husband has had many labels put on him since he has begun the process of eliminating opiate and dexedrine use. They have labeled him as manic, skitzophrenic, bi-polar, depressed etc. He has been given meds for all these symptoms. He is showing absolutely no signs of getting better. He is 72 yrs old.Within 4 yrs he has gone from a very physical person to someone I don't know. He's difficult to talk to, he seems to be on the edge all the time and the least little thing upsets him.He has started so many projects only to discover that he can't do it. So things sit and are piling up. He wanted to put crown molding in the office (do it yourself kinda guy) only to realize that he won't be able to do it. We are taking back tools that he bought and supplies to the store for a refund.My house was a place of refuge for me. I like an orderly environment (not obsessive though), just organization. Right now we painted the office and I am sitting in the middle of it using a banquet table for my pc with plastic sheeting everywhere. It's driving me crazy. We can't put anything together because we need to hire someone to replace flooring. It's just chaotic.My question is how do you live with someone who is delusional, manic, skitzophrenic, etc, etc? The conversations around here are minimal to say the least and then when we do talk ......it's just weird.I do have to say that I'm glad that I just joined Celebrate Recovery at my church. I think it will be good for me and my husband. He's in another class from me so that's good.Is anyone else going through this with a spouse? Can you share any insights or tips or anything?Frustrated to the max!"
