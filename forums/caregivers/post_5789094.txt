"My family needs help. My grandfather had a stroke 6 weeks ago. It was not massive and the doctors thought we a few weeks of rehab he would be able to go home. They moved him to a reahab place. He has trouble with his left side but knows us all and talks to us. They had some trouble with blood pressure and heart rate but reworked his meds and that is all fine. But he completely refusses to eat at all, and won't rehab. He is very mean at times. He complains that everything taste terrible even water. He says he feels like he is going to through up, but he never has. He has lost 30 lbs in 5 weeks. We don't knwo what to do. Every 5 days or so he will have a good day and eat somthing and we are encourged then the next day nothing...We tried everything we know. Has anyone else delt with this?? How can we get him to start eating or trying to get better?"
