"My 86 year old Mother is in ltc, she has been for 2 years.    My Father was in the same one for 2 years, before he died 2 years ago.    I had been their caregiver, as my husband died 10 years ago.    I have a younger sister that was brain damaged at birth, whom I take care of now.    I am her guardian.    Mentally she is about 6.    I have been suffering from depression for about 20 years.    I have a bother and sister out of town.    My bother has tried to get money out of my Father, Mother and now my sister who gets SSI and medicare.    He has been a college student for about 20 years.    He says that he will pay back the money that he wants to borrow, but never does.    He should just get a job!    Sorry, I just want to vent.    I feel bad because I am the only one who visits my Mom.    My sibs came for Dad's funeral and they went thought his clothes, tie tacks, etc, and looked high and low for his will!.    I just wanted my Dad back when he could talk."
