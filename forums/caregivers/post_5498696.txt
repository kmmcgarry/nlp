"My Dad is 84 years old and still drives. We think he is a hazzard on the roads, as his reaction time is so very slow and he panics so easily.    Do you think we could speak with his doctor about this?    My concern is can the doctor even speak with me about this, without my Dad's permission?    Is there any agency to whom we should report him, although I would HATE to \"turn him in\" - I know it's just a matter of time before someone gets hurt.HELP"
