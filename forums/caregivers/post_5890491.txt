"I live and help my mom and dad who is suffering with the dreadful disease.    I try my best to keep things going.,    The problem is my bipolar is getting worse.    I don't know if it's because my hep c is causing other emotion feelings. like like the causing all these feelings I have this morning.    Being a caregiver is a big job - responsible for their meds, taking them doctors, hoping they don't fall, dealing with their angry and the memory problems. I've bee taking care of them since 2009.    I never know what's going to happen next.    Same with me.- this illness triggers my illness."
