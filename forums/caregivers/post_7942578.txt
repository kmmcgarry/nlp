"my father 88 years old/lives with me and husband has end stage kidney disease and heart failure/barely hanging in there as well as myself being the only family member left to care for him.I got him on title 19 for the connectiucut homecare program which promises home health aide and homemakers.the home health aide they sent 6 weeks ago for only 1 hour 3 mornings a week at 10 am because that id the time that works best for him/started calling out sick 3 weeks ago and the home care agency who she is hired through started sending different aides who some my father was not comfortable with.i explained this to the agency with no understanding/today they sent an aide who took a bag full of dirty diapers he wears and self cath units he uses for self catherization and without gloves on put the bag on my kitchen counter and then without washing her hands started to make his breakfast/my father is very sharp mentally and got very upset/I then made his breakfast called the agency and had my father tell them what happened.also the aide confronted me in my own living room as she was leaving my home to tell me she heard me tell my husband while i was talking to hime in our bedroom with the door closed/that my father did not like her and wanted to know from me how is she expected to take care of hime when he does not like her.she also was complaining when she arrived at my home about having to drivefrom a other town away for only an hour.I told the agency all this and called the state case worker though the agency on aging in ct and the responce was that my father is not being flexible enough and that everyone wants 10 am for a shower and maybe they will have to change agencys which will mean he will loose the nurse he has confidence in.I am so disgusted by these uncaring attitudes/and i do not know what to do.I do not know when we will get and aide again.with my fathers advanced kidney disease he needs showers to prevent UTI infections and it helps the itching he gets from the advanced kidney disease.I know maybe can can get a shower at later or earler in the day but he does not have much longer to live and I feel some compassion ans professionalismshould be demostrated when delivering home care for thr elderly.the state wants people to stay in their homes rather than nursing homes/also puts an awful burden on the family and then gets ruse and sarcastic when you only are asking for help.please if anybody reads this and can relate or offer suggetions please do so.i live in connecticut."
