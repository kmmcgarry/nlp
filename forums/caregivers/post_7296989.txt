"I feel guilty for two things earler this year I had to make a touf choice.    We had to put my Father in Law in a home he suffered a massive stroke after brain surgery and his seizers were starting to get bad and make him disorenated he almost burnt our house down while my son(who is 5) and I were a sleep.    I also was the full time care giver to my Mouther who passed of cancer. ( She passed May 26th of this year)    My ? is Is it normale to feel guilty I feel like maybe I didn't do anuf for my Mom (her lung culapsed) I was thier holding her hand whin she passed and put everything on hold to take care of her and I just don't have the know how to take care of my Father in Law but everytime we see him He makes me feel even worse"
