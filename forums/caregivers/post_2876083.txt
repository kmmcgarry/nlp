"I am the mother of a very irritable 14-year-old child with spastic Cerebral Palsy. He is also mentally retarded and has the mental capacity of an 18-month-old baby. He is incontinent and must wear adult diapers. It is becoming increasingly impossible to stretch a diaper over him due to the startling size and intensity of his erect penis that extends WELL past his belly button, and it is increasingly difficult to keep my 10 y/o daughter out of the room while I clean him up.    I don√¢ Ä ôt want to hurt him (bend him) so it pokes out under his t-shirt until it subsides, if at all. I hesitate to let my daughter bring her little friends over to the house for obvious reasons. A friend of mine who is also a nurse and caretaker of my son suggested the possibility of giving him special medicine to stop the effects of puberty on his body (penis), completely eliminating any further sexual development as well as curb the natural urges for sex that come with semen production. Because he will always be a baby mentally, she seems to think my pediatrician will prescribe a strong testosterone suppressant that will keep him flaccid and much more comfortable and happy. Are their any long-term health risks related to this kind of body alteration? It sounds so awful√¢ Ä ¶ Is this really a common, legitimate treatment I should look into for my disabled son?"
