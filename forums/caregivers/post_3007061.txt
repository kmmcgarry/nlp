"My father in law had a bedsore starting.    We used Bag Balm alternated with Emu Oil.    The external redness has almost gone away but under the skin is a lumpy mess and it is quickly getting bigger.    Does anyone know what this is and what to do about it?    I will call the doctor on Monday but of course, it's Friday.    A nurse friend told me it might be a boil or cyst starting.    I would like to get it taken care of before it bursts open.    Any suggestions?"
