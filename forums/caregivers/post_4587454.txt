"This forum does not appear to be very active. Are there members out there that are coming here frequently? I've noticed that some questions don't have a responseI am caring for my 80 year old father. I will soon begin year five. I love him very much but I am worn out. I also have a chronic pain condition and some days can barely care for myself.    I can't consider alternative placement at this time. Guilt would be worse than the increased pain I am experiencing if he were not with me. There are no alternatives, no one to give me respite. It would just be helpful to share with someone the daily challenges that a caregiver faces.Are there others that are caring for elderly parents or grandparents?Thank You,Tuck"
