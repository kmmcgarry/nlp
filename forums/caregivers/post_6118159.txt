"My 89-year-old father is caring for his 60-year-old wife who is in the end stages of multiple sclerosis.    In addition to lining up Arizona government-based home care, meal delivery and anything else, I would like him to have a medical alert device, possibly a wrist band type.    He still drives, sometimes long distances, and does not carry a cell phone.Any advice on the best medical alert companies?"
