"Hello everyone,II don't know much about care giving from my end. I've talked with many people who have to face it and deal with it and I can give them lots of suggestions from my own training and studi. It seems almost endlesss the ideas we can come up with to help.But now, with my husband usually in deep depression and myself fluctuating from low to average I am finding even thinking of how ro cope an impossible task. I know it's part of the illness but I keep seeing myself giving so much advice and now, when I have to do it, there's nothng there.I'm not sure if I just burnt out over the years, working and dealing with hubby's problems but it seems that, suddenly, I've got nothing.Any thoughts please? Any help appreciated."
