"If you have a loved one in a rehabilitation facility of nursing home is is a good idea to have them sign a medical proxy permitting you access to their medical records and to periodically make an appointment to review them for accuracy. Notations by nursing home staff can have tremendous consequences if, for example, an attempt is made to transfer the patient or get them into an assisted living facility. One little friend of mine is now in a rehab nursing home. To get her into assisted living she has to be certified to be able to walk without assistance and pass a stair climbing test and have these facts certified by the nursing staff. Unfortunately this person has a notation that they require an aide to be with them because they are \"fall prone\" and cannot safely walk without such assistance. What actually happened is this: The person was tired of being neglected by staff (or so she felt), and noted that patient's who fall get lots of attention. And special rehab. Thus, she \"staged\" make-believe falls (according to her own account), not recognizing the consequences. In any event, don't resistate to investigate and question irregularies in the record that you know may not represent absolute truth."
