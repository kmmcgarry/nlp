"My father, a long-time paraplegic with diabetes, just learned that he will have to be bed-bound for the rest of his life on account of skin ulcers that will not heal.    He is torn between resigning himself to a nursing home for the rest of his life (which could be another year or another 40 -- he's in his 50s now) and just going back home, where he lives alone, and doing whatever he wants until an infection kills him.    This would probably happen in 1-2 years at the latest, based on his medical history.    I've been trying to convince him to give the nursing home a shot for a year or two so my husband and I can buy a house near our family and move him in with us (living in his house is not an option, nor would it save money -- he owes more on it than it's worth).    We're both 27, and we currently live in a small apartment 1500 miles away from him.    What I'd like to know is how much in-home caregivers tend to cost, per hour, or what the range is.    My husband and I both work full-time, and my father has a set amount of money for aid and attendance from the government.    I had assumed his income would be enough for someone to come in a few hours a day, change the dressing on his wounds, and make him lunch, but the more I learn, the more expensive and impossible everything sounds.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation?    What did you do?"
