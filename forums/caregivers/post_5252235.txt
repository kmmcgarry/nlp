"I lost my mother last week. She has been living with me for the last seven years after my father passed away. She seemed to be doing well for an 89 year old, when suddenly one night she developed acute abdominal pain . Shifted her to ER and they diagnosed her with intestinal obstruction.Put her on IV fluids but was not subjected to surgery.She passed away after 6 days.There are a lot of questions that are haunting me and making it very difficult for me to accept her death with this cause. She had had no surgery ever except a surgery to her leg because a year ago she had femur fracture.How can she develop obstructions in intestine so suddenly?Anyone having any answers please tell me."
