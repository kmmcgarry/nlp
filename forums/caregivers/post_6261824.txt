"My 88 year old Dad has experienced over the past six weeks seven 'flu like' attacks that last for approximately 3 hours each.    No fever and no pattern, but he complains of 'flu like' symptoms and has difficulty talking when these attacks come upon him.    His blood pressure reading is high, (170 / 110), during the last episode which was this morning just after he awoke.    He tells me that the attacks are not getting any worse but he sounded pretty scared and was stuttering some over the phone this morning."
