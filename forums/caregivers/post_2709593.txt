"Hello everyone, i am new to your group and am hoping i can help you and that you can help me. Like most of you, i was thrown into the caregiving position by accident. car accident, that is. my husband was on his way home from work a few years ago. A driver with a horrendous driving record slammed into the back of his car, forcing him into oncoming traffic where he was broadsided and hit head on, leaving him with permanent damage to his brain, respiratory and skeletal systems. (driver suffered broken rib). I know this sounds horrible, but i think all of us, including him, would have been better off had he not survived.I am 45 now and am so tired and resentful. sometimes i want to punch the surgeons who were patting themselves on the back for his so-called \"recovery.\" (I have sinse learned that \"recover\" does not mean you get back to where you started pre-accident or illness, but is a point where you no longer qualify for 24/7 \"professional\" medical care.)I must be honest. I have immense family, friend and community support. Had I not, i think our son and I would be doing significantly worse. I am very grateful for their kindness. My husband needs constant supervision and attention. I feel for him because I believe he is cognizant enough to realize that things are not what they were. I feel drained and exhausted. I am hoping there is someone here who can identify with me. I was reading the post on \"touchingm\" and that resonated with me. I just had my hair done about a month ago and a high school girl washed my hair. I felt like i was in heaven, when I realized she, this young stranger, is the first person to lay hands on me in more than 2 years. I could go on and on. I look forward to hearing back from you.Also, I have been thru the ringer, health, disability and auto insurance, legal battles, court fees, etc. perhaps my experiences will help some of you. I am very happy to do so, very truly, cosmo23"
