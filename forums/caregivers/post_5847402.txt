"Hello Fellow Caregivers,Recent discussions have left me wondering what you see as your largest challenge. Being a 24/7 Caregiver in itself is challenging. If you had to select one thing what would it be?I know that it may be difficult to select just one thing but please try. I am leaving a selection for \"other\" so you may share the challenge I may have over-looked. Sometimes I think these challenges get all meshed together and it is difficult to sort them out. As I began listing the them I realized how many there can be. I know there have been days that I have had many of these feelings surface.Please share with us your choice and than please take the time to post your thoughts. We are all in this together. As a unit, with support and understanding from one another and sharing of ideas and solutions we can help each other through this, the hardest thing I have ever done.In a week or ten days I will follow this poll with how you over came some of the challenges that we face. Following that poll I'll ask you about the joys and rewards that come from Caregiving, as I know there are many of those also. So please be thinking about those things.If you are in need of a hug today as we caregivers often are, here's one from me. (((HUG)))!Looking forward to hearing from you all.    Don't forget to Laugh whenever you can. :)    It helps our soul!~Tuck\"I always wanted a happy ending... Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it without knowing what's going to happen next. Delicious ambiguity.\"~Gilda Radner ~"
