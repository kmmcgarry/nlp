"I have no clue where to ask this and I only hope someone can help point me in the right direction.My aunt has been hospitalized for a while now.    I am not sure of all the details of what she has, but I know she has not been given a timeline for death or anything like that.    She is alert, responsive, fully cognizant and if it were not for the trachiotomy she could talk.    She is able to write and communicate with everyone that way.    She will laugh, cry, etc.The doctors told my cousin (her daughter) today that since there are no nursing homes to take her (they are in New Orleans and the ones that are operable have no openings) that they would have to pick a day for the family to come in and say goodbye and they would pull the plug on her ventilator (the only life support she has).I don't see how they can just pull the plug on an alert person.    I have heard cases where people fight to pull the plug on comatose ones.    This is not the case here.    She is not ready to leave this earth.The only other option that was given was for her to go home with her daughter, but my cousin was told she would have to stay awake 24/7 to watch her and if she died while there that they would charge my cousin with negligent homicide.I am getting all of this second hand (I am in Kentucky as my husband is in the Army) but this makes absolutely no sense.We don't know where to turn with this -- do we need to talk to the Department of Human Services, an attorney, the hospital administration?Please someone help point us in the right direction.    This is unbelievable to me.    I don't know how such little value can be put on a life."
