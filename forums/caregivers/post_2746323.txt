"About four years ago while hospitalized for a psych evaluation after he had went to the ER for alcohol poisoning the doctor their diagnosed him with schizoaffective disorder. He was prescribed Haloperidol but he never took it and ended up in jail two months later after crashing his car into a persons fence. He lost his job and began drifting around the streets living in dope houses as he later told me before me and my husband finally got him into outpatient commitment. Now they have him on his medication in a time released 2 week form but he complains that the drugs are damaging his brain and making him feel like hes being tortured and he continues to claim that he doesn't have any illness at all. Our doctor told us that the side effects of the medication can cause anxiety so he prescribed restoril, cogentin, elavil and lamictal to go with it and claims his inability to understand his illness is something called anosognosia or however its spelt. The medication seems to be working fine except that he's basically a zombie. It's like he's not my son anymore and I asked the doctor if he could lower the dosages or try some other medications but the doctor claims that he would just stop taking them again if he were able.Are these pills just knocking his brain out or are they treating a medical disease?"
