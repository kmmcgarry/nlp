"Ok, I'm not really sure where to start so here it goes.With in the past 3 months my family has been through the ringer. We found out that my father-in-law, my biological father, my aunt, and my uncle had cancer. Then there's my other dad who has something like cancer in his foot that is making him have to think about amputation.Sadly we lost my uncle a week and a half ago and my aunt has all but given up.My question is with everything that is going on depression has been running through the rest of my family like wild fire. I am trying to be there for everyone but am not sure how exactly to do it.    I feel like the world is crumbling beneath me sometimes.If anyone has any advice or suggestions PLEASE!!!! Anything will be appreciated.THANK YOU IN ADVANCE!!!!"
