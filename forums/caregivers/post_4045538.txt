"I recently had my dad placed in a nursing home, becuz it was clear he no longer could funtion at home. After seeing the way he is living, I, too would like to live in a home, just not the one he does. Dad's is a low budget one without air conditioning. He gets his meals made for him, laundry done, no clean up at all. Housekeeping even takes care of his hideous plants. I'm getting up there in age myself.(53) and i'm thinking this might be what i need. Dad has his own wheelchair n the nurses actually push him to dinner. no work for him at all. They even give him a bath n he doesnt need to lift a finger. Man, i would love that. What r the requirements to live in a nursing home in west virginia?"
