"My father just lost his wife of 61 years, two months ago. He is depressed and at times anxious. The medical society tells him to, well, tough it out for at least another 6 months. If I was depressed for two weeks straight, I could be considered clinically depressed. So why can't he get help with his grief and depression. It is a situational depression but so much depression is instigated by a traumatic situation. What gives here? Isn't this a bit prejudicial? He is 84 for pete's sake!"
