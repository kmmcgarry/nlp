"To my chagrin and irritation another medical information site has been posting glowing endorsements of nursing homes by \"caregiver222\".    I have been using this handle for many years, professionally, in songwriting and in writing, and the \"222\" comes from the hospital room where a loved one died. This particular site has paid advertisements by nursing homes, some of which are the subject of numerous federal deficiency complaints involving the deaths of patients. They have essentially lifted my identity as caregiver222 to endorse these questionable homes, have admitted they have done so, and essentially said \"sue us\". If this was 1814 caregiver222 would be happy to settle the question the way President Jackson settled his problems, but I am law-abiding and moral, and my PTSD from Vietnam these days is under control. In any event, since I have received messages regarding endorsing these homes from people on Medhelp I wish to state that such postings, using the handle\"caregiver222\" are fraudulent, ficticious and unethical."
