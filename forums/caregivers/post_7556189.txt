"One of the common problems in caring for an elderly person is to prevent them from tripping. Visiting nurse sent over a \"mobility specialist\" to an elderly person I know who then proceeded to secure the rugs to the wooden floor in the apartment with scotch-tape. After some comment, she returned the next day with duct tape.Arghhh!!! The appropriate tape to use to secure rugs to a floor is what is called \"Gaffer Tape\". This is available in various colors and up to six inches in width at photographic and motion picture supply stores, as well as on the internet. This tape is used in the motion picture industry to prevent people from tripping over cables and securing material temporarily. It is very strong, durable, and designed to be able to withstand someone walking over it. Most importantly, it can be REMOVED without damaging the floor. Duct-tape, no matter the brand, will leave adhesive that cannot be removed without destroying an expensive polyurethaned floor, for example. Gaffer tape can be used to tape an extension cord to the floor that provides power to an oxygen generator or other life-saving equipment. The down side is that gaffer tape is expensive, but well worth the money. It is a good idea to replace the tape every three months or so to prevent permanant attachment of particles adhesive, nevertheless. Gaffer tape is also useful in taping heavy equipment so it cannot fall (oxygen tanks, for example), or attaching a radio to smooth surface."
