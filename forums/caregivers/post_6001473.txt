"My husband has had a colostomy for 2 1/2 years.    He now has developed sores under the appliance.    He is being treated for a staph infection in his toenails and fingernails.    All of these problems have developed in the last 2 weeks.    He is diabetic and a heavy smoker.    I have tried the stoma power and a skin barrier with no improvement.    The hospice nurse has suggested to use mylanta on the sores.    Still no improvement.    Does anyone have any idea on what to do"
