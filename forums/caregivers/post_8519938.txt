"My Mom (67) just had throat surgery Friday to remove a cancerous tumor. The surgeon removed a tonsil and a large portion of the back of her tongue. The surgery went smooth, but the recovery has not. She developed major congestion Sunday. Chest x-rays showed no pneumonia, but both lungs were partially deflated (Atelectasis). The doctor started her on antibiotics. She can't be suctioned due to the swelling and risk of bleeding. She was better Monday, but still had a bad cough. She failed a swallow test on Monday, and gets nothing by mouth except ice chips. We were told she is high risk for aspirating.They discharged her Tuesday (too soon IMO), and my daughter and I have been taking care of her. She is still on oxygen and gets continuous tube feeding (through her nose). We have been working hard with the Incentive Spirometer to strengthen her lungs, and she is walking around the house with a walker.She is still coughing and the congestion is still bad. She still cannot cough it up. At 1:00am today, she had another coughing spell. She coughed, choked, gagged, and vomited. It was globs of mucus tinged with blood. We called the ambulance and headed to the ER. The position of the feeding tube was checked, a chest x-ray looked identical to the last one on Sunday, and all the lab results were fine. We were told that the congestion caused the vomiting, and the blood came from her large, open wound in her mouth/throat. We took her back home, but now we are nervous, Her follow-up appointment with her surgeon is Monday, and that seems like an eternity now! I was hoping they would keep her at the hospital until the congestion cleared up.Would this be a situation that meets the requirements for us to get some Home Health help? We've got all the basics figured out (feeds, oxygen, hygiene, etc), but we have no idea what is an emergency (or even a concern)and what isn't. We are feeling extremely overwhelmed today. Help?"
