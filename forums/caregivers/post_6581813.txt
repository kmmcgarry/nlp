"Hi thereMy mom is 50 and suffers from a disability. My step dad is her caregiver at his own doing. I do believe he enables her a bit. She keeps bringing up the fact that if my step dad passed before her I would have to be her caregiver, my husband and I would have to uproot our lives to take care of her. Literally demanding it. I am so upset and angry at her. Its not her choice. Its my choice. Its my life. I cannot live with her. What other options would I have? Low income is a problem as well. I am in Ontario.Thanks"
