"Hello Members,I must tell you how sorry I am that I have been away from our forum for so long. Caring for my beloved father left me exhausted and losing him left me with over whelming and often consuming grief. Following his death I lost many close friends and family. It seemed never ending. And with every loss it brought back the pain of losing dad even more so.My husband and I continued our plan to winter in FL. So in addition to grieving I was busy getting our home ready to close up for the winter. Packing, cleaning and distributing many of my dad's belonging was a very huge challenge, especially as I suffer with chronic pain.Dad's been gone just six months and it seems like forever since I last hugged him. I miss him so deeply. So forgive me for saying once again to hug those you are Caregivers for..... every chance you get. Don't miss an opportunity to remind them how much you care and what a value they are and have been in your life. Make sure they know that they made a positive difference in the world and your life. It's important for them to know that they are worthy.And again don't forget to take care of you. In order to be an effective Caregiver you need to be healthy in mind, body and spirit. Thank you to all of you that are compassionate and caring enough to give of yourself and to be Caregivers.Bless you All,~Tuck"
