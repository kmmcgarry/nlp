"My elderly mother is on about 10 different drugs and she's always forgetting when to take what pills on what days. For myself, I have an app on my android tablet that keeps it all in one place and gives me warnings in case any of my drugs interact poorly. Do you think I could get my mother to use something like that? She has used my tablet before just for reading the news, and she was able to do that just fine."
