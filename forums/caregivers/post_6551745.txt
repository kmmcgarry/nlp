I work as a caretaker and have used Febreze to help control sweat odors on things that I can√¢ Ä ôt launder (chairs, pillows, shoes, etc).    It√¢ Ä ôs been a lifesaving product for my nose and the noses of my clients!    I√¢ Ä ôm working with the new Febreze SPORT collection and it works even better on sweat odor √¢ Ä ì it is specifically formulated to find and eliminate sweat odors on shoes, apparel and gear:    http://on.fb.me/FebrezeSport"
