"If a person is in hospice care, are there any profit or    non profit hospice providers whose mission it is to provide    24 hour home health aides or nursing assistants when necessary, who are MAP..    certified/qualified to give medication and are supervised by the hospice agency.    I have seen this with a veteran in california, shifts of 3 days on, 3 days off, but am now looking for one in new york."
