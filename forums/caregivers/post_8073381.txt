"my SWEET MOM has now passed and all i can say is i would not take a min from the time i had my mom in my home, they have been with me for 8 years and i helped my dad take care of my sweet mom, we did everything for her as she got bedridden 11 months ago, feed.bathe/wiped her tears and her hinney, but it was a blessing to do for the woman that gave me Birth.    I LOVE MY MOM and MISS her so much.    all i can say is get rest and eat good and walk away when you need to, but most love them every min you get for they are gone before you know it,     Mom could no longer talk before she passed but she loved us with her hands, always holding our hands ,rubbing our arms. wish i could feel her touch again."
