"I care for my terminally ill father in my home with the help of Hospice. Getting his MD to prescribe his narcotics on time and correctly is next to impossible. I don't know if it is his nurse that continually makes these errors or drags her feet but it is very frustrating. On the 23rd the Hospice RN called his office (from my home so I heard every word) to request refills and add a new liquid form of pain medication. When I went to pick this up only the new liquid medication was ordered and none of his usual refills were ordered. This is at least the fourth time this or something very similar has happened.Nothing could be done over Christmas as no one was available. So today I had to call the on-call Hospice Nurse to try and obtain a prescription that will at least cover my father till Monday. Of course his MD was not available. The on call MD refused to order anything until the on-call RN made a personal visit to our home. The on call MD would still not order my father's oxycontin but he did order the oxycodone. So now I will have to juggle his meds to try and give him coverage for the next 48 hours. These were not early refills. Every tablet is accounted for.Care-giving is challenging as it is without adding an MD that is not willing to do his part. Has this happen to anyone else? If so how have you handled it? Any suggestions?Thank You for any and all input,Tuck"
