"My dad just had surgery for a broken tibia/fibula and he can't put any weight on it for the next month.    He is supposed to come home tomorrow and we don't know how we're going to get him up the stairs to the house.    The physical therapist said he should go up on his butt.    My dad is 65 and has had both hips replaced recently and I don't think he's going to be able to do it.    I am looking for some different things we can try to get him up the steps without putting any weight on his foot.    Does anyone have any ideas?    Thank you!"
