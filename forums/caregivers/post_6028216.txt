"My mother is experiencing urinary incontinence.    She is in her mid-60s and has stage 4 emphysema.    Her incontinence used to occur only when she was having an exacerbation.    Over the past couple of years it has become daily, and she is now having accidents without realizing it.    She currently uses adult diapers, takes medicine (forget the name), and uses pads where she sits and in her bed.    She's still having frequent accidents, and our efforts to help her are hampered by her reluctance to discuss it.    I think she is also avoiding going to the bathroom because of the exertion it takes. I guess my question is, is there more we can be doing? Also, how common is it for seniors to not realize they've had an accident?"
