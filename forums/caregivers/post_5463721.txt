"http://www.caregiver.org/caregiver/jsp/home.jspThe above link has a ton of information for caregivers.    One article on how to deal with a patient with dementia was particularly helpful to me.    The organization is in California, so the social services links pertain only to that state.    This is not a web site you want to skim over.    Take your time and wander through the various articles.    You just might find something to help your own situation.    :-)"
