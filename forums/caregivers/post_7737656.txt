"My mother has lived with me for the paid 19yr and the last year she has a death wish. She wouldn't do anything for herself. About a month ago she was in the hosptial    but came home in 3 days.        I know she can't see or hear well and has a hard time walking without her walking.    The care center has sent over a wheelchair for her, so I can take her on walks.She wouldn't fix her meals like she did a few weeks ago or turn down her bed etc.    All she want to do is sit and have me do everything. I also    hand out her RX because she doesn't want to deal with it.She has help come in twice a week    and she hate's it.I don't know what more I can do. I WILL NOT    put her in a rest house.I have to add my mom is mean and bull headed and it's her way or no way.Thanks"
