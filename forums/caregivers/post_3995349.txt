"My mom is sick she has trouble walking, gets dizzy spells(mini-strokes)    and has celiacs disease (an allergy to gluten foods) I am her primary support, I drive her to the doctors when Im not working, I take her to do laundry, I help pay the bills, go grocery shopping. Yet she insists on walking to the store(with her cane) while im at work. the store is about 2 minutes driving distance, but not a safe road. She claims she goes there for the paper, but in reality she goes to get a pack of cigarettes. Ive caught her with candy (which is not gluten free) so it is like poison to her body. As mad and frustrated as I get and tell her this is no good for her, she's going to do what she wants anyway. She gets medical transportation when Im at work, she has a nurse come to the house once a month to give her a b12 shot and then a nurse comes once a week to help her clean, since I am so busy with everything, and taking care of her its hard to get things done. She's killing herself and it hurts me and drives me nuts that she doesnt seem to care about her own health, I care more than she does. she only 48 and we're close. I dont want to cut her off, but I feel like sometimes maybe I should, what should I do?"
