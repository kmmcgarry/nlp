"It's been nine months since I cared for my father. It seems like yesterday sometimes....and other times it seems like forever. The first few months following his passing I could barely come to this forum even though I have been a Caregiver all my life...my last was for my father.I just want you all to know that this forum is still active and monitored. Please feel free to post your concerns and questions.    Caregivers need all the support we can muster. You're a blessed group. :o)Blessings to All,~Tuck"
