"Hi.    I'm one of the Co-CLs over at Dysautonomia and I've been kind of struggling with issues of guilt over my relationship with my \"Mr. McDreamy.\"    Though some of the caregiver stress of taking care of me has been lifted off of him since I got home healthcare, I guess I anticipated that the home healthcare would be this total solution to him having to take on so much caregiving responsibility and well, now that reality is here ... not exactly.    We're a young couple (early 30s) and don't really have any role models as to how to balance this whole caregiver business with a healthy relationship.Can anyone here give me some ideas of ways that I can really show how much I appreciate everything he does for me, as well as the mere fact that he \"hangs in there\" through all the tough times like all-nighters at the hospital and terrifying medical emergencies and what have you?    I feel so guilty sometimes that it's not \"fair,\" and I'd like to have some perspective from other caregivers on what I can be doing to make his life better and to make our relationship better."
