"My father died this last November, he was taking care of my mother who has had a heart attack and 2 strokes.    I stepped up to the plate by moving in with my mother to take care of her....I didn't realize how hard it was going to be.....I feel like I have NO LIFE of my own now.....my question is.....how do I get other people in my immediate family to help me.....I have asked for someone to come sit with her while I run to the store, they sometimes will but act like I'm asking to much of them.....I'm sick of it.....I have not had a day or evening to myself since last November......My only sibbling (a sister) lives only a few houses down    from us and won't hardly show her face.......Our family before my dad died was one that was together all the time and now...it's all fell apart...."
