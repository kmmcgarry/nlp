"My 86 year old mother took her flexeril 3 times today, when she is supposed to take only at bed time.    She has a heart condition, and I am concerned that this could be dangerous.    She has been kind of out of it    most of the evening, but yet very easy to wake up when she doses off.    I    sent her to bed a few minutes ago.    Should I be worrying?"
