"Hi I am new to this forum. I am the wife of a man who is afflicted with HIV and Hep C.Right now he is undergoing Interfuron treatment ( 1 shot a week for 72    weeks) While under the treatment this man who is generally very kind patient and loving has become verbally abusive, very short tempered and depressed ( which I know is a side effect of the treatment) I would like some input on how to deal with this without taking it personaly At times I feel like just walking out on him ( not for good)    I love him very much and we have been through a lot together.This is the second time that he has done the treatment and we sirvived the first time. This time is longer and a stronger dose. I have known of people that have separated over this. I plan to stick it out and am just looking for others that are helping their loved ones through a treatment of any kind with similar difficulties for the caretakerAll input will be appreciatedGod bless youHelene"
