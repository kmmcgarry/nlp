"My brother is in the ICU at a major hospital, one with a good rating. He was in a bad auto wreck with multiple fracures, but no head trauma or internal injuries. He has been in the ICU for 2 1/2 weeks. He has had a few surgeries but cannot have a pelvic surgery due to lung congestion when they turn him on his side. He is on a ventilator and has chest drainage tubes. He is heavily sedated    - almost an induced coma in some way. I heard today they don't know why he is having the lung issue.    I am thinking why don't you know or who does know? The longer the pelvic fractures remain the worse. I can't help thinking about seeing if he can be moved to anothe facility, locally, with an extremely high rating. I'm no doctor but when is a second opinion/hospital relocation warranted?Thanks!"
