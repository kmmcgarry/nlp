"I'm a caregiver to my elderly parents. My mum is in remission for cancer. I have days when I feel especially moody due to certain problems at work or with friends, and would just sit in a corner and cry, I feel isolated from my friends as many of them are preoccupied with their own lives and I can't really count on them to hear me talk out my problems.Sometimes, I feel anxious when I have to socialise and eat at public places. I have shared some of my feelings with my counsellor, however, things have not gotten any better. I feel that I am beginning to lose interest in keeping touch with people other than my few close friends.As I'm the sole breadwinner, I have not approached a doctor about this as I am apprehensive about my problems affecting my employment opportunities.Just wondering if anyone else here has had to take care of both their parents alone. And if so, would you be able to share your thoughts with me about how to manage the responsibility?As my parents are much older than me, I also often feel very afraid that I may lose them."
