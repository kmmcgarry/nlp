"My 81 year old father lives with us and I am the full time caretaker. The past year has been challenging to say the least.My father has end stage lung disease and recently has experienced some mild to moderate heart failure. He has severe spinal structural issues that has resulted in back pain. He is prescribed Oxycontin and oxycodone for break through pain. He has been referred to the Hospice Program that should begin tomorrow. Apparently the only pain medication they will approve is Morphine which my father feels is a drug used to \"kill you off.\" He may actually refuse Hospice based on that fact alone.Has any one had experience with Hospice? Good or bad? Pros and cons? Any information and input would be greatly appreciated.Thank You,Tuck"
