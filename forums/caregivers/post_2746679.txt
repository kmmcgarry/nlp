"My mom who has dementia and very bad legs, she uses a walker, lives with my brother and his wife most of the time, and I go and take care of her as well when i can, she is 88 and very incontinent, we have her in adult depends and we have pads all over the couch and chair where she sits.    My question is.. does anybody know of an agency in nc that helps the elderly with care products that are free or at the very least, dont cost to much? This situation is all new to us, and we dont know where to turn for help, there must be some resources, and if anyone knows please let me know, so we can help our mom.thank you!"
