"I am 24, am experiencing Huntington√¢ Ä ôs disease symptoms.    My family is one of the few in the world who have early onset. I was a Nurse Assistant before I got sick. I made a positive, comprehensive website. It has a blog, care giving tips, ways to fight brain fog, myths, my story, my families√¢ Ä ô story, history, ways to have a positive testing experience, and ways to cope. I also put on there the poems I got published in the horizon. I have won more awards in a short period time than any other site, 35. 6 of them are International Awards.http***********"
