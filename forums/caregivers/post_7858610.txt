"My husband has had an AVM & surgery for subarachnoid hemorrhage. Now DX states: right parietal encephalomalacia with ex vacuo enlargement of the right occipital horn & prominent supratentorial ventricles suggestive of atrophy. He still understands & follows directions but that is about all. Will he ever, with time, be able to communicate more or be able to feed himself? Will he always require custodial care? Carol"
