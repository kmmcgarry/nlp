"I reduced my grandmother's dose of Seroquel from 1/2 of a 25mg tablet to 1/4 and she still has slight TD-like muscle movements of her lips/tongue and head nodding. She has been on this medication since being in the hospital 6 months ago. When I tried to discontinue, she skipped one dose, had strange thoughts, upset stomach and couldn't sleep. She also takes Dilitiazem and Lasix for BP. Is there something safer she can take to keep her calm and sleep?"
