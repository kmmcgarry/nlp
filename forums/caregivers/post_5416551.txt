"I have been taking care of someone for over a year now. I have very small hands but this person insists this is not the reason for the way I seem to not be able to do the suppository right. He is not mad about it, and sometimes I am able to make him go.Can someone please give me tips on how to insert them correctly so I can get him to go to lessen this process and relieve his bloating?"
