"I am going to get a lot of flak on this, but I have hired aides (and fired thirty-eight of them over a four year people before finding people I could trust), and started out with some \"rules of the road\". I did not permit them to have second jobs. They were paid over the minimum wage, and got two hour breaks, and paid lunches. That being said I prohibited internet. This turned into a major issue. But I straightened things out from day one. There was cable television in the room they could watch with the patient. Or even read while they sat next to her.    I did not want them spending their day e-mailing or surfing the net. They are paid to be a companion. Not to be a computer programmer.    One of the rules was than when she was awake I wanted them in view of her at all times, preferably at her side holding her hand or wrist. Not tapping on a keyboard. I mention this because I can tell you it will become an issue if you let the use of the internet get started. Just two cents worth."
