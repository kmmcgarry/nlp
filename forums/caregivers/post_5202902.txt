"I just wanted to take this moment to wish you all a very Happy Holiday.For many of us Caregivers this time will be extra challenging. I found my 81 year old stout and proud and terminally ill father in tears last night. I immediately hugged him and asked, \"What's wrong?\"    He responded, \"I'm homesick, you just wouldn't understand. It's worse at Christmas.\" I did my best to comfort him.He has me and my husband of course. But gone is his wife, parents, friends and most of his siblings. I think that is what \"Homesick\" means to my father. A longing for the way thing were and the ppl that were in his life. How very difficult it must be for all of our elderly loved ones to feel \"Homesick\" at a time when many of us are so joyous.We Caregivers have even more to do in an attempt to fill those lonely hearts during this time of the year. Hang tight to those you love and care for, especially those that are \"Homesick\". Put a little extra love in their stockings. Cook up some old favorites. Walk down memory lane and don't forget to reach out and hug them...often.And From Emily Dickinson:Death leaves Us homesick, who behind,Except that it is goneAre ignorant of its ConcernAs if it were not born.Through all their former Places, weLike Individuals goWho something lost, the seeking forIs all that's left them, now --Have a Blessed Holiday.Peace and Love to All of You,Tuck"
