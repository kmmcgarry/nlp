"As I write this it is 6AM. Suddenly I awoke at 1:30AM knowing something was not right. I quickly checked on my father. He was in his bedroom doing his nebulizer treatment that is scheduled at 6AM. I went to his side and he was confused, thought it was five after six. He was hot and was experiencing more than usual shortness of air.I took his temp, 101.4. I quickly got his Anacin and liquid oxyfast and waited for them to kick in. He refused to lay down as if by laying in bed he was giving in or giving up. So I sat next to him and let him lean against be as I held him. After an hour it was apparent that he was not improving. I called for my husband and he took my place holding dad as I called the on call Hospice RN and turned on the coffee. Of course there is nothing that Hospice can do, nothing anyone can do at this moment as I am following dad's wishes.I now have him propped on his side with pillows, the head of his bed is elevated. Between my husband and I we are at his side. I have taken a break as the tears have come, uninvited and roll down my checks. They just won't seem to stop.Daylight has come. I don't know what lies ahead for dad. It has been raining since I awoke at 1:30. It's as if the heavens are crying with me.I hope I have covered everything and I hope I am making the right choices. I once again asked dad if he wanted to go to the hospital. They may be able to slow this process or who knows maybe even reverse it for a short time. But dad has made his wishes clear on numerous times before this day and repeated them again to me this morning, \"I want to stay here.\" ...and than he added, \"If it's not to much trouble for you.\"    My Lord how could my dad be any trouble? And I assured him he was not.    And I told him for the millionth time, I love you.I will not be on MedHelp much today. If you are so inclined please say prayers of comfort.Mel's Daughter,~Tuck"
