"Having seen the toll caregiving takes on everyone, I have opened a B&B located near Denver just for caregivers to get a respite. I would encourage people in other communities who have an interest inserving the growing population of caregivers to do the same. Existing B&B's could offer discounts to caregivers or try to connect with non-profit organizations in their area to fund overnight stays for respite care."
