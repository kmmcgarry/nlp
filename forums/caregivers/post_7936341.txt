"With the super-elderly and severely disabled elderly (especially the bedridden) the structured provision of means for them    to make decisions is extremely important. If you have health care aides, this must be emphasized. As an example of this is to always offer two choices of some activity, several times a day. This takes some thought.    In senior homes, residents often dump their meals into plastic bags (not eating in the dining room) to take them to their rooms because choosing the time of day they can eat is important.(1) In the morning the patient should be offered a choice of TWO kinds of clothing. I am not a fan of leaving patients in pajamas all day long. They should be dressed in normal clothing during the daytime.(2) If they go outside a choice of hats and handbags and earings (for example). Two choices are enough.(3) With meals, offer them a choice of entrees every day. (\"would you like fish or hamburger for lunch today?\")(4) With the meals are ready ask them \"would you like to eat now or later?\" Don't just bring over a meal. You would be surprised at the self-satisfaction a bedridden patient obtains from simply controlling their meal time.(5) When going out let them choose destinations. (\"Would you like to go to the duck pond of the children's playground?\"). When outside don't just return home. Ask \"Would you like to go home now or in twenty minutes?\". Or: \"Would you like to stop at the store on the way home?\""
