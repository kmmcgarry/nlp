"When interviewing a new aide from an agency or outside hire I would ask them what they thought was the most important thing in regards to their duties. Over the years I received many answers, but never the correct one. Some girls told me \"to keep the house clean\". Others said \"to make sure Mrs.______takes her medications\". Still others said \"to make sure Mrs. eats and drinks and to call the doctor if anything happens.\" I would have to straighten them out.Your PRIMARY DUTY, I would tell them,is to try to make sure that when you come in to work, you do your everything in your power to make that this will be the very BEST and HAPPIEST day of your patient's life.I would meet with them personally every day, or if that was impossible, by telephone and we would discuss exactly how we planned to accomplish that goal."
