"It has been a long road so far with my mom, to watch her in the last 6 years go from being a strong lady and my mom to weak and not knowing who she is, she no longer acts like my mom, in fact i have become her mom.it breaks my heart to see her like she is but i know i have to be strong and take care of her , i have had the Blessings of her living in my my home for the last 7 years so i got to sit and talk and learn alot about her and her childhood, we have had many good times together and now she needs me to help her throught the rest of her life. my dad also lives here with us and hes 77, not a easy job on him . he works 3 days a week just to get away and get his head together , its good to keep working it keeps you busy and with the worldmy mom has a lot of uti and they knock her off her feet. we visit the hospital alot now. shes not walking these days because her legs just stoped working not sure why.prayers for all that goes throught this. love your family"
