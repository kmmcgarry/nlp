"My father is aged 75 years. He was having problem in walking since February, 2012 but no other abnormality was there. A neurologist was consulted, who after CT Scan of brain, diagnosed Deep White matter brain Ischemia, Cerebral Atrophy and Parkinsonsism. Syndopa 110 (half tablets thrice daily), Tremnil 2 (half tablets thrice daily)    is being administered. But the condition goes on deteriorating instead of improvement. He cannot talk,walk or think properly. These symptoms were not there in the month of February, 2012. All these symptoms have developed after the administration of drugs. Recently Somazina Plus (Citicholine 500mg + Neurocetam 800 mg) is being administered. But no appreciable improvements are noticed.Kindly advise."
