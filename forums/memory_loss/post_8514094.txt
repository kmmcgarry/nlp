"My significant other is a young male late 20's no serious medical issues. He recently had an episode where he lost complete knowledge of the world around him. Did not know who anyone was, where he was. Could not recall the month etc. He said he had a warm burning sensation in his head accompanied by a headache. After about 2 hours of going in and out of this state, he regained his full memory (but could not recall the memory lapse episode). His body showed signs of weakness up until about 8 hours after the incident. No specific side of the body, just lack of strength to stand up on his own and what seemed like motor impairment. My first thought was he had a stroke... is this possible? He did not show any signs of weakened facial muscles or an extended period of time with weakened limbs. There was no visible sign of the body experiencing any trauma immediately before the SUDDEN memory loss. Any thoughts? He does have some signs of PTSD from military past. Could this be related? He had been drinking that night but much less than usual."
