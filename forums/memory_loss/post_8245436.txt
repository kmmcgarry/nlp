"Yes just wondering if anyone has the same concern I have or know of someone who does where spoken instructions or questions are very difficult to understand or retain memory of. However verbal instructions or writing information a person who requests it (such as a doctor) is relatively unimpaired. I am following up with a neurologist and psychiatrist and the diagnosis and treatment are clinically complex. However was interested in how this can be managed on a daily basis with some pragmatic ideas or suggestions."
