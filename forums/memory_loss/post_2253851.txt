"Am taking medications for depression and anxiety, and experiencing some memoryissues coincident w/disorders or meds.    The memory problem: I can attend and event, a lecture, and the like.    Be quite focused, attentive, understanding, but afterword can remember little more than what subject matter was covered.    Too, experiences during the day, when recollected, seem discrete and unconnected - i.e., can't quite recall when such and such happened or whether it was today or yesterday.    I some- what overstate, but still it's all in all somewhat spooky. My psychiatrist has ordered an MRI brain scan and a memory workup w/a neurologist.    What might they be looking for?    I'm 70 yrs. old, no other memory problems, no other health issues."
