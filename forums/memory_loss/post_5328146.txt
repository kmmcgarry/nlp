"Every place I look it is all about Altzeimers. I do not think I have early Altzeimers. I do not know. I have been hit many times in the head. The last time was about four years ago. It felt as if my brain moved. It felt as if it slooshed into the back of my skull. Since then I have been experiencing problems with my memory and retention. More than usual. And I am now starting to have problems with remembering simple words. I will try to say something like \" where is their house?\" and will not remember the word house. It can take minutes of me stumbling and grasping through my mind before I can remember. Even though it is a common word. Can the being hit all my life & memory issues be related? Or is it because I am older (almost 40)? Or is it something else?"
