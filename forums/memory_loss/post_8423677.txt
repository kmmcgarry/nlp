Now, I have to think too much to remember even simple thinks.I recently suffered from Uninary track infection and received an infection of ceftriaxone (4 times), and some other antibiotics. The infection disappeared, but    I started feeling weak and tired right after the injection.My blood analysis revealed a sedimentation rate that was too high(+++), but the doctor did not prescribe any medicines.Other tests: HIV, Hepatitis, Diabetes were all negative.My Other symptoms include: Dry throat, dry hands and feats (But I take enough liquids) .Strange blue color appearing in small parts of my hands.Can you guys advice me what to do? What type of tests/doctor can I see for consultation?Thx,ECK."
