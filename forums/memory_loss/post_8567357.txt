"I been having some usual headaches. I have headaches that start in my forehead and moves to the center, and back of my head. I've had an MRI and everything turn out find. At times I do have problems with my sinuses but not like this. Sometimes my neck hurts along with these headaches. My headaches feels like stabbing pain, or my head is burning and itchy which I find that it is weird. Sometimes i do feel a little nausea with it. Do any one have any idea what is wrong! I have headache just about everyday."
