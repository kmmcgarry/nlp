"Hello,My mother had an incident yesterday where she lost her memory for an hour.    She doesnt remember what happened but she was walking around and scared and confused.    She knew at the time she needed to call for help and called my father but she cannot remember calling him.    An hour later my father came to pick her up and she recognized him and started to feel normal again.     What do you think caused her memory loss?"
