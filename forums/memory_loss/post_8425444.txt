"I have had memory loss for a long time now. I have gone through some trauma in my life, but I have never banged my head or been in a car accident. I have been emotionally abused and was in a bad controlling relationship 4 years ago. I am 21 years old, yet as soon as events happen I don't remember them unless I see pictures or hear someone recall a happy event. For example, they will say remember when? and then they will tell a story and I don't remember it until they explain. I don't remember my childhood. I know I don't have PTSD, but I know something is not right and I need answers. I have gone to a counselor, but no diagnosis as far as I know. I have 2 kids. They are 3 and 4 years old. I dont even remember what they looked like when they were little. I can't picture many things in my head when I close my eyes and try to remember things. Lately I have been looking at people, then close my eyes to see if I can picture what they look like but I can't. I know I don't have prosopagnosia. I have a hard time comprehending things when I read and I don't know if that has anything to do with my memory. I am a senior at a University, but I only remember my notes short term enough to take a test then I forget it all. I want to be able to recall memories of my childhood. I sit and think hard, but nothing comes to my mind. My thoughts    are always jumbled up. Everyone knows I don't have a good memory, but only my mom and I know to what degree. I am mentaly stable and live a normal life, only problem is my memory. I hope I don't sound crazy, but I hope someone on this blog can give me an idea of what the problem is."
