"My 78 year old Dad visited a neurologist who suggested we have an EEG and an MRI performed.    She listed his condition as \"memory loss and slowness in thinking\".    What will we learn from the EEG and MRI as it relates to Dad's condition?    And from whatever we learn, what are the possible treatments?She also recommended we investigate Ariceipt and Razadyne. Why reasons are there not to proceed with the med treatment without the tests?I don't understand the 'value-add' of the tests if the treatment will be the same.Thanks in advance for your perspective.I"
