"A week ago I blacked out while driving, I was not injured in the accident. But every since the black out I get very confused when I talk and I forget words, also my sight is very blurry and when I try to read I get really confused? I was in the hospital for 3 days, they did a bunch of tests but they didn't tell me anything. They just said they MRI and the echo looked OK. But I'm really starting to worry. I'm a 46 year old female."
