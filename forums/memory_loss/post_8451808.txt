"I'm a 51 year old male and have had fatigue, chronic forehead pressure, and mental fog for 30+ years. I'm otherwise in good health and exercise at least 6 days/week. I'm incredibly frustrated by this condition as it's cost me both personally and professionally.I'm highly allergic to a lot of grasses, trees, molds, etc. and have been through about 6 rounds of shots and drops since 1994 to no avail. Allergy retest each time I start a round back up have shown the same allergic response so it's apparent my body isn't building up an immunity. Also have had expensive food allergy test ($1000 skin prick and a $750 ALCAT blood test). Skin prick showed allergic response to all foods except pork and chocolate whereas the ALCAT showed intolerance to less foods. My symptoms have gotten more chronic over the last few years. I've also been to 2 neurologists, tried various antidepressants, had spinal tap, MRI's, botox injections, etc. etc. all to no avail.Note that I had sinus surgery 10 years ago and sinuses drain fine.Had a few questions:1. Do my symptoms sound like they are related to food intolerance (ie: sinus cavities) , facial nerve inflammation, or facial muscle tension?2. What clinic in the US is the best at treating environmental or food type allergies/intolerances? What about clinics for chronic pressure type symptoms and/or heachache?3. Could sinuses be the culprit even though I can breath fine and have no congestion? ie: inflamed lining that are able to drain properly."
