"My spouse was dignosed with dementia, he has uncontroled insulin-dependent diabetes with neuropathy, CIDP, dementia, reflux diease, headaches, cervical and lumbar disk diease, high blood pressure.My question, is what am I looking at with him having all these problems.    I did not know he had dementia, until they just approved him for partical disablility,    But, it explained alot of his actions.Last night, he was putting paper in the freg.    Tried to make a sandwich with 2 pieces of paper, and meat.He is 43 yrs old.    In 1998 his esphogus ruptured, which he almost died, every since that happened he has went down hill."
