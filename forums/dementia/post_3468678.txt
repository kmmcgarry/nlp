"I am a union represenative who's asking on behalf of a coworker who's father has advanced Dementia. My coworker just left his job here in California to be with his dad in Michigan. Our HR rep is a very unapproachable, biased, rude individual who gave him no advice as to what he needs to do. As of 9/30, our HR rep is going to give him his 5 day quit notice. HELP!!"
