"I am wondering if having Psuedo Tumor Cerebri could eventually cause Dementia or Ahlzeimers? I have had 2 shunts placed but, I still have problems w/ memory (short term) and massive headaches, etc...anyone out there w/ info? My Grandma died w/ Ahlzeimers so, I'm a little concerned w/ what could be going on w/ my brain. I really would like to have some feed back. Thanks so much!"
