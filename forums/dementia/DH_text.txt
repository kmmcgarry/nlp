"Hello: In September 2005 I suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke. I underwent two brain surgeries: one to clip two ruptured aneurysms and one to install a permanent shunt to remove blood and cerebro-spinal fluid from my intracranial cavity. While I have experienced some recovery in some areas, MY SHORT-TERM MEMORY and sequencing abilities are severely diminished.I have been recently tested for Vascular Dementia by neuropsychologists at the local Medial Center (UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA). The results have not yet been provided to me; however, I expect to receive a DX at the end of the month.What options (pharmaceutical or otherwise) are normally employed to treat vascular dementia? Thank You So Much! I feel that my memory is growing steadily worse and am quite worried. Any information will be appreciated.BRAIN2005"

First I went to a cardiologist who found \"Moderate Myocardial Bridging of the proximal and left antirior decending\" coronary arteries. But he did not feel it related to my memory problems.Next I went to a neurologist, I have the results of an MRI and this has to do with my question (if you could tell me in laymans terms what it means?)I also had a EEG, EMG, NCS, but don't have those results yet.Neuropsychological test said \"her memory functioning is in the borderline demented range..\"Here is the MRI report...\"A few areas of high signal can be seen in the convexity white matter.The distribution and location carry a differential diagnosis ofMinimal white matter microvascular ischemic disease or Vasculitis.Multiple sclerosis is included in the differential diagnosis, but less likely.The distribution pattern is atypical for a demyelinating disease.Contrast enhancement pattern is satisfactory. Diffusion imaging is unremarkable. The pituitary is not enlarged. The paranasal sinuses appear satisfactory.Some scattered minimal foci of hyperintense signal can be seen in the peripheralsupratentorial white matter on FLAIR axial imaging.Differential diagnosis is minimal microvascular disease versus vasculitis.

"I am looking for information on dementia and surgery. My dad needs knee replacement surgery but he was recently diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. I'm in Kathmandu, Nepal (3rd world country) and most doctors cannot tell me how it may affect my dad. Went to a neurologist and he says go ahead with knee replacement surgery since it might increase his quality of life. But he says dementia might get worse because of the stress from surgery and might be permanent but that's the risk. I don't know if the risk is worth taking. Right now, his memory has gone downhill but the most drastic thing is his speech. He cannot communicate well; has difficulty finding the right words to form a sentence. He recognizes people and the condition is still bearable. I don't want to put my dad at risk but he cannot walk because of the weakness (advanced arthritis). He is not in pain, he says. He is taking neurocetam 800mg, 3 times a day as prescribed my the neurologist but he says he might only improve a little bit. I know no one can tell me exactly what the best option is but any advise will be appreciated. Thank you...Junkirri***@****"

"Hi,I hope someone can give me an answer soon. 10/07/08 I had a Cat Scan done because I was concerned about my memory and not being a sharp as I was.It showed mild bifrontal atrophy and everything else appeared normal.    I have severe neck problems so at first I thought it had to do with various medications I am on. Saw a new Dr. for depression and my memory problems came up and he wanted to have a MRI with and w/o contrast which I did. My follow up visit had to be postponed so I got the report.    Most of it was normal, except under findings -noncontrast images reveal a few scattered areas of high signal change in the periventricular deep white matter bilaterally. Under Impression - a few scattered small vessel ischemic change foci demonstrated in the periventricular deep white matter.Does anyone know what this means in laymen terms and does it have anything to do with dementia?    I am so stressed out.    Please can someone help and try and answer this?Thanks so much"

She has been attributing the memory issues to menopause.    However, in the last couple of months, she has become more concerned about her memory, due to more episodes of \"fogginess\", forgetting names, situations etc.    This has led to increased anxiety and worry.    She is just awaiting her next appointment with her neurologist.    I have been trying to do some research regarding the link between adult onset epilepsy and dementia.    Is there a link?    Is it possible that the memory issues are being compounded by her anxiety about them, or could they be related to menopause?As you can imagine, we are very concerned, especially since she is very young to be having these kinds of symptoms."

"I'm a 30 yr old, otherwise healthy male. Over the period of the last four or so    months, I've become increasingly confused, and muddled. My short term memory has become very poor, my balance feels wobbly, and I'm getting muscle twitching pretty much everywhere constantly throughout the day.Whilst I can still type, and convey myself in text, verbally I can't think of what to say half the time, especially when posed a question, and when I do say something, it frequently comes out jumbled, or in the wrong words.To date, I've seen both a psychiatrist, and a neurologist, neither of whom thought I had a mental health or a neurological problem. As I've become more and more withdrawn socially over this time, mainly due to feeling increasingly confused and muddled, when leaving my flat, I've just been told I've got some sort of anxiety disorder going on, coupled with depression.What none of the doctors I've been to see so far, seem to have taken note of, is that I've only become withdraw since I started to feel so confused all the time, and not vice versa. Because of this, I'm a bit worried something has been missed.Currently, I don't feel like I know what I'm doing half the time, and just wandering about in a daze like, drunken state, which scares the hell out of me that I've got some sort of dementia like disease?"

"Hi All,This is my first time to post in this forum, i am lost with the health case my mother is having right now, so i'm hoping to find valuable opinions hereMy Mother is aged 64 now, she has Type II Diabetis, and had a meningioma surgery (Frontal Lobe) last May2005.The tumor extracted from that surgery was big, and it caused my mothers smell, so after surgery she had no sense of smell already.. but the good part is she returned to her \"normal self\"     e.g. she knows what she's doing, she can control her urine, and her behaviour is back to normal - unlike before she was operated where she doesn't know or is not aware of what she is doing, very evident behavioral change, and uncontrolled urine...Before she was diagnosed with meningioma she had several months of high blood sugar level, this in fact was our first theory that the long period of high blood sugar level is causing the behavioral change since she was diabetic, but later ruled out as i said because she was diagnosed with meningioma...Now, 4 years after that surgery, we are again worried for the signs we are seeing. To give a clear distinction between the case now and before with her meningioma i have breakdown our observations as follows:1. We are seeing again evident behavioral changes... The most significant is her Cognitive abilities... She can reason out properly, but she can not find or speak the word she wants to say.    She can not complete a sentence because she can not produce the word for the object/person/event that she is referring to.        The difference now from before is that before she is totally unaware of what she's doing,    unlike now she has the sense of awareness but could not speak completely due to our observation that she can not recall the word for what she is referring to (people, object, place, event)2. She can control her urine, but poorly that sometimes she urinates in her pants,    but not TOTALLY UNCONTROLLED urination as was the case before..3. She is too silent now, she doesn't tell tales or stories anymore, similar to a total loner where you will see her sitting for hours in a corner not speaking or doing anything, just sitting, even if a person is sitting in front of her she does not communicate, just silent...    - unlike before she seems to have no control of talking to anyone with any topic that comes to her mind..4. She eats normally AND she doesn't lose or gain weight...    her weight is stable at 128 lbs... - unlike before she rapidly lost weight5. She sleeps normally - unlike before she had sleeping problems...6. She has no sense of self grooming now - same as beforeWe returned her to the Neurologist that handled her before, examined her (no CT scans done). The neurologist said she can not see any signs that the Meningioma has re-occured... Her diagnosis was my mother was having a depression, so she prescribed her to take Stablon Anti-Depressant.     But after two weeks of taking Stablon, there was no expected result happening, and worst my mother began showing unawareness of what she is saying... so we immediately stopped the Stablon and informed her neurologist, which also agreed to stop the Stablon.Tomorrow we're returning my mother to the Neurologist for further examination as requested by the neurologist herself.I am now lost on my mother's case....     Based from the observations above, is this meningioma re-occuring?     Or Early stage of Dementia?     Or another Neurological disorder?Please Help me...    What should we do to get a clear definite diagnosis..."

"After having experienced progressive cognitive decline over the past ten months, coupled with all manner of random shooting pains, blurred vision, muscle twitching, movement issues, etc, I've now been told by two different neurologists in the past month, I'm suffering from some sort of pseudo dementia / severe somatisation disorder.As    previously, perfectly healthy 35 year old male, I find this very hard to accept, but have now had so many different opinions this year, all alluding to the same diagnosis, two normal MRI scans of the brain, innumerable blood tests, etc, I guess I'm just going to have to go with it.My question is, how is something like pseudo dementia treated?"

"My mother has advanced senile dementia. She is 89 and a half. She has other physical problems, but the most worrying right now is she finds it unbelievably difficult to swallow anything. Her throat, esophagus, and stomach were all examined thoroughly a few months ago (when she first mentioned she found it slightly hard to swallow) -and there was nothing physically wrong there!This is getting worse and worse. It is extremely hard to get nutrition into her. Her water has to be 'thickened' and she will be able to drink a couple of spoonfuls that way, same with soup and liquidized food. Ordinary (thin) drinks she starts drowning on. She gets about 3 teaspoons of food down her, and 2-3 teaspoons water (thickened)I just wondered -could swallowing difficulty be some symptom of advanced dementia? Has anyone ever heard of that?Otherwise, there COULD be some other issue which isn't being addressed by the medical staff. Of course it is difficult to communicate with her, to ask her exactly what she is feeling."

"My father is 93 years old.    Fell and was hospitalized.    Hospital gave him Seroquel 12.5 mg, morning and night to control his agitation and supposedly reduce his delusions and paranoia.    (He also suffers from very occasional halucinations.)    When he released home, his aggressive behavior ramped up, since he is so weak he cannot get himself out of bed which angers him.    The doctor upped the Seroquel to 25 mg at night.    He's now been this medication 1 week, and the last 4 days at 25 mg at night (plus 12.5 mg during the day).    He appears to be more confused and having more hallucinations, so it doesn't appear to be working.    On top of that, I've researched this drug and see it is contraindicated for treating people with dementia.    Essentially, what we want is a drug to give him at bed time that will help keep him calm and help him sleep so he doesn't try to climb out of his hospital bed (now in the home) causing another fall.    What would be suggested for this purpose with the least possible side effects.    Also, very occasionally he becomes agitated during the day due to some bizzare thought in his head.    When this occurs, what would be suggested for an \"as needed\" medication."

"Three years ago I had an MRI scan for persistent headache.    No cause found but \"incidental\" finding was \"marked frontal lobe atrophy\".    I was sixty then.    Neurologist examined and assessed me and said I had absolutely no dementia symptoms and that I was functioning at a high level and better than a lot of others of my age.    Told me to go away and forget it.    Recently had another MRI for twitchy arms and legs and result said \"cerebral atrophy\".    Don't know if this is the same but expressed differently.    Still no signs of dementia but don't feel quite as sharp and getting rather apathetic about things.    This could be because I am very anxious though.    Is it possible to have brain atrophy with no symptoms and not to develop any either.    I'm probably clutching at straws here because if a neurologist can't give me a prognosis I expect it's a wait and see job!"

"Hi, My father was detected with semantic demantia about a year back. He was having problems in identifying objects and spelling out the words. The MRI scan showed degradation of the brain and the neurologist confirmed semantic dementia and ruled out Alzheimers. He has been on a medication of Aricept 10 mg a day for the past 9 months along with his heart medication (ecosprin) post his bypass 4 years back. However since his neuro medication started, his condition has gone worse since earlier it was only about speech. Now his speech has gone much worse, ability to converse has gone down, and doing basic activities like shaving etc needs reminders. He has also started talking a lot to himself.Keeping these symptoms in mind, we took a second opinion and the new doctor completely stopped Aricept. He has instead precribed the following:(For morning & afternoon)1. Parkin-plus (hydrochloride tablets)2. Norwayz (Idebenone tablets 45 mg)3. Corus (Vitamins, mineals, fatty acids & amino acids)For night1. Sove IT 6.5 (Zolpidem Tartrate Extended-Release tablets)2. Folinine (Folic Acid, Methylcopalamin & Pyridoxine)3. Olimelt 5 mg (Olanzapine)The earlier symptoms like talking to himself, being always agitated etc. has gone down with these medicines. However his speech has turned slurry and made him quite inactive. If he gets up in the night, he doesnt remember to go off to sleep and keeps wandering in the house.I am confused because none of the medications is stalling the degradation. What step should I take now? Can I send you the reports to look at?Thanks for your help..."

"Hello,My father, aged 68, has been diagnosed with Senile Dementia.He was reporting minor memory losses for about an year, which we thought to be normal at this age, until last week when he had a severe headache and we took him to a Neurologist where he advised to undergo a Plain CT Scan of the Brain.The scan revealed \"Mild Generalizes Cerebral Atrophy\" with dilation of ventricles which the Neurologist said was the cause of the Senile Dementia and the headache.He has been prescribed Neuromin-M (Piracetam + Mecobalamin) once daily for 6 weeks.It's been just 4 days he's been taking Neuromin and while his conditions have improved somewhat, even though he is still feeling a constant pressure in his head (around the temples and over the eyeballs) and random headaches, but he is also constantly having weird hallucinations, like seeing pictures, sceneries, shadows of people or even full representation of people roaming around and suddenly vanishing.So I wanted to know whether hallucinations are part of Senile Dementia? Also is this curable through the medicine prescribed to him.Any advice would be immensely valuable.Thanks a lot!"

"I found out a while ago that dementia runs in my family, its in my mothers side but its normally in very old age im only 21 yet show a lot of signsIâ � �ve had a horrible memory since I was a kid. In Primary School I would be asked to get booklets off a teacher in another class I would get to the classroom and forget what I was there for. Right now I cant remember a thing from high school yet im remembering a lot from primary. Its not all long term as I forget about daily needs like hygiene or just simple tasks ive been asked to do.List of symptoms I have or may have (that are common in dementia):-There may be a lack of concern, apathy or decreased spontaneity = not sure about this one but it sounds like the same as the social withdraw one.-Speech and language abnormalities begin early with rapid progression = I would always read    and mix up simple words like with/that/where/there etc (my reading and talking skill has advanced thought as before I couldnâ � �t read a book due to attention)-Unkempt, may repeat words, some primitive reflexes which are normally absent in individuals may become obvious like grasp, suck and snout = I do forget storyâ � �s at any point in them, forget what im talking about or reading and repeat the same thing several times. Also see Twitches bellow.-Have difficulty in naming common objects or pictures = This is something that is only happening recently where I would forget the name of something-Problems with keeping personal hygiene = I would get dressed and everything in the morning and feel like im forgetting something to later on find out it was that I havenâ � �t washed that day (I would normally think im missing an item of clothing)-Might withdraw socially, be unable to emote, empathise or sympathise = My friends and I have a joke that im not human due to what im like I cant really get upset or show emotions when I should be (I do get very upset when its involving animals but that might just be due to cartoons when I was little). I do spend most of my time in my room rather than going out as well.Random problems I have:-Twitching in the neck area = have been told its due to having to much energy and no way of it releasing so it turns into the twitches.- Ive only noticed this recently but im finding it hard to realise the difference between what happened in dreams and real life (Im sure I was banned from my dentist for taking a huff and swearing at them but ive been told I never done that yet it was very vivid and the fact I remember it so well)- I sometimes have a vivid nightmare and wake up and have hut my boyfriend as if I have just kicked or punched the monster in the nightmare.Also i dont really tend to see things that arent there if anything its normal like seeing things in the dark or at the corner of your eye.If you would like to know anything more please just sayThanks"

She is on treatment for depression, asprin and a statin.I always thought Dementia was a slow progressing condition.But it appears that over the last few months the condition just seems to get that little bit worse week by week.The Dr said that sometimes there is a run of tine wee strokes and then things may plateou out for a while, however, we are a year down the line and this has not happened.I am a person that kidn of looks at worst case scenario and best case scenario and work somewhere inbetween, however, I cannot find much on what type of prognosis could occur.Any advise gratefully received"

"I have dementia that has been determined to be of neurological origin but not progressive. It can cause episodes of cognitive confusion and memory loss that can be of concern. Last night I had to change the Catapres application I am prescribed but I forgot to remove the old application until the morning which is unsafe. Sometimes I forget to keep track of when I am cooking and things like that.I applied for a home atttendant a while back but was not found to be eligible. I have discussed potential treatments with my neurologists who are following up. They agree that I should remain where I live in the community which is what I want as well. What I am asking about and even a few tips would help is some is some pragmatic ideas on how to deal with episodes of memory loss and cognitive confusion and how to prevent any errors in judgement they might cause. Thanks."

"Not too long ago my grandpa started getting night memory loss. Only at night though. Some people think it might be dementia. At night he starts moving his arms around. He even talks to himself or just talks. He already went to the doctor but they didn't know what it was."

"My 78 year old father was diagnosed with dimentia(dementia)about 5 years ago. Finding that there are good days and bad days with this disease. Last night my father was speaking with my sister in CA (we live in MI) and she was talking about her boyfriend of 25 years and my father emphatically believed that he was simply her landlord and not her boyfriend and even had trouble remembering his name. My father lives alone in a house about 40 minutes away from me.My father has always been a rational and logical person. Watching this deterioration is heart-breaking. Anyways brought this issue up and asked him what he expected me to do with this information since he is always in denial about things like this. He told me that he knows he is having a \"little\" trouble and instructed me not to do anything and that he will let me know when it is time for me to step in and help. I told him that I am worried that he may be out driving one day and forget what yield means or what a red light means and that he may injure himself or someone else. That didn't seem to phase him.Guess I am looking for advice. Don't want to forcibly put him in any home. We've toured Assisted Living facilities, and as nice as they are nowadays, in his mind they are just dressed up final resting place before death. I won't force him into any place like that unless the care he would require is beyond my ability.Thank you to all for any advice.Laurie"

"My wife has HM and is having migraine attacks 7 to 8 times each day. Sometimes these attacks cause memory loss. She can't remember what we watched on TV the night before or several days before. She sometimes doesn't people who have been around her on a daily basis. On a recent ER visit, I ask the doctor about this. He said that the memory loss is not caused by the migraine, but offered no advice on what to do. What kind of doctor does she need to see to have this checked out? need help."

"Hello. Well my grandad has had dementia for over 7 years now, and he is in a nursing home. Being a teenager it was quite difficult for me to cope at home, with the chaos between him and my grandma and mum. He started getting violent and thats when we decided enough was enough. And that he had to go in to the nursing home then because it was getting just too much. That was over 1 year ago. So anyway, instead of telling you a story, all i want to really ask is (if anyone knows...), around about how long might my grandad have till he may pass away. I mean he is now lying in a bed unable to move properly. Isnt able to walk, and sometimes is almost unresponsive (verbally). He is able to talk a bit, crackinga few jokes every now and then, but there are other times where he just stared at the wall and says nothing. How long might he have left?"

"My Mother, who is no longer with us had dementia and I saw what it did to her.    I moved her into my homeand took care of her until her doctor advised a skilled nursing home for her.    I visited her every day andit was heartbreaking to see her decline.    Now I am really concerned that I will also get it too. I have been told that walking everyday is one way to stave off this    progressive disease.    Is there anything else I can do?Your help would be very much appreciated.    Thank you.    joyanna 243"
