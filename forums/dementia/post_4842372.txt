"My mother has advanced senile dementia. She is 89 and a half. She has other physical problems, but the most worrying right now is she finds it unbelievably difficult to swallow anything. Her throat, esophagus, and stomach were all examined thoroughly a few months ago (when she first mentioned she found it slightly hard to swallow) -and there was nothing physically wrong there!This is getting worse and worse. It is extremely hard to get nutrition into her. Her water has to be 'thickened' and she will be able to drink a couple of spoonfuls that way, same with soup and liquidized food. Ordinary (thin) drinks she starts drowning on. She gets about 3 teaspoons of food down her, and 2-3 teaspoons water (thickened)I just wondered -could swallowing difficulty be some symptom of advanced dementia? Has anyone ever heard of that?Otherwise, there COULD be some other issue which isn't being addressed by the medical staff. Of course it is difficult to communicate with her, to ask her exactly what she is feeling."
