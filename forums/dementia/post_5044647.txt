"After having experienced progressive cognitive decline over the past ten months, coupled with all manner of random shooting pains, blurred vision, muscle twitching, movement issues, etc, I've now been told by two different neurologists in the past month, I'm suffering from some sort of pseudo dementia / severe somatisation disorder.As    previously, perfectly healthy 35 year old male, I find this very hard to accept, but have now had so many different opinions this year, all alluding to the same diagnosis, two normal MRI scans of the brain, innumerable blood tests, etc, I guess I'm just going to have to go with it.My question is, how is something like pseudo dementia treated?"
