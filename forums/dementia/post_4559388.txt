"I'm a 30 yr old, otherwise healthy male. Over the period of the last four or so    months, I've become increasingly confused, and muddled. My short term memory has become very poor, my balance feels wobbly, and I'm getting muscle twitching pretty much everywhere constantly throughout the day.Whilst I can still type, and convey myself in text, verbally I can't think of what to say half the time, especially when posed a question, and when I do say something, it frequently comes out jumbled, or in the wrong words.To date, I've seen both a psychiatrist, and a neurologist, neither of whom thought I had a mental health or a neurological problem. As I've become more and more withdrawn socially over this time, mainly due to feeling increasingly confused and muddled, when leaving my flat, I've just been told I've got some sort of anxiety disorder going on, coupled with depression.What none of the doctors I've been to see so far, seem to have taken note of, is that I've only become withdraw since I started to feel so confused all the time, and not vice versa. Because of this, I'm a bit worried something has been missed.Currently, I don't feel like I know what I'm doing half the time, and just wandering about in a daze like, drunken state, which scares the hell out of me that I've got some sort of dementia like disease?"
