"Hello,My father, aged 68, has been diagnosed with Senile Dementia.He was reporting minor memory losses for about an year, which we thought to be normal at this age, until last week when he had a severe headache and we took him to a Neurologist where he advised to undergo a Plain CT Scan of the Brain.The scan revealed \"Mild Generalizes Cerebral Atrophy\" with dilation of ventricles which the Neurologist said was the cause of the Senile Dementia and the headache.He has been prescribed Neuromin-M (Piracetam + Mecobalamin) once daily for 6 weeks.It's been just 4 days he's been taking Neuromin and while his conditions have improved somewhat, even though he is still feeling a constant pressure in his head (around the temples and over the eyeballs) and random headaches, but he is also constantly having weird hallucinations, like seeing pictures, sceneries, shadows of people or even full representation of people roaming around and suddenly vanishing.So I wanted to know whether hallucinations are part of Senile Dementia? Also is this curable through the medicine prescribed to him.Any advice would be immensely valuable.Thanks a lot!"
