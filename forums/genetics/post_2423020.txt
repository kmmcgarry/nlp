"Has anyone ever heard of Aplasia Cutis Congenita? Or even know of someone who has this? I am desperate    . My daughter was diagnosised with this in Jan. 2005 at the age of 15 months. She has had 2 major surgeries to correct some things but now there are some things going on with her and since ACC is so rare the doctors are not sure what is going on or what to expect in the future. Someone else in my shoes would help a great deal.Thanks in advance."
