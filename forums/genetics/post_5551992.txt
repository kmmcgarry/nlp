"I am about 12 weeks pregnant and my husband was using goo gone outside to clean gum off of a table we were fixing up for our 2 girls.    When I went outside to get something out of the car, I got 2 'pretty good' whiffs of the fumes.    Can this cause a birth defect by just inhaling this a couple of times?    I am soo worried."
