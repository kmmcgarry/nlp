"Has anyone ever heard of this or what the complications are? Myself and two of my kids have it. My daughter has odd facial features and autstic-like tendencys. My son has no facial features but has a dx of pdd-nos. I have none of it. The genetist didn't know what it means and thinks it just my be nothing. There sure my daughters problems are from genetics but can't find anything else. Thanks"
