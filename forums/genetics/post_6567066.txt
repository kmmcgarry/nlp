"There is what looks to be a scar half an inch from the right side of the center of my philtrum. It runs from the bottom of the right side of the middle of my    lip to the tip of the right side of my right nostril.    Does anybody here know what this could be.    Its barely noticeable but I'd still like to know what it could be. Is my    question clearly written."
