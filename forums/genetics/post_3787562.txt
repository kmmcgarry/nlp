"Hi, I was diagnosed with Homozygous MTHFR A1298C when I delivered my 29 weeks old baby girl, who had stopped moving and her heart rate had declined, after an emergency c-section. The Pathological exam of placenta suggested maternal thrombophilia and further tests showed that i had homozygous MTHFR mutation.Since than I have seen a Heamatologist, who thinks the mutation is not a problem as long as my homocystiene levels are normal. My physician felt that I should be an Baby asprin 81mg, but heamatologist didnt feel the need, and asked me to stop taking it as that was causing bruising on my body.1) My question is what should be the treatment protocol for preventing further loss when I try to concieve(conceive)and I get pregnant.2) What exactly does this diagnosis means and what am at risk to.3) Also while reading about the mutation online I came across articles relating this particular muation with schizophernia and diabetic nephropathy.5) Also what would be the medical implications of this mutation on my children.6) Should all the members of my family get tested and consult doctors.7) Should I get regular exam to check my homocystiene levels.Would really appreciate if all my questions could be answered.ThanksShikha"
