"I have been recently diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos-hypermobility/mild classic. It has also been verified that I have MVP and tachycardia.    I have noticed whenever I drink red wine, I will have shortness of breath, foot and calf spasms and sometimes heart palpitations.    Is this due to the MVP and if so, is it recommended to not drink any wine here after?    Is this a common occurance?    I have noticed it in the past, but now that I have an actual diagnosis of my genetic circumstances, Im wondering if it could be related."
