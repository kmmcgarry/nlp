"I have this mutation.    I recently had a venous clot in my fourth finger after beginning birth control pills again for only 7 days.    What does this mutation mean?1. Do I have to check my homocysteine levels each month?2.    Do I need to be careful when sitting for long periods of time, i.e., long flights?3.    If I change my diet by adding more B vitamins and folate, will it change the mutation?I need some clear answers.    My doctor said it is nothing to worry about.    My finger still hurts.Thank you.Nantea"
