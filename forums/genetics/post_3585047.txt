"my daughter is pregnant at 27 weeks and her baby is    boy. We have been to several doctors and they say they can not do anything else for him. He is not making fluid and he has alot of cyst on and around his kidneys.His heart is 157 beats and he moves around alot. Is there anything we can do for this baby? My daughter is 19 and this is her first baby. She doesn't do any drugs and doesn't drink. She has done everything right. I don't understand this. Is there anyone out there that can tell us something else to do?"
