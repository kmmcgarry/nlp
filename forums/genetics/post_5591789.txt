"i am 29 and was told during my first pregnancy at 18 that i carry the extra 21 gene known to cause down's syndrome and my chances were 1 in 10 ,however in both my pregnacies nothing happened and i had two healthy girls.I now wish to try for another baby and was wondering if my chances of my newborn being down's syndrome would have increased.we traced the translocation back 5 generations with no one in the family having down's we just all carry the gene.please help thanks"
