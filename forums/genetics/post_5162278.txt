"I am 29 years old and have had several echos... I have aortic valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve regurgitation and mitral valve regurgitation. I also have a dilated aortic root. Other things to note is i am 5'7\", 100 lbs, very tiny wrists, very flexible, high mouth palette, nearsighted (since elementary school), migraines, and always cold.I had the marfan genetic blood test and it came back negative. We know there are other connective tissue disorders out there... marfan is the only one i have tested for. My cardiologist is at this point assuming i have a connective tissue disease and is not really further into a diagnosis as he says there are many many diseases out there. Is there any benefit to going to a genetic doctor and getting a proper diagnosis? If he is treating me like I have one already and watching for whatever it may cause cardiovascularly is that sufficient?The only thing that makes me want a diagnosis is that I have 2 daughters and wish to know the odds that I have passed on this issue to one of them.Thanks in advance!"
