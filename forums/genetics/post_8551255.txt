"Maybe this question may sound vague, in comparison to the life changing questions that other people post. I am still curious about the answer. :)Im pregnant with a boy. My husband has green eyes, so do ALL of his 5 siblings. NOT their mom. Just the dad. His dad's mom does'nt have green eyes. Three of his siblings have kids and NONE of them have green eyes.What are the odds that my baby has green eyes?? :D"
