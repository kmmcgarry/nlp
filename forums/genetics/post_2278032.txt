"I have 5 healthy children (last one in 2005 and by my second husband , the others being by my first) but have since suffered 3 consecutive miscarriages in a year(last one 9 months ago) Iam pregnant again and have not yet had a scan (the others losses never got off the ground having never a heartbeat and were lost at 12,8 and 5 wks in that order) I am very nauseous but was also with the first loss. I am worried that with so many losses it means my eggs are all damaged and old and that even if this one went to term it would be severly disabled . I know most things can be tested for but hate that the tests are so late in the pregnancy. I am considering a termination becuase i could not terminate as late as the test allows(cvs is not used in my country)(I am only pregnant by accident thois time as we had given up) and as I am so worried about the state of the eggs . Please could you tell me if the 3 consecutive losses mean that the chance of malformation is huge this time if i do not lose it so i can make an informed decision Also do the tests rule out or confirm all problems"
