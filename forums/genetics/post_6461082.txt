"Hi. Quite some time ago I caught part of an item on TV that was discussing the genetics of hairless/virtually hairless people, as though this indicates some health condition. I've tried searching online to find out about this, but have found nothing; so I was wondering whether an expert could give me some information, such as whether this has a name.I'm asking because I have a virtually hairless body - my legs are smooth, plus I have scant hair in the armpits and pubes (though plenty on my head/brows). I've always been this way. I am late 40s female white.I have several chronic health conditions acquired since my 30s; including early-onset osteoarthritis of the sacral spine and other joints, plus digestive issues.Thank you."
