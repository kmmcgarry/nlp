"My OB told me there was a prenatal out called Neevo that would help prevent birth defects and miscarriages.    She said it is the metabolized form of folic acid and it doesn't matter if you have the MTHFR gene or the A1298C mutations or both.    It will bypass these.    She said it is new and everyone should take it that has a family history of this or has had these problems before.    Have you heard of this?    I wanted to share in hopes to help others because I saw a question posted about this, but this prenatal therapy wasn't mentioned."
