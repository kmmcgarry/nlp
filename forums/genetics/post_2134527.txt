"[cross posted to Teen Health]I have a school project, and we could choose from a very large amount of topics, and then get fairly creative with the project. Anyway, here is the question. I have done some research, and it seems that a person's (male) height, weight, penis size, testes size, definition of facial features, along with many other \"manly\" features are dependent not only on genetics, but levels of testosterone. SO, my theory was that even if a teenager is developing \"normally\" if they took testosterone supplements then all of the above listed \"features\" could be increased, such as height -- as long as bone plates have yet to fuse, penis size, male sex drive, etc, etc. Have any studies been done to support said theory? If not, would this hypothetically be at all feasible? Thanks for the information!"
