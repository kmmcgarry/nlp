"Whenever I eat food that is high in copper (sesame & sesame paste, mushrooms, soy milk and all other soy products, nuts, shelfish, legumes, whole grains, chocolates) within 30 minutes I experience headache, depression and confusion. Even small amounts makes problems. I'm 26 yrs old. I need several days of not eating those foods to feel better and I take zinc supplements to help me as well. But I'm ok as long as I avoid copper.My mother experiences the same symptoms so I guess it's genetic. I haven't done any tests except for liver function and it was normal. But I will do tests in the future... Is it possible that I have Wilson's disease?"
