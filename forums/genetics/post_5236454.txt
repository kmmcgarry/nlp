"I was recently diagnoised with MTHFR I got it from both parents and they say i have the A one.    I'm not sure what the compound is and my doctor isn't familiar with it and says she doesn't believe i need to take the blood thinning shots when i become pregnant but from what i read i do.    can you explain this to me a little?AngelaThis discussion is related tocompound heterozygous MTHFR question."
