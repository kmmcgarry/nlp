"My father was tested positive for HHC.    He has one copy of the C282Y mutation and one copy of H63D.    In turn, my sister and I were both tested.    We are both positive for only one copy of the H63D and our iron count is normal.    So I guess that means we are carriers.    My doctor said there is no need to change my diet and that I don't have to worry other than getting my wife tested so we would know if our offspring is at risk.    My sister's doctor said she needs to cut out iron rich foods and get her blood tested annually.    Which doctor is more correct?"
