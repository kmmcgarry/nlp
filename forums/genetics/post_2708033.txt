"Have any of you ever heard of Nail Patella Syndrome? I have not been tested to see if that's what I have, but all the signs point to it. What do you know of it?I come from a family of 8 and 4 of us appear to have NPS. We all have the thumbnails and knees. Some of my brothers also have elbow and shoulder problems. I recently underwent back surgery due to congenital spondiolytheses.Out of 4 children, 2 of mine appear to have it. My daughter has 2 sons who also have it. My youngest grandson, who's 3, was born with a severely twisted foot and after many serial castings had surgery at 10 mo. to correct it. We were told that he has Nail Patella.I do have an appointment to get tested by a genetisist scheduled for August.Just wondering what you may know of this syndrome."
