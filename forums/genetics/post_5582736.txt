"I was just wondering if you got a amniocentesis when you were pregnant if williams syndrome or any in that nature would have come up...I had a very complicated pregnancy since my baby was so small, and they did a fish test and amnio but now she is considered short stature and very small but very healthy and hits all milestones on time.that pediatrician said something about a couple syndromes and i told him about the amnio. So i was wondering if it came back normal then could she still have a sydrome? Thank you"
