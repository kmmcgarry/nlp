"At 18 weeks pregnant my maternal fetal medicine doctor told me he    was pretty positive I was having a girl!!! And At 22 weeks he confirmed it.....Well now at 28 weeks he says the clitoris looks slightly enlarged and isnt too confident saying boy/girl!!!! But also told me to not return my pink stuff....SO WTH???"
