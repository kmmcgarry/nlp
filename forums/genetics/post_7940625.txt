"My friend has a child now aged 6 that has always had behaviour problems amongst others, she is over exited, always moving and cant sit still, shakes when grins and smiles and hands clenched in the air ,can be very hard to control and more, doctors say she is a misbehaved naughty girl this is not true, i am 100% she has some genetic defect or lacking Chromosome type thing of some kind that makes her this abnormal way, i have also seen another girl slightly older when at work who looked exactly the same apart from the age, hair, color and weight , even shared the exact same mannerisms, as i a stranger walked up to her this unknown girl lifted hands clenched whilst shaking all over and said \"hello\"    as i was passing, it was a unique experience and thinking back i wish i had approached who she was with, it was so alike my friends girl it was more than just similarities, they shared some common link. I really need help with the diagnosis for my friend and her child's sake who is forever struggling in school, not with intelligence as such atm but more from attention and somewhat over excitement or misbehaviour and being able to sit still, even in a crowded room for instance at school she will jump up when all others are sitting down and wave with huge grin and mass amounts of energy. Having trouble finding where to ask for help but know this child is different whether some form of syndrome etc but not getting any help with local doctor. Anything would be greatly appreciated as to where to go next or who to find that can help.Many thanksKryo"
