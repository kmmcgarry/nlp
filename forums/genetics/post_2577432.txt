"What are the benefits vs. downfall to genetic testing. Three of the six sisters in my family have breast cancer. One just passed away. The other two were both diagnosed with stage I. The clinics do not seem interested in testing you unless you are positive for the cancer. The one sister with cancer wants her ovaries removed-but the surgeon won't remove them without genetic testing. This does not make sense because cancer is cancer. Why let the ugly disease spread? So, the other three of us without cancer get to sit and wait in limbo until we get a positive mamogram(mammogram). Is this right-or should we be seeking other surgeons, or will the outcome be the same. I am not asking for surgery-but I also do not want to die of cancer. Any suggestions at this point would be helpful!"
