"I am 75 and have been diagnosed with inherited peripheral neuropathy which basically affects my walking and balance - difficulty with stairs. Problem has been worsening over the past three years. I have tried physical therapy but that doesn't seem to help. Fortunately I have no pain or numbness, but my leg strength is getting weaker. Are the herbal products that I read about really worth trying ?This discussion is related toRare hereditary neuropathy."
