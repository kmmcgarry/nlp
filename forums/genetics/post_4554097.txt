"Is there a chance I have vascular ehlers danlos syndrome?I have very elastic skin. If I sit for more than 5-10 mins, my knees feel loose and unsteady, I have to shake my knees about to jiggle them into place, then they make a popping sound. If I dont go this, and flex my knees, they crunch and pop.When I get stresssed, I get little red spots under the skin, particularly on the inside of my arms, that doesn't fade when a glass is pressed.I also have spidery purple blood vessels visible on the tops of my shoulders.The pics show the elasticity and flexibility: http://picasaweb.google.com/JonnyFear/IMAStarfish?authkey=Gv1sRgCMLc9-rT9svcrwE&feat=directlinkI am particularly worried because of the blood vessel things, I don't want vascular EDS."
