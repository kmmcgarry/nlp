"My wife and I recently lost our unborn son who had a diaphragmatic hernia. He was stillborn at 5 1/2 months normal external anatomy after a battery of tests on my wife (none genetic) the doctors said it just happened and there is no reason why we can't have a healthy child.Anyway 6 months after it happened my wife told me we were pregnant again. Last week at the ultrasound we got the news we are having twins one boy and one girl so fraternal twins. They did a    more detailed scan than last time and said they didn't see anything wrong or anything resembling the defect our son had.We decided to order the triple screen test along with the blood work the doctor ordered. Our next ultrasound is in about two weeks. Our new doctor who specializes in \"high risk\" said don't worry things will be fine the biggest risk is premature delivery and it is very low chance things will go bad. We have no family history of genetic problems.Questions-Is the 4 1/2 month ultrasound at all reliable in diagnosing problems? (they identified 4 chamber heart, kidneys, bladders, spines, brain....) it was a normal ultrasound minus the fact it was twins.-If the next ultrasound is okay and the triple screen test is okay does that mean we are probably gonna have healthy children?"
