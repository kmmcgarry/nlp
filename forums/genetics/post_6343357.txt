"I am a 30 year old woman with regurgitation in my aortic, tricuspid and mitral heart valves as well as a aortic dilation. It is thought that I have some sort of connective tissue disease, but I have never gone in for a formal diagnosis.My question, in regards to this issue what problems occur with after-surgery healing... This past Thursday I underwent a gum graft procedure and all went fine but a few days after I had a occurrence of non-stop bleeding and had to go back in to get more stitches, the next day I had more persistent bleeding in a different area and had to go back in for more stitches. My peridontist says he has never encountered this problem with a patient and doesn't know why it has happened to me. Especially since it was a few days after the procedure and therefore I was already clotted and healing. We are wondering if it is tied to the connective tissue issues. I am now wondering if I should have gone in for a proper diagnosis so I would know all these issues that could arise.Would a connective tissue disease affect this sort of healing? Is there something I can take/supplement to assist my body? My Peridontist was talking about taking vitamin K as it helps the body with clotting (not sure if i need to talk to my cardiologist about it, but i think it may already be in the multi-viatmin i take anyway)."
