"Hi, my daughter has mild turners syndrome and was diagnosed at an early age. Now she is 33 yrs old and her last blood results revealed that she has an overload of iron. Possibly because having no periods. They want to check her oxygen levels at nite. Is this a serious concerned? And everytime she goes to a specialist, they say oh yur doin fine....?             Thank you for your time        Michael Wood"
