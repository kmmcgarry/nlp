"I'm dating my first cousin once removed and would like to know if there's any risk of serious disease for our future children since we're planning to get married. Genetically I think our case is quite different from the typical 'cousin marriage'. My grandmother married twice. my girlfriend    descends from the first marriage, I from the second. So basically, my grandmother was her great-grandmother, my grandfather was nothing to her. Thanks for your help."
