"Ok here's how it goes. I would consider myself a person with gender identity disorder.    But in researching that I have come to numerous questions about my birth.My parents, as far as I can remember have never talked to me about my birth. There are some pieces to the puzzle here that I call to question, my name was never put on my birth certificate,    and (until I had to get my permit for driving), I heard my sister talking to my mother about my birth awhile ago and she said that \"the doctor didn't know what I was at first\"....I also have always, like the typical people with gender identity disorder always felt more like a boy....since forever.Is it possible that I had some early genital ambiguity and that it was fixed and I wasn't told about it?What makes me question that is that I have never (to my knowledge) received hormone treatment, and I have a normal period in as far as it comes relatively monthly, its hard to say if it skips months because its not all that consistent in that I can't judge when it comes(not that I've really payed a lot of attention to it, with my disorder I prefer to think of it as little as possible).    And it is usually extremely painful, I'm not talking about normal cramps these things leave me writhing and I become nauseous, and sometimes my hands and legs become numb, and no its not because I hyperventilate from the pain, that's what the school nurse thought when I was in high school. I am not sexually active either. And I have gone in about that but I did some blood tests and there was really no conclusion other than take ibuprofen, which I take a lot of and that usually stops them, if I take them in time..is it reasonable to question this? Or am I just searching for other reasons why I think the way I do"
