"i have read through various things on websites and i had a hunch i had EDS, i have backBack pain - lowBack pain.Neck pain, i can sometimes feel my neck pulse.Joint pain, dislocating joints, dizzynessand flexability in my joints as well as stretchy skin, i never went to a doctor because i knew i had EDS but i just grew up with it not knowing that what im going through is normal and then i learnt how serious it was! i've asked but none of my doctors have a clue, what else is there to watch out for and how dangerous can EDS be? plus i live up in northern scotland, does any doctor know about this that doesnt live thousands of miles away? i want to know how bad it is!"
