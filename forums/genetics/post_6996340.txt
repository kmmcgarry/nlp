"I am 26 years and pregnant with my 3rd child. I had no complications during my other pregnancies. When I went to the doctor for my screening ultrasound (18 weeks) and they found 2 choroid plexus cysts on each side of my sons brain. They suggested I go to a maternal fetal medicine doctor just to get it checked out. Told me that usually everything is fine and that its just a precaution because everything else looked fine. When I had my ultrasound at the specialist 2 days later they only located 1 CPC. (this one was small). After it was done the doctor informed me they found a couple things to be concerned about. "
