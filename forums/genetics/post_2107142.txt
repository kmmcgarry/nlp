"My sister, age 53 has been found to have MEN1 syndrome, do I (age 51) need to be tested?    Do my children and grandchildren need to be tested???    What should I look for in myself???    If I don't have it can my children still be positive for it????    Also, neither of our parents displayed any problems associated with MEN1.    Please help"
