"HiI'm trying to stay up to date on my genetic disorders.... I was diagnosed with Reactive Arthritis in 2004.    The blood work showed me to be HLA-B27 and ANA +    Then, after some pregnancy complications, blood testing showed me to have MTHFR    and     1 copy of a factor V mutation.    I've never had blood clotting (took blood thinners before my last pregancy c-section) and only a few minor flares of the reactive arthritis.So, the day to day is that I take baby asprin to avoid possible blood clotting.    I'm wondering if it's common to have this many genetic issues (though thankfully none are difficult to deal with currently) and/or if there is any relation between them?"
