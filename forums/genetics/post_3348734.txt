"Hello !I want to know how our genes limits and define our growth, I mean, how the osteoblastos knows that they must stop or continue, how our cells knows when to stop growing or dividing, etc.Every human has a unique \"morphology\", the bones and skull has their own and particulary morphology, but their are created by individual cells, which are very similar between differents humans, therefore, why we have so many differents anatomy? who is (and how) controlling the work of this cells (like osteoblastos).Thanks !!!EnriquePS: sorry for my bad english, I hope you understand my question anyway =("
