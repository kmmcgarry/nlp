"My wife has suffered with sever IBS reaction to Dairy, Egg and pork for many years.    She is now 11 weeks pregnant with our child.    I have never suffered with the reactions my wife has to these food groups.    Will my wife be able to eat these foods now without having the sever IBS reaction, due to the presence of the baby and mix of our DNA?"
