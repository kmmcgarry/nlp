SO, my theory was that even if a teenager is developing \"normally\" if they took testosterone supplements then all of the above listed \"features\" could be increased, such as height -- as long as bone plates have yet to fuse, penis size, male sex drive, etc, etc. Have any studies been done to support said theory?

I will give you a run down as to what is going on with me. 5 years ago, I began to experience breathing issues, specifically shortness of breath with exertion. After tests were performed, specifically PFT's (low MIP, MEP MVV which indicated neuro muscular problem) , an EMG (was unremarkable then, but as years have gone by, they are abnormal...myopathy patter?), diaphragmatic fluroscopy (very abnormal...little mov't bilaterally) and several labs as well. I went from being placed on oxygen to oxygen and bipap to being ventilated full time 3 years ago due to chronic respiratory failure. I do have some muscular issues...my upper body is much weaker than my lower at this time, I can do stairs (after w orking with my legs extensively) but with difficulty. Some doctors have noted temporal atrophy as well.I have had genetic testing for myotonic myopathy..negative, have had muscle biopsies...non diagnostic. I do have other respiratory issues, mild bronchiectasis with heavy bacterial growth (most noteably b. cepacia, s. aureus and the like), digestive problems (pancreatic insufficiency) and DM type II. The docs did do a genetic profile for CF, from what I read is that I have one copy of M470V and 7T/11TG...(I just read that the other day in her office...there has been so much confusion with this), I also had sweat testing which were 48 and 50 respectively (docs also say that my chloride was higher than my sodium...reverse of what normal people are). I am treated as \"clinical\"    CF with chest physio, nebs and enzymes.It is because of these sweat test results, pancreatic insufficiency, neur issues (mainly diaphragmatic failure) that some docs question whether a channelopathy is at play..?    Perhaps chloride?? I guess that is what I am asking you..I have been wracking my brains, researching this stuff and not coming up with much. I am also guessing this is because it is a realitively new field that is finally being explored    with more channelpathies being discovered.I just want to tie this together somehow...clearly something isn't right here. I was 32 years old when I had to be placed on a vent full time and docs still don't understand exactly what happened...I have even been called crazy, muchausen's (yeah, I must be really good at faking ABG's and the like...!!) because docs simply don't understand.

I have multiple on each ear.Here is a list of descriptions, and hints, not all may be related to this.Preauricular tagsDouble jointed fingers and kneesApparently high rate of miscarriage or still born due to problems with heart and lungs (anecdotal from my mother)Migraines during youthAsthmaSevere allergies and/or sinus problemsNo mental retardation (some people have said I was the smartest person they knew, but I'm in the South, so take it with a grain of salt).Deformed teeth (my canines have grown out higher up and look like fangs, one dentist had said I had too many teeth, and the space behind them looks like a missing tooth).I think that's it, some of those may not be related to the disorder. If anyone can figure out what this \"Ear tag syndrome\" my mother was referring to could be, or even a web resource that may allow me to research it, I'd appreciate it."

I have had one termination, one miscarriage and a live birth in August 2007.I am now 19 weeks pregnant.I had my ultrasound yesterday and this is what the report said:A single live foetus in cephalic presentation. Liquor volume is within normal limits and the placenta is anterior and clear of the internal cervical os. Bilateral small choroid plexus cysts are demonstrated. A isolated intracardiac echogenic focus is also present in the left ventricle. No morphologic abnormality is demonstrated. No Morphologic abnormality has been shown. Measurements are as follows:BPD: 45mmCH: 162mmAC: 142mmHL: 28mmFL: 29mmHeart Rate: 139bpmNasal bone: 6mmCerebellum: 19mmCisternamagna: 3mmNuchal Thickness: 3mmThe chord has three vessels.Conclusion:Measurements are appropriate for gestational age of 18weeks 6days. EDD 7/8/08.Choroid plexus cysts and echogenic intracardiac focus may be associated with chromosomal anomaly. Background risk for aneuploidy based on maternal age would be low and it remains low despite these findings.    The nasal bone is also noted to be of normal length.    This also reduces the lilelihood of chromosomal anomaly specifically down syndrome.    No nuchal translecency assessment is available.

This was tossed out from left field as we were in the doctor for something totally not related.I asked what it was and she said, I really cant tell you, but my partner thinks its a possibility given my son's short stature and weight.    I said \"short stature\"? He is 4 feet tall and he is only 4 years old.    He also weighs 87lbs.    I    have done some reading about it and there might be some similarities which I always thought were behavior issues that we needed to address, till Prader-Willi was told to me.    My son is scheduled to have testing for this done on April 30.    I was hoping maybe you can shed some light on this subject for me and possibly tell me what I need to be asking the person coming to take the blood, and if they have a counselor what kinds of questions should I be asking them.     I refuse to believe that my son has this disorder till he is tested.    Thanking you kindly in advance."

Thankfully they are around my torso area, and at the tops of my legs, so are easy to cover up. Anyway, I was searching the Internet for possible options to have these marks removed, and came across the topic of Neurofibromatosis. I was horrified to discover, I seem to fit the bill.As well as the birthmarks, my posture has never been fantastic - more so since my teens, to the point where I'm convinced I have bow-legs - another symptom. I also have failing eyesight, although since everyone in my family needs glasses, this might well be a coincidence.I'm not here for any kind of reassurance - I know only a Doctor could confirm if I had the condition or not. I'd just like to know if the occurance of several cafe-au-lait birthmarks (I probably have around 20) is highly possible without some element of the disease?Thankfully I have none of the external lumps as described the sites, although I do have a small lump on my head which I saw the doctor about when it appeared around 13 years ago. He said it was cartilidge, and nothing to worry about, but I can't help but think this another element to the sum!My Mum doesn't have the condition, but since I've never met my Dad, I wouldn't know about him.When I was a baby, I had extensive testing for Hydrocephalus, due to an enlarged head. What is the likelyhood that anything else would have been tested for then?I hate the idea that I might pass this condition onto future children, and they end up with a far worse case than I do.Any advice much appreciated."

A condom which did not break, slip off, or appear to be damaged in anyway upon inspection (before insertion and after withdrawal). I withdrew immedialty upon if not during ejaculation into the condom. While the sex I had was protected during penetration it is possible that bare penis rubbed against vulva prior to penetration and that pre-ejaculate might have been deposited there. I suppose it's possible that the pre-ejacualate found it's way into her or that somehow sperm leaked out of the base of the condom. What are the chances? I think both those scenarios are unlikely.She had unprotected (withdrawal method with her intoxicated ex-boyfriend) sex on December 31st. Due date is expected to be 9/18/08 (she was 14 weeks pregnant on 3/20 or 3/21), so the baby is either his or mine and given the scenario probably his. While I understand it's possible that the baby is mine, I believe it is unliklely given the scenario described above. We must wait until the baby arrives, ~6 months, to prove paternity for certain. I'm driving myself crazy with worry in the meantime. Don't know how I can last 6 months of this.I simply don't know the probabilites. I would very much appreciate a physician's opinion (hopeful that it will give me peace of mind) on how much I should worry. Is this a 1 in 100, 1 in 5, 1 in 1,000 scenario that it's mine?

Never have I heard of MS being connected to PCOS but he had stated that in some cases women with PCOS, who eventually conceive and give birth, have an elevated chance of having a child with MS. Is there truth to this? I have searched all over the web and cannot find any concrete evidence.Since this was brought to my attention I have another concern regarding PCOS and MS. My mother was diagnosed with MS over 20 years ago and exhibited minimal signs of having the disease. In the past 15 years she has had no symptoms as well, without taking any medication. Do you think this connection I have with MS would have anything to do with my PCOS?Truly,KB"	"0"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

The one sister with cancer wants her ovaries removed-but the surgeon won't remove them without genetic testing. This does not make sense because cancer is cancer. Why let the ugly disease spread? So, the other three of us without cancer get to sit and wait in limbo until we get a positive mamogram(mammogram). Is this right-or should we be seeking other surgeons, or will the outcome be the same. I am not asking for surgery-but I also do not want to die of cancer.

They are taking all the necessary precautions with this pregnancy because I have a weak cervix. So everyday of carrying my child in my womb is such a blessing. At 16 weeks I got the triple quad screen down and all was negative/normal. Yet, today I was informed that the baby had a little spot on its heart that could be a marker for downs. He said it is very common in fetuses. My doc said not to worry being that my results came back fine but with all that I have been through with my previous pregnancy everything worrys me. Can any moms tell me your thoughts on the situation? I am in tears just typing this to you guys. I just been throught so much already. I know that the Lord won't give me more than I can handle.

Although she had had hundreds of basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck removed during her lifetime, she had no prior history of melanoma. I also have a history, much more mild than she, of basal cell carcinoma incidence. And I have another relative, my mother's brother, who also had over a hundred basal cell CAs during his lifetime and had radically mutating surgery as a result, just as my mother did.    Both lost noses, eyelids, and the external apparatus of their ears.    I am very anxious about the possibility that I may carry a genetic mutation that would predispose me to the same fate, and potentially early death, as my mother suffered.

I love her very much.    She has (and I have as well) put on a few pounds in the past 2 years.    We are currently working on it and the results are looking promising.    For the most part we aren't \"fat\" people.    I am about 6'2 and weigh 180.    No problem there. Just need to put the work in to get the results I want.    My wife is about 5'7-8 and weighs about 138.    She is overall a skinny girl.    Her stomach bothers her the most as it seems her body is predisposed to store fat there.    She is working on it and has done a great job eating well, watching her calorie intake, and working out almost every day.    She has lost about 6 pounds in 2 weeks.Then the bombshell...Turns out my wife has been a lot bigger in the stomach department her whole life... She has been \"sucking it in\" the whole time I have known her (yes the whole time) and what she says since she turned 14 or so.     It looks like how she describes it as looking 3 months pregnant.    Im proud of my wife for telling me this as she hasnt told anyone before ever.    It took a lot of guts.    Needless to say I was a little shocked.    It really does look like she is 3 months pregnant when she doesnt suck in.    Im a little worried medically about her.    I felt her stomach and it seems a little \"hard\" to me.    Shouldn't fat be soft for the most part?    I know mine is.Reason for me thinking its genetics is that her parents are a little on the heavy side.    Her father is a overall skinny guy.    Skinny chest, arms, and legs.    But a fat stomach.    Her mother is obese.    My wife is skinny pretty much everywhere else on her body except her stomach which seems overly big.    She says that it first started when she was about 14 or so.    Here was this little blond twig of a girl with a little mound tummy.    She has been ashamed of it forever.     We are trying to have kids soon and she doesn't want to lose too much weight as it might be unhealthy.My question is has anyone ever heard of anything like this?    Im worried as I think she might have something wrong with her hormones or something.    Her brother has a conditon called Congental Adrenal Hypoplasia(spelling).    His body cant produce the right amount of hormones and such.    Does my wife have something similiar?

Not that I didn't try. (he doesn't even aknowledges my hypermobility, which I have an official diagnosis for!).My physiologist is the one who gave me the hypermobility diagnosis. ...Well in fact he is more stuck on the \"ligamenteous hyperlaxity\", but doesn't flinch when I use \"hypermobility\" and sometimes uses it himself. But never on paper. I'm officially \"hyperlax\".I asked him, sounding simply curious (these creatures are easily scared!) if \"I couldn't have EDS type III, you know, the hypermobility one?\"... At first he looked like he didn't quite know what I was talking about, then said he didn't know much about it, and finally agreed it was \"possible\". Wow! But he said something like \"but I think theres no way of diagnosing it officially, and what good would it do you to have that diagnosis?\" Since I didn't want to push it and it was obvious he didn't want anything to do with that, I simply agreed (and it is true indeed, I won't get any treatment with a diagnosis... simply better recognition and maybe some help, but doctors don't care about that and it's hard to explain... In his mind I already have a name to put on my problem, so why care?).If there could be a test done by a genetician, I would ask for a genetician consultation the next time I see my GP.

I was 18 weeks pregnant had a triple screen test and it came back that I was at high risk of carrying a baby with down syndrome. I went to a specialist to find out what I was having and to also get further testing with the triple screen results. With the ultra sound, they found a large hygroma on the back of the baby's neck, and SHE also had hydrops. I allowed them to do an amnio and it comfirmed Turner Syndrom(syndrome). I was told from that point that I would lose the baby. I was sent home and told that if she stopped moving, to get to my doctor right away, and if she continued to move for the next two weeks, they would have me back to check her heart. With that being said, I was so dissatisfied with the care I was given, I went to another doctor which gave me another untrasound, and showed the hygroma was now even larger and she was filled with fluid.    Her heart showed that she had Hypo plastic left heart syndrome, meaning the left side of her heart was smaller than the right, and I was told she was in conjestive heart failure and her heart would eventually stop.    They were surprised that she hung on for as long as she did, but I carried her till I was 22 weeks, then I had to be induced and gave birth.    She weighed 2lbs and was 11 inches long.    Almost 1/2 of her weight was fluid, and it was a very hard to have to see her in such a condition.    But we were able to spend time with her, have a proper burial and so forth, which helped some.    I'ts    still to understand why something like this had to happen.    I have a four year old daughter that I had in previous relationship, which she is fine, and I never saw this coming.    I'm not sure if the worry will ever go away, but you need to try and focus on the positives in your life and go from there day by day.    I'm now trying to get pregnant again, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm so scared something like this will happen again.    But I try and remember that god won't give you more than you can handle.    I don't know if this is true, but I sure do try to believe it.

The first pregnancy which was with a little boy we named Zane, at 19 weeks, we found out that he had a sever brain disease known as semi-lobar holoprosensephly. This means that he was born without the front part of his brain. Our doctors said that more than likely he would die within the first 30 hours of his life and that if he got the slim chance to live, he would be a vegetable for the rest of his life, completely reliant on tubes with no emotion or sense of anything. He was blind and deaf as well. We were advised to abort the pregnancy due to everything that was wrong not to mention the complications that it would cause with me. With the second pregnancy,    at 18 weeks, we went to our specialist to make sure that what happened last time, didn't happen again. We discovered that it had not, but that something else had went wrong, the baby had no heartbeat. We had went to my regular doctor's on July 2nd and everything was fine. By July 9th when we went to the specialist, he had died. We named him Sylar. When I delivered him, his cord was wrapped around his body and neck. Currently, this is the known cause of death but because of what happened previously and then this, my husband and I are going through all kinds of genetic testing. No results have been given yet. I was curious if this had happened to anyone else, mainly the holoprosenphly. There is not much information on this particular disease that I have been able to find."

I know it√¢ Ä ôs a genetic problem and just one of those things, in fact the only real issue I√¢ Ä ôve found is that I can√¢ Ä ôt get a pair of gloves to fit that well, ladies gloves fit the fingers a little better but aren√¢ Ä ôt quite wide enough.Recently though, I have been getting severe pain in my hands and feet and I can only liken it to a muscle cramp or a very painful tingling feeling. Usually the pain comes when I awake but also happens at fairly regular intervals throughout the day and the symptoms last for about 15 minutes. I√¢ Ä ôm a little bit worried that these symptoms have something to do with the Brachydactylia. I know that the best thing to do is to go and see a doctor but I thought I would post on here first to see if anyone else has heard of anything similar."

I have severe skin reactions in the form of painful, bright red, itchy rash/splotches when I eat/touch/come in any kind of contact with citiric acid (oranges, grapefruit, lime, lemon)    and have been hospitalized for autoeczematization ( reaction to infection in the form of full body eczema)I have eczema almost constantly in between my fingers, in the crooks of my elbows, behind my knees, and around my torso. I the summertime it also spreads up my arms and around the sides of my back (up high, under the shoulders. At its worst, I had it covering my entire back, torso, stomach and half of my face.

"146"	"520104"	"May 27, 2008"	"Hi, I'm new to this forum and hope I can get some insight on this...I've got Ehlers-Danlos type II (hypermobility type), and for the record, I've also got CFS, or as it should be called : NeuroEndocrineImmune Dysfunction Syndrome or NDS.My most recent injuries are 3 partially torn ligaments (plus cartilage tear) in my right (dominant) wrist.All injuries are pretty old, but when you have hypermobility, it takes a lot to have something investigated, and when they finally decide to do so, it takes forever here in Quebec (more than a year since the consultation where the doc decided I should have the exam to the consultation where I got the results)So the first tear happened well over 4 years ago (didn't even notice how, just kept re-injuring it every 2 weeks or so!), and a year and a half ago I sprained the wrist good, and that's when I torn the 2 other ligaments and the cartilage. Doesn't take much anymore : it crackes when I made a \"rough\" move to put on my vest! Of course, it was one of the rare times when I didn't have my cast on (for the previous tear).So I finally got exams and conclusive results (which is rare in our cases, huh? In fact, I only agreed to do the exams if the doc agreed to seriously look it through even if a tear had partially started to heal).Of course, because of the underlying situation, individual repairs of all 3 ligaments would be pretty much useless, the doc said, and he'd be surprised if we could find any surgeon willing to do it.Even though I agree, I was pretty frustrated, because why then did he want to do the exams? He could pretty much guess what we would find (except we thought there would be max. 2 tears, not 3 PLUS cartilage!!!).So I made him understand my deception, and that doing nothing meant I'd have to spend the rest of my life with the cast on my wrist! (I re-injure too easily and it hurts too much).So he stopped, thought, and asked how much I needed the cast in my everyday life. After I drew him a pretty ugly picture, he agreed to ask for a surgeon's opinion on repairing the torn ligaments... but not before he talked to me about another option!Pretty dramatic, but much more interesting to me than he would've ever thought : LIMITED CARPAL FUSION, or partial wrist fusion (there are at leas 2-3 other names out there!). : Instead of the big bar that fuses the hand with the forearm with all the bones in between like in the \"total\" fusion, it's only some of the numerous bones that compose the hand and wrist. Of course how many and which ones will have to be decided by the surgeon (with me, of course), but I guess it would be between 3 and 8.The biggest advantage would be no more sprains. Maybe even less pain, but I'm not even hoping for that. The pain isn't really related to bone movement anyways, like in arthritis.Repairing the torn ligaments is of no use because not only could I tear them again in a year, but I could tear the ligament just next to one of them just as soon. There are so many ligaments in there that there are endless possibility to an EDS III body... ;o)I do understand a surgeon not really wanting to \"waste\" his time and energy on a job not really \"worth it\". Plus, I personnaly could waste healing time and a lot of pain for nothing too... Just trying to imagine how I'd feel spraining my wrist in 2 years if I'd go for the repair option... :-OWith the fusion, I could no longer sprain the wrist ligaments, so we would know for sure it wouldn't be for nothing...The big NO argument of course is the loss of mobility. Well I especially understand how it's so huge in the mind of a doctor, for whom health and the best working body is a must, and also coming from someone in good health!But for me, having used a cast completely limiting my wrist movements for more than 2 years now, I honestly have trouble seeing the problem with limited movements... Especially since I'm guessing the limited fusion would give me more mobility than the cast!I've been hoping for the past year that I'd get a surgery, thinking the whole time : the worst that could happen, if it doesn't work, is I'll be stuck in a cast... hum, let's see... I'm already in a cast! ;o)(of course I'm not stupid, I know it could be worst if it doesn't work... there are complications possible. I meant simply not giving the results hoped for).But of course I'd like to hear from others with a similar situation or experience... Am I thinking this right? How bad is the limitation in mobility with a limited fusion surgery?Do they take bone graft with this one as they do with the total fusion?Is it usually under total aenesthetic procedure, or just local?How long did it take you to heal? Because of CFS I can't work anyways, so I'm not worried about going back to work, but simply everyday life, as much of that as I have anyways...Could I have trouble writing after that surgery? (I mean, not immediatly after, but once it's healed)So, thanks a bunch everyone!(sorry for the long post! I tend to do that...)"

Discuss the ramifications that might follow the discovery of cancer susceptibility genes in an individual.QUESTION 2Discuss firstly, the moral arguments that may be used to SUPPORT the production, development, scientific investigation and the use of biological weapons in military and anti-terrorist situations.Secondly, discuss the moral arguments for the rejection of such ideas."

But in researching that I have come to numerous questions about my birth.My parents, as far as I can remember have never talked to me about my birth. There are some pieces to the puzzle here that I call to question, my name was never put on my birth certificate,    and (until I had to get my permit for driving), I heard my sister talking to my mother about my birth awhile ago and she said that \"the doctor didn't know what I was at first\"....I also have always, like the typical people with gender identity disorder always felt more like a boy....since forever.Is it possible that I had some early genital ambiguity and that it was fixed and I wasn't told about it?What makes me question that is that I have never (to my knowledge) received hormone treatment, and I have a normal period in as far as it comes relatively monthly, its hard to say if it skips months because its not all that consistent in that I can't judge when it comes(not that I've really payed a lot of attention to it, with my disorder I prefer to think of it as little as possible).    And it is usually extremely painful, I'm not talking about normal cramps these things leave me writhing and I become nauseous, and sometimes my hands and legs become numb, and no its not because I hyperventilate from the pain, that's what the school nurse thought when I was in high school. I am not sexually active either. And I have gone in about that but I did some blood tests and there was really no conclusion other than take ibuprofen, which I take a lot of and that usually stops them, if I take them in time..is it reasonable to question this?

I have a question for you - since it's complicated - I will give you some back history in order to be able to ask the question and it make sense....My daughter has been a 'medical mystery' for almost 2 years now (she's 3 now).    She has been having many episodes of shaking (but not seizures), unresponsiveness (but breathing normally - just no response even to painful stimuli), fatigue, left side of her face droops/flattens at the nasolabial fold intermittently, right eye has Ptosis, at times her speech is hard to understand, articulation is poor.    She has episodes of left sided weakness.    She has moments where her hands and feet will open wide and she'll posture a bit.    She has feeding difficulty (thin liquids cause her to aspirate requiring thick-it for thin liquids).    She's had one seizure that we are aware of.    She has headaches and tires extremely easily.    On her 'bad' days she falls a lot and is not only irritable, but she usually usually has the droop on the left and the Ptosis on the right occur simultaneously as well as extreme fatigue.    She has had metabolic abnormalities - but nothing that 'screams' anything in particular.Genetic workup has currently revealed (through the work of an amazingly perceptive doctor!)Carrier for Tangier DiseaseMutation at 10398 A>G for the Mitochondrial Genome AnalysisMutation at exon 1 position 37 (Arginine is replaced with Glutamine) for the Episodic Ataxia type 2/FHM 1 gene.    The mutation has never been seen before - but given it's position, the fact that it's replaced with a polar amino acid (glutamine) and the fact that it's been highly conserved across all evolution (the arginine) - and that she was tested for this because she fit most of the symptoms perfectly - they feel this is disease causing.She also has hypogammaglobulinemia and receives weekly infusions of gamma globulin sub-q which has drastically improved her health and quality of life (from that aspect).Family history is strong with many on mothers side of the family having severe migraines, neurological, autoimmune issues, blood sugar issues (diabetes in many and just hypoglycemia in others), autonomic nervous system dysfunction.    Brother has Chiari Type 1, basilar migraines, ketotic hypoglycemia, hypogammaglobulinemia (infusions as well), was dx with Autism at 2 but dx has recently been changed to ADHD with OCD tendencies, heat intolerance.    Brother is not a Tangier carrier.Results are still pending for mother's EA2/FHM - but she is a confirmed carrier of Tangier Disease and also has mutation 10398 A>G in the Mitochondrial Genome Analysis.    The genetics doctor believes there's a very good chance mother has the EA2/FHM mutation given her symptoms being consistent with it.At one point there was talk of having muscle biopsy done - but since the EA2/FHM finding, that has been dropped.    Acetazolamide treatment is in the start of 2nd week.My question is this - the mutation at 10398 A>G has no pathogenic undertones in the general population - symptomatology with this mutation is all over the place....but I have heard 2 doctors pose that, alone this mutation might not mean anything - but given all of our genetic mutations and the nature of EA2/FHM - that the mutations could affect the body enough to cause, at the very least Mitochondrial dysfunction.We are seeing a doctor on Monday to ask about EA2/FHM - from what I've read - this disease CAN cause fatigue, but not to the degree she has - so I wonder if the Mitochondria could be affected in some way and exacerbating things?     What are your thoughts?Thank you for your time!"

I have 3 children that have had various health problems.    Doctors have told us there is no connection.One son was born with Tetralogy of Fallot.    He was also born with a two vessal cord, subglottic stenosis, and anal stenosis.    This child has some issues at school.    Many teachers state that he has ADHD and have suggested we look into medication, but I have not been comfortable with this.    I have also noticed that his lips and eyebrows do not look like the other childrens.    Also, my son is almost 10 yrs old and only weighs 50 lbs.    He is short, but not to an extent that red flags have went up.    Recently, he has had what appears to be blood in his urine, but when tested no blood was present.    Although, the test revealed his urine was high in protein. He has an upcoming appointment and I am going to request that his urine be tested for myoglobin. The only other issues that this child has is that he is prone to cavities and he had feeding problems at birth due to a high palate and oral-motor skills.Another son has been diagnosed with ideopathic short stature and is receiving growth hormone treatment.    He also had an episode where his shoulder seemed to dislocate on its own.    When the doctors tried to relocate it, they decided that his shoulder just sits very loose in its socket and was not actually dislocated.    This son has pretty severe mood problems.Another son has pectus excavatum and is able to dislocate on shoulder.    The shoulder area will stretch to the extent that the tissues resemble when someone is stretching taffy.    He was also born with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and has asthma.Another son has no health issues that we have seen.    He is the youngest.I know not all, but many, of these things are associated with Noonan's syndrome.    I am wondering if Noonan's can be present but be so mild that only one or two characteristics can be exhibited in each child.

Will the Integrated screen automatically yield a high risk result for me because of my age alone? I'm also confused that she says that the highest risk the tests can yield is 1 in 100. This, to me, means a 1% chance of having a baby with one of the birth defects the screen is measuring. However, I keep reading-- and my doctor agrees-- the screen (without amniocentesis) has a 92% accuracy rate in predicting Downs Syndrome (or Trisomy 18 or a neaural tube defect). This is conflicting data to me. If I got a positive on the integrated screen, could I interpret that to mean there is a 92% chance my baby has one of the 3 birth defects?

My family always laughs at me saying Im being a hypochondriac but I know my body and I know its not well. What my concern is that my family has a history of Cancer and cysts. My mother whom I just met only a few years ago told me recently that her maternal grandmother had Breast cancer which resulted in a double mysectomy at the age of 50. My mother had a removal of a benign breast tumor, multipul ovarian cysts, removal of right ovary due to ovarian varicocele (which by the way, was not found until time of surgery to remove a large cyst ), and Endometrial cells now present for 5 mos. with cramping and pelvic pain. D&C, hystoscopy and X-lap scheduled. She also has MS if im not mistaken and liver cancer. Now I have been having some similar problems. Im very cystic and recently have a mass size of 5 maybe 6cm. Ive come very close to having Cervical cancer from Dysplasia thankfully it was cought and had a LEEP. Im in pain most of the time, sex hurts, i tend to bleed after, my ovary area feels like a stress ball being sqeezed, Im bloated all the time, i have a pressure on my bum when i sit, my cycle is wacky, hurts to walk or sit. Now I am really sore on the side of mt right breast. All these things have recently come up. Ive never had these types of symptoms before other than the ovarian cyst pain. Ive called my PCM and had several appointments with \"them\" and have told them my concerns. Now I know that just because my mom has all these things and my grandmother had cancer too that I am not nessesarily next in line. I justam out of ideas how to express my concern and get some real action from them. I even called to ask for a CA125 test done and i was almost laughed at and was told \"no, we dont do that. Until its a concern. You will have to go see an off base doc and pay out of pocket. Ugh, thats what im dealing with!"

We took him to a hand doctor and were told he might have EDS.    Zachary's elbows hyperextend more than 20 degrees.    His lower extremities do not appear to have abnormal flexibility.    He has developed at a normal rate and is very active.    He plays soccer and appears average or slightly above average in his agility and coordination.    He has never had a dislocation.    He does not bruise easily and heals quickly, however, he had stitches in his upper lip last year and they simply fell out, which I read was common in people with EDS.    He also has weak intrinsic hand muscles and is unable to suspend his body weight on the monkey bars, which the other kids in his class seem to do easily.    I took him to a hand therapist and he wears splints on his fingers.    She said his hands were weak and gave him thera putty to squeeze every day.    She thought it was likely that Zachary has EDS but could not make a referral.    Our pediatrician doesn't seem to know much about it and I don't know where to go (we live in Ohio).    I don't know if I should wait to see if he develops more symptoms or aggressively seek to diagnose or rule out this disorder so I can modify his activities and begin exercises that would promote joint stability??    If he does not have EDS why would he have the swan neck deformitities?     Thank you for your help."

"146"	"610860"	"Sep 05, 2008"	"In an 18 week ultrasound our technican found our baby has SUA in the umbilical cord.    On our 24 week ultrasound, they identified a very small 1-5mm mass in the apex of the left ventricle (very safe place to be) saying it could be a cardiac rhabdomyoma, fibroma or a EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus.    They had to look 3x over because of it hiding so well and so small.    I am stressed to the gills with this....Because we lost a child in our previous pregnancy (she had 2 cardiac masses in her left ventricle which were on the actual left ventricle wall and septum), they can't ignore the history and are speculating that this may be the initial signs again of cardiac rhabdomyomas leading to Tuber Sclerosis but they have confirmed they cannot factually say this with the information provided.    Both my husband and I were tested for any Tuber Sclerosis mutation and we have none -- it seems it was a new mutation and there is the possibility of something called gonadal mosaicism where other sperms or eggs could have been affected (1-2% chance)...I read some many folks on the internet saying they had SUA and an EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus -- hence my thinking this sounds more like this is what this is.    we had our screening tests and downs etc. were 1 in 20,000, but apparently now reduced to 1 in 300 because of potentially 2 soft markers.    My husband says forgo any amnio and they are not recommending it but do I do it for a piece of mind?What can I do to ease my mind?    What does this sound like?

I have done a lot of research on this disorder and have found and related a lot of her physical challenges to her SI condition.    She has a learning disability, and gross motor skills have been a challenge to master.    She only learned to ride a bike without training wheels this past spring.    At the age of 17 months she had to have corrective eye surgery due to her eyes crossing.     We are coping with SI with medication and physical therapy.    Another concern is this issue with excessive body hair.    We are not talking about small amounts that are an inconvenience, she asks me to shave her legs at least 2-3 times a week.    Her body hair is the consistancy of a man's hair on his legs or arms.    Even after we shave, the hair is prickly and stubbly.    The hair is not a typical females hair follicle.    She is embarrassed and takes special attention to hide her hair problem, even at the age of 9.    About a year ago, I noticed that she had developed pubic hair.    That concerns me.    She is more developed than that of my 12 year old daughter.    The hair on my 9 year olds body is mostly black (unless she has been in the pool) and course.     If this was a problem within my family with other members, I would not feel as concerned.    However, I do not have any background ethnicity that would make me find this condition somewhat normal.    One thing to note; my daughter when delivered, the physician asked me what nationality my husband was.    He is Caucasian.    Before we were discharged from the hospital, they did a few genetic tests on her because her feet and hands were \"puffy\".    She also had such thick body hair; they felt that the tests would be beneficial.     The blood work came back ok.     I am just concerned that we are missing a condition not picked up with normal blood work.    This could be a pituitary issue.    Especially with the learning challenges that she has been diagnosed with.     One more thing to note.....she is sick a lot.    I would say almost monthly.    Her resistance to illness is very weak!    She has been in school only 2 short weeks and already sick.    Please any assistance will help!"

"146"	"763771"	"Feb 13, 2009"	"I am having ultrasounds done every three weeks in a high-risk perinatal assesment facility due to an unknown cervical mass that may have been the cause for spotting early in my pregnacy. However, the mass now cannot be seen on ultrasound at 28 weeks yet another cause for concern has arisen. During my 25 week ultrasound it was noted that the female fetal head was lagging behind in growth (about the 8th percentile) while the rest of her body was growing normally. Now at 28 weeks her head is still behind in growth (one measurment three weeks behind and the other four) while her body is measuring normal for 28 weeks! There are no other markers of a problem during ultrasound and none found in genetic testing\counceling (quad screen). Her brain structure appears normal and I was told not to worry but at the same time it was suggested that I have a fetal MRI and\or amnio-centisis. I am very concerned about the outcome of this finding and would like to know what the odds are that this will eventually become a diagnosis of microsephaly? and the odds are of her head catching up in third trimester growth?MD. Response:Doctor's Answer by Elaine Brown, MDFeb 12, 2009 11:55PMTo: NeedSecondOpinionHi!The biggest problem with doing tests is that very often something \"incidental\" is found which leads to lots more tests.Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference which is more than three standard deviations below the normal range.    I don't know if your baby's head meets criteria for that, and I'm going to bet it doesn't.Fetal position can have a lot to do with head measurements. If the baby's head is down really deep into the mom's pelvis, the head can be compressed and look smaller than it really is-- having the MRI wil help sort this out.You don't mention any of the major causes of mircrocephaly which also makes it less likely.    Also, you don't mention any other abnormalities which might be part of a syndrome--and    an islolated finding is less likely to be serious.Its your call on the amnio--but they are not too bad when done by    a high risk specialist,It is probably worth the peace of mind to do it.Finally, does anyone in the family have a small head?    Findings like these are often familial.It sounds like your team intends to follow up on the finding, and not just leave you hanging.    Trust your docs and ask lots of questions.Most likely, your baby will be perfect.    What is her name?Good luck!Dr BMy response:To: Elaine Brown, MDThank you soooooooo much for your input Dr. B! Her name is Tempest Rae. : )    My doctors agree that she does'nt meet the criteria for microsephaly but also stated that they could'nt tell me 100% that she does'nt have a problem in there. One said that smaller head size can mean smaller brain. I'm not sure if a fetal MRI can diagnose something like that. Furthermore, she has not been in the head down position when these measurments were being considered. As for a small head being familial I would'nt necessarily consider the father of my babys head small but rather elongated and maybe somewhat pointed while he is 6' 2\" and very thin(always has been). I must say it is of rather odd shape! lol. As for her older sibling, almost 3 years now, I must addmit that her head is noteably small & elongated as well but proportionate with her small but long body in my opinion. People often comment on how tall and thin she is. At her last pediatric appointment I recall she was in the 10th or 20th% for weight and 70% for height. Head was within normal range but I have not been informed of this measurment lately (now don't I wonder!). I don't know if this has any real relevance in the matter at hand but here are some picture links to make judgement of head size in my unborn childs family(hope it works):http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=46254&imageID=15669986http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=1412605&imageID=19679161http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=1412605&imageID=19679163http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=46254&imageID=16228441"	"1"	"small fetal head,microsephaly"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

He also told me and my four brothers, our children and my father's siblings we should all be tested for the disorder.    My mother tested negative.    I asked my dr. and my endo and they said I didn't need to be - the oncologist disagrees.    Why can't everyone agree on what should be a pretty standard answer??    Now my daughter's dr.

I find that odd.    hahaMy dad also has non-hodgkins lymphoma so treating him for this has not been easy. He has low blood pressure and his hemoglobin levels are low after weekly bleeds so it's going to be a long time before he is better.    He has to skip weeks because of it so that just puts him further behind on the treatment.

I have been thinking about ordering one, telling them that its an allergy test (so they'll actually do it), and mailing off to the company who makes it. Also, are there any good, accurate paternity test out there I can get? (Again, I want this to be one I can do at home--like the one they have available at the DNA Diagnostics center)"	"1"	"dad,paternity test,Paternity Testing,mom"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

The doctor then said this my have come from him swallowing something in the womb,or he has an infection in his stomach. I am very confused after him telling me this I was told to wait a week. This was to see if the spot disappeared from his stomach. My question is do I need to see another doctor? If in fact this is an infection that he has won't this cause more harm to my son by waiting to do something about it? How can this be treated while he is still inside growing? Please help me out.

He has a significant speech delay although he is able to communicate and be understood.    He has had a history of behavior problems since his adoption ranging from rages for 2-3 hours and more (when adopted - 3 years old) which have now improved to be more like aggitation/moodiness/impulsive and obsessive-compulsive (although much of the time he seems perfectly \"normal\" and happy).    In addition, he had significant coordination and balance issues but now plays sports (basketball and football).    He is having difficulty learning to read although he can read at about a 1st grade level.    He has never been officially diagnosed with anything other than ADHD and Mild MR.    Should we pursue having him go through genetic testing?    Any information you could provide would be appreciated.

Until now, the reasons for that variance have been unclear.Plavix \"targets a very important receptor on platelets, but people vary substantially in how good an anti-clotting effect they have\" from the drug, explained Dr. Robert F. Storey, from the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Sheffield School of Medicine in the United Kingdom. He is also the author of an accompanying comment in the journal.\"The variation in response is partly due to genetics, but there are other factors such as age which influence the response,\" Storey said.For the study, a team led by Dr. Gilles Montalescot, from the Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere in Paris, collected data on 259 patients aged 45 and younger who suffered a first heart attack and were given Plavix.Among these patients, 28 percent carried a gene variation called CYP2C19*2. This variation is common among the western population and even more common in Asia, the researchers noted.During an average of a year of follow-up, patients with the gene variation were more than three-and-a-half times more likely to die, have another heart attack or require additional cardiac treatment compared to those without the variation, the researchers found.In addition, patients with CYP2C19*2 were six times more likely to have a blockage in a stent they had received after a heart attack.Moreover, the variation continued to cause heart problems up to eight years after treatment with Plavix. In fact, patients with the variation were four times more likely to suffer additional heart problems after receiving the blood thinner.So, what can be done to minimize the risk? \"Checking people's genetic make-up after a heart attack is probably not necessary, since it may be better to do a different blood test to see if they have had a good anti-clotting response to clopidogrel,\" Storey said. He added that \"new treatments that work more reliably than clopidogrel should hopefully be available within the next year or so.\"Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, noted that treatment with Plavix in combination with aspirin does greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients after an acute coronary event, or in patients undergoing coronary stent placement.\"However, it is well recognized there is variable response to clopidogrel, and some patients have thrombotic events, despite treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel,\" Fonarow said. \"If these findings can be confirmed in additional studies, genetic testing may be useful in personalizing the choice and dosing of anti-platelet therapy in cardiovascular patients,\" he said.Two other recent studies also found problems with Plavix in some patients.In one study of 259 people treated with Plavix, published in the Aug. 12 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers found that patients who smoked had significantly less clot formation than nonsmokers.In a second study, published in the Oct. 28 online edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Austrian researchers found that calcium channel blockers drugs, widely prescribed to lower blood pressure, might reduce the Plavix' anti-clotting effects.More informationFor more on Plavix, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.SOURCES: Robert F Storey, M.D., Cardiovascular Research Unit, University of Sheffield School of Medicine, U.K.; Gregg C.

I am writing to see if anyone is familiar with a genetic disorder that involves epicanthal folds and short 4th toes. I noticed my 6 yr old's unusual eye lids when she was born.    I work in eye care so I was probably predisposed to noticing this, lol.    Her eyes watered a great deal and I could tell her lower lids were a little odd and the inner canthi didn't look quite normal.    But none of her doctors ever seemed to be concerned, including our eye doctor, and I never brought it up.The other day she asked me to paint her finger and toe nails and for the first time I noticed the 4th toe of each foot is noticably short.    Her toe nails also seem a little clubbed on each toe, but the 4th toes especially.We've dealt with some developmental issues that had to do with over-sensitivities to clothing tags and sock seams, as well as an intolerance for being bounced around, etc.    The ped even looked into her having something called sensory integration dysfunction.    It was investigated, but discarded as a diagnosis eventually.    It was also suspected she had some visual problems since she turns her head to focus on things closely, etc.    But aside from a fairly mild glasses prescription, the eye doc thought she was ok and would outgrow this head tilt habit.She is in the second half of her k'garten year and we have dealt with a few learning issues, but nothing really severe so far.I have read everything I can find on disorders that might result in both epicanthal folds and short 4th toes, but so far the only ones I can find report severe mental retardation and other physical traits she does not display.Does anyone know if there is a disorder that has these two specific traits?

I work in eye care so I was probably predisposed to noticing this, lol.    Her eyes watered a great deal and I could tell her lower lids were a little odd and the inner canthi didn't look quite normal.    But none of her doctors ever seemed to be concerned, including our eye doctor, and I never brought it up.The other day she asked me to paint her finger and toe nails and for the first time I noticed the 4th toe of each foot is noticably short.    Her toe nails also seem a little clubbed on each toe, but the 4th toes especially.We've dealt with some developmental issues that had to do with over-sensitivities to clothing tags and sock seams, as well as an intolerance for being bounced around, etc.    The ped even looked into her having something called sensory integration dysfunction.    It was investigated, but discarded as a diagnosis eventually.    It was also suspected she had some visual problems since she turns her head to focus on things closely, etc.    But aside from a fairly mild glasses prescription, the eye doc thought she was ok and would outgrow this head tilt habit.She is in the second half of her k'garten year and we have dealt with a few learning issues, but nothing really severe so far.I have read everything I can find on disorders that might result in both epicanthal folds and short 4th toes, but so far the only ones I can find report severe mental retardation and other physical traits she does not display.Does anyone know if there is a disorder that has these two specific traits?    Or can the others I have read about present in very mild forms where the intellectual development issues are less obvious?TIA"	"0"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

He survived only 7 days, my husband and I both had our blood taken for further tests to see if we are carriers of this disorder.    Trisomy 16 has been one of the hardest disorders to find information on. Most of the information I have found about our situation with the q+ has resulted in stillborn or death.    Our results should be in this week, I am sitting on pins and needles waiting for answers.    If we are carriers of this disorder what is the likelyhood of being able to conceive a child without this disorder?    If we are not carriers, was this just a fluke and we can try again?

Assessments have placed him at the emotional level of a 3-4 year old with severely delayed gross and fine motor skills. He is currently finishing grade 1 and is able to read at a lower level, but has great difficulty with printing, drawing shapes, and coloring and is far behind his classmates in all areas. He can follow complex directions. He can also navigate well on the computer and is pretty good at understanding and playing video games, but has trouble with cooperative play and rules. His vocabulary is adequate, but he has slurred speech and can be difficult to understand. Physically, he is average height and quite slender with very poor muscle tone. He has a distinctly awkward gait and has difficulty determining spatial relations and body positioning. His facial features are slightly dysmorphic - broad forehead, wideset eyes, heavy jaw - and he has difficulty chewing and swallowing. He has frequent asthma attacks that require hospitalization. Although he is at times frustrated by his limitations (the mind is willing but the body is weak), he is a sweet, loving and thoughtful boy.He has been undergoing assessments to determine the extent and long-term implications of his disabilities. All of his biological tests came back normal except for the karyotype, which indicated an abnormality - inv(21)(q11qq22.3). I understand that and extra copy of chromosome 21 causes Downs Syndrome, but what exactly does particular notation mean?We have so many questions. Is this simply a 'delay' in development? Will he catchup, or will he reach a certain point and not progress further? What are the long-term mental and physical health implications associated with abnormalities on this chromosome (i.e., Alzheimer's, nervous disorders, cancers, or other medical problems)?His follow-up appointment to discuss these results is not scheduled until August. In the meantime, we have to deal with his teachers and the school board to determine a suitable program for him next fall. We know he should be held back, but at the same time, it would be crushing for him to see another group of children move past him in the system next year. The school will not assign a classroom aide or developmental curriculum without a clear diagnosis. We would like to have at least some interpretation of these results in order to press for the special consideration he needs to succeed at school.Any insight would be most appreciated."

It was the beginning of summer and I just had to vomit, all day. I would awake daily at 6 or 7 am due to the severe desire to vomit, and then have that feeling througout the day, occasionally actually vomitting. I would be in bed around midnight due to the horrible desire to vomit all the time, and then would have sleepless nights or frequent wakings due to the desire.There was no dizziness, no headache, no cough, no fever, no GI discomfort, nothing else but the desire to throw up. The feeling strengthened and weakened randomly in the day, but never really went away. I had very little appetite and thirst those days as most of what i ate was regurgitated and the feeling to consume was weak. I lost a lot of weight and became very weak.This persisted for weeks. I was at the hospital 4 or 5 times, never admitted. Each time the recommendation was observation and rehydration, no diagnosis ever. Blood work, urine, stool, all normal. No other symptoms made it difficult to assess as well.We then decided to go to Germany (homeland, i live in asia) for a vacation and diagnosis. I was petrified with fear because i thought i would vomit and be sick for the 24 hour total journey. The moment I was in the cab to the airport I felt much better (this aspect will come into play later). The trip went smoothly. In germany, all was well so we didnt see the need to seek help. After 2-3 weeks however, it came back as strong as ever, exactly the same way as before. So we sought a pediatrician.This new bloodwork revealed a deficiency in magnesium (however no other signs of magnesium shortage were present, by the way, I am starting third year med school in a month, and have actively researched my condition to no avail). I was prescribed supplements and within minutes of taking one, like magic I felt as strong as an ox. Maybe a placebo effect (then again i was 7 at the time) or the real cause but i felt great.I continued to take Mg supplements for about a year, and no symptoms ever returned during this time. When we ran out of tablets, we just never restocked, and all was ok.Over the next few years, it was mostly okay, every now and then, mostly random, sometimes Christmas, Summer, Term exams, regular school days, it would return, but much much weaker in feeling. A tablet got rid of it for that day immediately.On the start of college though, it was back and fiercer than ever. After about one week of school, the following monday, I awoke to the most severe attack since I was a child. I began popping supplemements, but this time, there was no effect, may as well have been candy. This continued for about 1 month. I could not lose the feeling, and then I began taking many different supplements, but to no avail. Eventually, it tapered and vanished, but it was terrible. Could barely focus, read, study, anything.It returned the next year, right after summer, again same duration and intensity, no help from supplements. Same symptoms, gone in a month.That summer, i had a theory. Maybe it was the inaction. All summer I game, sleep long hours, eat heavy, etc., then all of a sudden back to buisness, figured it might be some metabolic shock. So that summer, i decided to walk, a lot. 7-9 hours a day in the city, every other day. When i returned for my third undergrad year, i felt great, no symptoms. Again, maybe a placebo, maybe a new cause.I did this for two years. On the end of undergrad, i was so exhausted, i decided to spend my last free/good summer as a nobody student, that i gamed again, it had been 2 years since the last attack so i was confident. Returned to first year med, this time it lasted almost 3 months. I saw a doctor, and they said it was most likely anxiety. She had another patient who only had the desire to vomit during big life changes. Moving, new school, new job, death, etc. about two weeks each time. She said to relax, and stay hydrated.At the end of 1st year, i got a full time job (been working part time till now, decided to extend hours into the summer), start of second year, perfect.This summer, we went to Kuala Lumpur to watch the Sepang Malaysian GP, a gift for my bro who just finished med school. We left straight after my family exams, from the University. Whole trip was fine. On the last day, I had a severe vomit attack AND diarrhea.It might be pertinent to mention now that every few weeks I get hypermotility diarrhea when im nervous or tense, usually just take a motilium (anti-cholinergic) and Im alright. I never vomit throughout the year (only start if school) and certainly never have both at the same time. The tension diarrhea only started in med school (yes, im quite the broken human arent I :) ).It was horrible. For 12 hours on the travel home, i popped 3 motiliums and carried an array of bags to vomit into. After I got home, a good nights sleep, and it was gone. For the past 3 days, been laid back gaming. Now the 4th day, its back and stronger than ever.Just for the record, during the flight home, today, and the attacks of the past 3 or so years, I walk arounf for 1-2 hours and feel much better, but not gone.Any ideas?It might be Mg, but why does it no longer work. Might be anxiety, but why only end of summer, why not final exams, funerals, Xmas and bad family reunions, hospital work (we are a PBL school, we go into the hospital from year 1). Why does walking help? Might be a placebo effect. Why only after dormancy...or rather mostly. Why the attack in malaysia, and the random strikes as a child.Any ideas, drugs, anything?Just on a dramatic side not, it is so severe and the feeling so bad, i actually hope for death. Wake up, throw up, want to throw up all day, wanes only. Cant read, eat, sleep, watch TV or anything. This for on average one month.

The MoM values for AFP was 0.53 (17.8 ng/mL), uE3 was 0.79 ( 2.16 ng/mL), hCG was 0.82 ( 21.4 IU/mL), inhibinA was 2.26 ( 427.0 pg/mL). My age at term would be about 31 years.I repeated the triple screen at 17.4 weeks according to LMP (though U/S that day gave a GA of 18w2d), and this time my risk was calculated to be 1:8000. The MoM values for    AFP was 0.48 (27.5 ng/mL), uE3 was 4.13 (5.6 ng/mL), and hCG was 0.94 (23.2 IU/mL). Note that this was done in a different lab.I would like to add that I had also done a first trimester NT plus PAPPA blood screen, which gave me a down's risk of < 1:5000. The MoM for NT was 0.8, and the PAPPA was 1.73.Additionally my level II U/S had no markers and everything looked absolutely normal. My question is based on the way my uE3 changed between the 2 maternal serum tests, I think the risk changed significantly. Does this change in uE3 seem like what would be expected at that stage in pregnancy? How much should I worry about this first multiple marker result though it seems like a false positive?I declined the amnio but now am going back and forth wondering if that was the right decision. I am looking for someone to look at my numbers closely, and see if they seem possible for an unaffected pregnancy. Just to add, I am carrying a female fetus if that adds any more information and my racial origin is Asian.I really look forward to an answer from one of the doctors since I think I am running out of time for an amnio.Thanks!"

If I change my diet by adding more B vitamins and folate, will it change the mutation?I need some clear answers.    My doctor said it is nothing to worry about.

A number of days ago we got the results of the amnio fluid test which have shown that the fetus has turner mosaic 45x0/46xx with 30% of abnormal cells. We insisted on doing the FISH test to confirm the result. In the FISH test only 11% of cells (172 cells were tested) were found with turner 45xo, others were normal. Since the FISH test is performed directly on the cells taken from the amnio fluid we may assume that this result is more precise than the first test that had been performed on cultured cells. It should also be noted that so far the fetus develops absolutely fine and all ultrasound tests done so far were absolutely normal with no signs of any kind of patology.We went to genetic counseling and they explained us the symptoms of Turner syndrom(syndrome)and told that with the mosaic of 11% the symptoms are expected to    be milder (taking into cosideration also that there is nothing abnormal seen on US). Nevertheless, some doctors told us not to take chances and recommeded to stop the pregnancy.It is a very hard decision to make. My question is: Can anyone tell us what is the probability that our girl will have the symptoms of turner, such as short height, infertility and other problems based on what we know so far - 11% of 45xo and absolutely normal US at 23 weeks. Are there any additional tests that can be done?Unfortunately we don't have much time, since if we decide to stop the pregnancy it must be done next week.Thank you in advance,Alex"	"10"	"Pregnancy,Turner Syndrome,mosaicism"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

I have been having chest and joint pain ever since I was 10 (Maybe younger, I have a bad memory with things like that), I'd had 2 separate \"Take-Home\" EKG's, once when I was 10 or 11, the next when I was 13 or 14, each time they came back saying \"We don't see anything that would cause pain\".    I was then referred to a chiropractor due to the fact I was always dislocating... everything, her diagnosis was \"You're just very loosely put    together, we should strengthen the muscles around your joints\"I tried my best but it hurt, bad, I had to quit my baseball team making up the excuse that \"I don't like my coach\" when in fact I was dislocating my shoulder and the pain was just getting worse, my father had become very good at \"resetting\" my shoulder for me, and couldn't pitch like I used to be able to, since then I had started pretending to my parents that I was getting better because I was scared they were going to find something seriously wrong with me at that point and that maybe I would grow out of it, a feeling which had stuck with me all the way up to the diagnosis of EDS, I had at that point been hiding symptoms from my doctors because of that fear (Yes, I realize its stupid but try going through what I went through).    The diagnosis of EDS was still made regardless because of the apparent physical evidence and family history, they had originally thought I had Marfan after my most recent pneumothorax.My question is:    There are certain things I have come to understand and accept, I need to know what kind of reaction I will get if I \"come clean\" to my geneticist and primary care physician about hiding symptoms so I wouldn't be diagnosed with something because I was scared to death of the answer. an answer that I may never had if I hadn't been taken to the hospital due to the pneumothorax."

On Friday, April 3rd,    I went to the doctor with bad back aches and they gave me meds for a bladder infection, by Monday it wasnt better so the doc called in a different prescription.    I was using the ortho evra birth control patch, and had been for about 4 years.    Well my period was due April 24th and never came, so I took a test and it was positive.    I made an OB appointment for the first of May, and they did an ultrasound and asked what the first day of my last period was (march 20). Then the doc said i most likely conceived on April 3rd.    Well i know I didnt because I was sick.    My husband and I didnt have intercourse for about a week until i was healthy again.    So I know for a fact I couldnt have conceived from April 3rd-12th.    But all my ultrasounds date me right at conceiving around that time.    Is there any way I could have had sex on April 1, or 2, then took the meds on the 3rd, and it cancelled out my birth control and the sperm was still in me from the previous day, and thats how i conceived?    Since I was wearing my birth control patch, the only thing we could think of was that the antibiotics from the doctor cancelled out my BC.

We began seeing a Orthopedist when he was 3 for toe walking and inversion of the feet. Diagnosis.....tibial torsions. Into physical therapy we went with shoe inserts. As he grew he required more and more physical therapy. And is now on his 4 set of inserts. At 12 he began having horrible leg pain. He often was unable to participate in activities and we had to change plans as a result. At this time the x-rays showed flat feet and hammer toes. Leg pain was to the point of barely walking sometimes. All through this the therapist was documenting tight tendons. As a result he had bilateral heel lengthenings in 2007. He did well and was able to perform in the school musical as the lead and grew 6 inches. Then the back spasms started and the unretractable leg pain. It was so bad one day the school wanted to call an ambulance to get him. He has been on many different pain medications. And back to physical therapy again. After the 3rd appointment the therapist refused to treat him saying he needed a hamstring lengthening. Prior to this he had seen 2 different neurologist. The first saying he needed pyschological help since his EMG was normal. The other changed his medicine and again sent him to physical therapy. He usually can't make it all week at school although he walks with a cane. Stairs are impossible and forget getting on the floor. Prior to all this he was active and very helpful. He is becoming depressed because he can't even do simple things. A trip to an amusement park left him crying in pain for 2 days not to mention extremely humiliated. His twin brother is becoming frustrated because he needs to help more around the house. I might add that He had 2 MRI's a lumbar and a thoracic. I am so frustrated and my son is devastated.

Additionally, I have found different research that indicates that the same MTHFR mutation can manifest as Aspergers (or high-functioning autism).I have 2 children ... one was born with a hairy sacral patch and a sacral dimple (suspected of spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome, neither confirmed, but plenty of opposing doc opinions) and later we found the Arnold-Chiari Malformation. My older child has Asperger-like behaviors (Autism Spectrum Disorder), OCD, and Sensory Processing Dysfunction.I am curious if there has been a study of siblings to determine if MTHFR could be the missing link in causing this sort of \"coincidence\".Also, MTHFR mutations can cause pre-eclampsia in pregnancies. I was borderline pre-eclampsia for my first child.Thanks in advance for you reply,MargaretThis discussion is related tomthfr gene."

A dear friend of mine just found out that her 2-year-old daughter has a rare chromosomal deletion, apparently she is missing the short arm of chromosome 16? She's got a severe protein allergy and receives special formula through a G-tube in her stomach....she also has speech delays as a result of this rare chromosomal problem. I was wondering what are the treatment options for this?    Do they have genetic therapy that they can perform to help her overcome this deficiency? I am asking because, while I know my friends are exploring every avenue of knowledge/treatment, I was hoping maybe I could help them come up with some more knowledge. I would appreciate any help you can offer....I know this is a very rare condition, but I'm just hoping to help them shed some light on this situation. They've been trying to come up with an answer for this ever since their baby started showing severe allergies to breastmilk at around a year of age and her growth began to stunt. They finally have this answer, but it's not really much of an answer and I know they're relieved to know but frustrated at not knowing more!!

My brother finally received a coupleof answers from his neuro- headaches he is currently experiencing are called \"thunder clap\" headaches and that he has venous cerebular thrombosis. he started the same way i did with fighting hypersensitivity to infections until it finally resulted in cns/neuro effects. My son is the same as am I. I had been diagnosed with ms for 13 years and now they are re-evaluating. Recent changes in my health are excessive profuse sweating that has now changed to oilly thick sweat, foul smelling liquid draining from my ears (ruled out infection) trouble swallowing and nubness in face. this on top of extreme fatique 2 years of chronic pain,    balance probllems etc etc etc. when i first met my neuro he had mentioned adrenoleukodystrophy and then never again (after telling me to watch lorenzos oil    movie.then i plug in my brother's new partial diagnosis :venous cerebral thrombosis guess what one of the causes can be? Adrenaleukodystrophy. I see my neuro on Tues and hopefully we will ALL find out what the heck we are dealing with. i don't know whether to be relieved or scared especially for my son he is only 20 years old.if any of you have this disease and can help me sort through all this i would be eternally grateful!CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE!!!"

He started having seizures when he was 2 yrs old. These seizures were called febrile seizures. I have researched this disease endlessly. The problem I am having with him is his behavior. He had a test done through the school board who found that he is intellectually disabled as well. So he only learns at the age of a 3-4 yr old. Will this ever increase as he gets older or will this get worse? How do we treat his behaviors? The school he is in has done a phenomenal job with him but his violence and aggressiveness is not controlled. Now we're having to look at other means of help. But the waiting lists are so long and I have exhausted all means of help where I live. He has had control of his seizures for about 10 months now which is awesome. Now who do I turn to for help so that my son can get the best education possible.I would also like to know of all of the reasons why and how this disease is caused because it really does confuse me. My son was a normal little boy but seemed to be developmentally delayed in most areas. Especially with his speech. Now I have another little boy who seems to be presenting almost all of the same problems with delayment as my 8 yr old did. My baby has also had a seizure about a year ago. He has speech problems as well. He is going to be two next month and is very inconsistent with his speech. He is receiving help with his speech and physio therapy as well as play therapy to try to catch him up to his age level. Would a baby who has had severe bronchitis with a really high fever and cannot keep anything down from either end be susceptible to getting this type of disease? He was treated at the hospital for his sickness but was never hospitalized. I just need to know how to understand this disease completely. I am also looking to talk with anyone who deals with this disease. It feels so lonely to deal with something so rare and not have a person in the world who understands where you are coming from.

I've been in the natural healing field for years and have been researching my long term illnesses, but I don't have a clue as to how this condition might affect my situation or which, if any, of my symptoms, can be caused by such a genetic condition.I    was unknowingly exposed to toxic mold for many years in a rental apartment.    I lived there since 1979, but wasn't aware of the mold until it started to smell in 2003, at which time I began to understand all of the debilitating illnesses that had been overtaking my body for many years.As soon as I moved in I developed constant yeast infections, and within a year, I developed carpal tunnel syndrome in BOTH of my hands.    I'm right handed and was doing some repetitive motion work so thought it was caused solely by that.    Come to find out that the mold exposure could have 'triggered' sjogrens syndrome and that the carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by it due to nerve issues that present with sjogrens.    In retrospect I can see that many of my mysterious symptoms over the years can be caused by sjogrens.I recently had an HLA-DR genetic blood test to learn if my genetics can cause me to not be able to 'detox' the mycotoxins from mold exposure.    This is one in a series of blood tests that some doctors are using to determine if mycotoxins are making a person sick.    If the body doesn't recognize mycotoxins as 'toxic', they just keep circulating and making the person sicker.    I've been getting sicker and sicker despite all of my attempts to 'detox'.    I'm a very health conscious person and have been working very hard to regain my health, but instead I just keep getting sicker.    I've moved 5 times in 2 1/2 years to try to find a rental in my area that doesn't have mold in it.    This discovery of the 'homozygous' condition may hold some answers as to why I can't recover from the toxic mold exposure.Thank you very much"	"0"	"homozygous,HLA-DR test"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

Firstly she claimed I had nappy rash and the scar on my upper thigh was a nappy rash scar- responses to childhood questioning. Adult questioning has resulted in this story of me being born with a hole near my vagina. She fobbed it off as if it was nothing. Further to this she claims I was sent home with betadine to wash my nappies in. The scar on my thigh is as a result of this hole, having moved as I grew.......I have had a Doctor look at it and confirm it is NOT a nappy rash scar. It presents as \"keloid like\" triangular approx 1inch in size in top inner thigh 2 inches down from leg/abdomen join.II have contacted the hospital of my birth, and having had the runaround for many years- denied access to birth records because I was not the patient- my mother was- just recently found th right terminology to make the hospital listen to me and allow me access to my records to find information I was seeking. Unfortunately my birth year was 1963, and they only held records from 1966 to current date.I wish to know what kind of test or proceedure was carried out on a newborn in those days. Could I have a scar like this from a skin biopsy? - a skin punch test ...? Could there have been some kind of urogenital surgery- maybe for enlarged clitoris or fused labia, and this information just not shared with me? I feel there is a scar in my labia minora- like they are 'sewn on\", and no- not a fold.I have had genetic testing, and a XX result was gleaned, subsequent to being informed I had Trisomy9 evident in two cells, then having that sidelined as a \"red-herring\" result.Could I in fact have a mosaic condition which has resulted in an irregularity in my genitals?

They did an amnio, which came back negative.Her heart defect partially healed before birth, to a partial AV Canal (or ostium primum ASD)As a newborn, she had GI problems. She had her open heart surgery in 2006 (when she was 6 months old) and her heart is now great.When she turned one year old, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started medication. Even with the low thyroid, she was not heavy at all....she is in fact, quite small for her age (she's almost four and weighs 32 pounds)She then developed ezcema(eczema)and has chronic constipation.She had obstructive sleep apnea, which was thought to be due to enlarged tonsils/adenoids. They were removed three months ago and we are waiting for a follow up appt with the pulmonary dr.She has no facial abnormalities and no developmental delays.    In fact, she is very smart.One dr very casually mentioned on a report that she suspects my daugther may have a connective tissue disorder but did not elaborate.I am just curious to why she has several health issues that are normally related to Down's Syndrome, and they even thought that she was going to have it...but she doesn't.Are they all just coincidental? Or could there still be an underlying cause?Thank you for reading!"

The test was done after seeing 3 GP's, 2 hand specialists and a rheumatologist.    Almost 5 months ago I started having symptoms of pain in my right wrist, it progressed to about 1 month later having extreme pain in the night, tingling and numb fingers.    I had some swelling in my wrist up to that point.    I began using ibuprofen and tylenol to relieve the extreme pain which at that point was a 9 during the day and a 10 at nite.    I also iced it and wore a splint.    My fingers began swelling along with my hand and wrist, mostly my pinky and ring finger.    I had an MRI, which showed I had significant inflammation and was sent to the rheumatologist who tested me for HLA-B27, which was positive.    He told me the name of the disease I have is HLA-B27.    I don't understand, because it talks about the gene making you be more susceptible for other things like AS and other spondaloarthopathies, tendonitis, uveitis, etc.    I am on an anti-inflammatory medication, but the I still can't bend my pinky finger because of the swelling.    I was told I have inflammatory arthritis, is that a manifestation of the gene I have tested positive for?This discussion is related toHLA-B27."

"890"	"post_5191616"	"1129074"	"MTHFR and bruising, birth defects, ethnicity"	"146"	"1144507"	"Dec 20, 2009"	"I was tested for MTHFR during my 4th pregnancy (new OB) because I had a prior history of 3 miscarriages.    Before my first successful pregnancy, I went to a fertility doctor (the only 23 yr old there), and was told I lacked enough progesterone to stay pregnant.    After taking progesterone supplements on each pregnancy, I carried 4 children.    It surprised me about MTHFR.    My paternal grandfather was one of 12 boys who all died from (sometimes multiple) heart attacks.    My maternal grandmother suffered from clots her whole life.    My mom (65) has heart failure, but I contributed that to a diabetes complication.    My sister (45) has had clots in her legs and lungs.    My sister (40) has congenital heart defects with her valves (which was diagnosed at 38).    Both she and I have very low blood pressure.    It is only lately, after eating enough salt to fill the Dead Sea, that my blood pressure is finally 110/80.    Before this it was normally 85/72.    If I take any Advil or Aleve, I bruise extensively.    I'm talking 20+ bruises, the size of quarters/half dollars, mostly in my legs, and thighs.    I will sometimes wake up with HUGE bruises which haven't resulted from injury.    I one time went to the Dr. with a sinus infection.    He sent me for a blood test for cancer.    I had a bruise the size of a large cantalope on my thigh.    I hadn't been injured.    Why would a condition that generally causes excessive clotting, cause me to bruise.    I can't help to think that they are related.    My OB only told me I had one type not two.    She said it didn't put me at risk for stroke etc.    I don't think she really knew a lot about it.I'm just asking, but does this run in certain ethnicities??    I know diabetes does, and since my great grandma was a full blooded Sioux, I attributed the diabetes to her.    Does this have anything to do with MTHFR??Any suggestions/advice is helpful.    Are there any birth defects related to MTHFR??    A few things that I have noticed in my 4 sons are:    One has lop ears, apraxia, loud heart murmur, a slightly concave chest, food allergies, constant diarrhea, and a prominent spine.    One has food allergies (bright red blood in stool at 2 months), prominent spine, and constant diarrhea.     One had bloody vomit, reflux, and severe food allergies (now on feeding tube formula).    My last son seems fine.    Obviously food allergies run in the family.    The two boys' prominent spines are in the lower portion of the back.    One has a hairy patch on it.    You can't tell by looking, but you can tell by feeling it.    There is a definite difference.    All seem to be normal to above average intelligence.    Of course I'm their mom and biased, but I've had comments on them, and one son (only 2 are school age) has straight A's and is being tested for gifted.    The other is on the AB honor roll.I have been cursed with a lousy pediatrician.    He actually told me, a mother of 4, that \"babies spit up\" when I told him that my last son vomited blood, choked on it, and turned purple and blue.    I demanded to go to a pediatric gastrolenterologist.    He yelled at me while he wrote the referral.    My son did the same on the specialist's exam table.    The specialist sent him that day for further testing, put him inpatient for further testing and finally put him on feeding tube formula.    Problem solved.    Unfortunately all the specialists require referral here, even though my insurance doesn't.    The pediatrician just tells me that it's a stomach bug when I tell them of the constant diarrhea.    I am looking for a new doctor that takes my insurance.    I know something is wrong.Again, any advice/suggestions are appreciated."

As a child I suffered from chronic tonsil infections.    I used to avoid the sun because I would overheat because I did not sweat. I was always very flexible and everyone used to comment on how soft my skin was.    By the time I was 15 I started experiencing irregular and painful menstrual cyles as well as anemia and migraines.    My blood pressure has always been on the low side.     By the time I hit my early 20's I started having trouble with my intestines.    At 23 I went to the hospital with severe abdominal pain.    My bowels were leaking and were ready to rupture so they performed emergency surgery.    This was 3 weeks before my wedding and I had developed a severe infection in the wound which they were considering packing and leaving open. After aggressive antibiotic treatment the wound started to slowly heal.    Through my life I have had a number of surgeries including colon cancer.    Each time another infection followed.    Every year my symptoms seem to be getting worse, widespread joint and muscle pain, trouble with finding a vein and veins blowing when given an IV or drawing blood,    bruising every time I get a needle,    TMJ, degenerative disc disease, chest pain, edema, weakness in arms and legs etc.    A couple of years ago I was referred to a Neurologist because I had 2 bad migraine attacks that affected my left eye. These were not the first severe migraines I have suffered from or the last.    During his examination he did discover that I had loose ligaments.    I was sent for an MRI, the brain scan showed small vessel disease, increased white matter and some slightly prominent vessels that in their opinion (the unlikely possibility of a small vascular malformation or dural fistula).    Which they told me not to worry about.    I recently had a conversation with my sister and she had mentioned that our scars are not normal.    She works in the medical field and had showed a hematologist she worked with her scars and she was told they were cigarette paper scars and it could be    Ehlers Danlos.     My sister also has problems with joint dislocation.     All my scars look like cigarette paper scars and seem to widen the older they get.    Other abnormalities, flat feet, born with no wisdom teeth, B12 deficiency, lazy eye, trouble with vision and sensitivity to light, shortness of breath, numbness and pins & needles, muscle twitching and spasms,    burning in my calves etc.    Some days I feel like I am going to end up in a wheelchair.    There are also other siblings in my family who suffer from some similar symptoms.    They diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.     Could this be Ehlers Danlos?"

This was discovered after investigations into her global developmental delay. She also has lymphangioma in her eye socket which at this stage is assumed to be unrelated, but who knows. I'm unable to contact the paediatrician at the moment but I have some questions I'd like answered if possible. First of all, I'm a little confused as to why a 'y' chromosome is affected - don't girls only have 'x' chromosomes?? Also, is this likely to affect her menstrual cycle and/or the likeyhood of becoming pregnant when she's older?

She & I share one or two alleles for:    TH01 (6), D18S51 (16), Penta E (13), D13S317 (8), D7S820 (8), CSF1PO (11), Penta D (12), vWA (16), TPOX (8 AND 11).

The baby had an echogenic focus in the heart (EIF) at the 20 week scan, but I was assured this means nothing considering my numbers, which both the doctor and the tech said were \"great\".My question for you all is:     How seriously can I take these numbers?    I know the sequential, or integrated, screen has a 92% accuracy rate.    Which I assume means that 8% of women who get good numbers in fact have a baby with Down's or another problem.    How can I tell if I might be in that 8%?    Would my numbers be a lot worse (I am 30 and was told these are excellent numbers to see on the test)?    Maybe the 8% are closer to the 1:500 range; that is, closer to the cutoff for an amnio.    Or is it a total shot in the dark?    Can somebody with a 1:7,000 risk, as assessed by the screening, have a child with Down's?I am nervous about this, because of the EIF, but also because I always seem to fall into the small percentage category (like, my blood type is not only negative, but also the rarest type on the planet).

I have been reading and reading and Ive found alot of good and useful information. I was hoping to find answers about what I am going through right now. I am pregnant with my 4th, he was a surprise. I have 3 normal, healthy children with the last being born 7 years ago. My family and my husbands family do not have any history of any trisomies or any other genetic disorder. My mom, aunts and grandma all had children in their mid to late 30s. I am 38. Not only was this pregnancy a surprise, but how different I get treated now because of my age has been quite the adjustment too. When I was 31 I didnt have to deal with the high risk talk and the advanced maternal age talk and everything I have been associated with because of my age with this pregnancy.Now for the yucky, confusing, not so fun stuff that Im trying to figure out and find people who can relate. I had the blood test that checks for the risk of Downs and Neural Tube defects, etc. The result of that was \"a mild, very mild risk for Downs\". Thats how the nurse worded it. From there I was told I could go to a bigger city for my next ultrasound where they specialized in high risk pregnancies. Since I wasnt wanting to do an amnio, I thought this would be a nice compromise. I was scheduled for the Level 2 ultrasound 3 weeks from the day I spoke with the nurse about my blood test results. On the day of ultrasound, hubby and I drove to the bigger city where we did not know anyone and nobody knew us. We did the normal things with the nurse and then waited for the Tech to get us for the ultrasound. She came and the Perinatologist joined us for about 3 minutes and then he left to go do a C-section. He was the whole reason we went up there, but whatever. We were doing the ultrasound and about 5 minutes into it, the tech got silent and had a weird look on her face. Not what I was hoping for. Of course she cant tell us anything and the doctor wasnt in there, so we just suffered in silence. I had shown my hubby things to watch for associated with Downs since thats what the blood test had said there was a risk for. She turned the monitor away from me when she got silent but hubby could still see it and he could see what she was looking at, what she was typing, etc. When she was done, she put us in another room to wait for the doctor to return. It was the longest wait ever. In the room, hubby said she had written club foot and banana sign. Everything looked as it should to him except for the foot. The doctor came in and said right off the bat the tech saw a club foot. He gave us a sheet with the markers of the trisomies and showed us that club foot was a marker for T13 and T18. He says we are going back in so that he can see the ultrasound being done. She shows him the foot, he agrees with club foot. She shows him the banana sign, and he asks for the measurement, he says its within normal limits. She shows him the nose and he doesnt see anything wrong with it. She shows him the eyes, again nothing wrong. He asks to see the hands, they are open and look fine. The heart looks fine. Basically, the only thing that wasnt fine was the one club foot. He says the only way to know 100% is to do an amnio. He says he can do it right now. So we do it. He calls a couple days later with the FISH results. It has 3 in the Trisomy 13 spot. He gives us the gloom talk and tells us to wait for the final results of the amnio which should come tomorrow. He says most likely they match up and we shouldnt expect anything different.Im trying to get answers for my specific situation........one marker only (one club foot) appearing during the ultrasound, FISH results positive for T13...........should I full expect the amnio final results to be concurrent with the FISH??

Grandmother (aunt's mother) was recently found to have a 4cm tumor in her stomach at 81, still waiting to hear what kind of gastric cancer. This is a family of hispanic descent, from a place with high prevalence of gastric cancer. Aunt's husband was H Pylori positive and was treated for chronic gastritis. At least two sibings of grandfather (grandmother's husband) died of stomach cancer, no info available about the specific type. Aunt's children (ages 20 to 40) all have some or all symptoms of GERD, IBS, hemorrhoids, gastritis, esophagitis and receive treatment for it. Following grandmother's diagnosis, this whole situation seems to have many coincidences. We have heard that one relative diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer before 50 and other relative with gastric cancer qualifies for testing for the mutation for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (CDH1?) However, we know that from an ethnic point of view there is a higher risk of developing stomach cancer according to the literature. Given that the aunt's children already present gastrointestinal issues that are being treated for, we wonder this family should also pursue genetic counseling/testing and if there would be any benefit from it. In other words, if this kind of history warrants looking more into it. If it does, is it possible to test one/two of the cousins if neither the mother or grandmother are available and still obtain meaningful results?"

This past Thursday I underwent a gum graft procedure and all went fine but a few days after I had a occurrence of non-stop bleeding and had to go back in to get more stitches, the next day I had more persistent bleeding in a different area and had to go back in for more stitches. My peridontist says he has never encountered this problem with a patient and doesn't know why it has happened to me. Especially since it was a few days after the procedure and therefore I was already clotted and healing. We are wondering if it is tied to the connective tissue issues. I am now wondering if I should have gone in for a proper diagnosis so I would know all these issues that could arise.Would a connective tissue disease affect this sort of healing? Is there something I can take/supplement to assist my body?

The baby was born almost 6 lbs and the mother says she was 38 weeks out of 40 when she had the baby. I am thinking maybe the pregnancy had a slow start or took longer bc the baby was born smaller? and I know the mother did smoke during the pregnancy so this may be the reason for the under weight. any help would be greatly appreciated as i am stressed and can not wait to find out if she is my child which I hope she is!"

I come from a long line of tall, thin people who have chronic joint and pain problems.I have been told I have a variety of diagnoses: Patella femeral syndrome, bursitis, fibromyalgia (doesn't quite fit b/c pain is mostly in joints and I don't have the tender points), migraines, TMJ, depression, unexplained neck and back pain...etc. I often feel like they think I'm malingering or seeking drugs, since I have so many seemingly unrelated problems/complaints.My symptoms: I was born with a punctured lung and curved feet that had to be massaged straight. When I was 18, I developed TMJ and the cartilage came off my jaw joint on one side. I used to exercise, but soon developed problems with my knee in my twenties (chronic pain, clicking, and popping of ligaments or tendons). Now I am beginning to have pain in my other knee and ankles. I can no longer run or even walk very far without pain. I also developed chronic pain in my hips. Not sure if it qualifies as subluxation, but my hips seem to slide out of place spontaneously and I have to do a certain movement to pop it back in (makes a loud noise). I get a lot of headaches and migraines. I bruise easily, often not knowing what happened. I got into a minor car accident five years ago, and have had terrible neck and back problems since. My neck or back can \"go out\" by the slightest movement or deep breath....The pain is debilitating! I have ALWAYS had gastrointestinal issues. I deal with intense constipation (doesn't respond much to diet- I eat a lot of high fiber foods, drink water, etc) I recently had surgery on an anal fistula. Doctors don't have a solid explanation for my issues.I can no longer wear a purse, cross my legs, exercise, wear low heels, or sit for long periods w/o pain....And I'm only 33 yrs old. I am rapidly losing the ability to do things I used to do with ease. I am in most of the time now. I feel like my body is falling apart and I don't know why.After looking at EDS, I began to see there may be an answer for all of my issues after all!My mom (plus many in her family) and I have high palates, long limbs (not disproportionate to height, though), and very soft skin.In regard to hypermobility I have always been very flexible. I can touch my thumbs to my wrist, push my fingers far backwards(among many other tricks), put hands flat on the floor w/out bending knees, put legs behind my head, and probably more (waiting for physical evaluation).I plan to pursue medical help, but I'm first doing my own research so I don't get dismissed as being a \"healthy person\" that doesn't really have anything wrong with her. It is so frustrating to suffer from pain the way I do, and not be taken seriously. I am determined to figure this out. This isn't normal, right??Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

Has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis since she was 20. Was recently taking a strong antibiotic classified as a \"sulfa\" drug.

She stayed in the hospital for 3 days and they finally said she had Dystonia brought on by her reaction. She hasn't gotten better. She still can't walk without her legs giving out on her, her hands are stiff and claw like and she has a hard time finding words. She is easily fatigued and has lost weight. My question is this...my dad has hemachromatosis (sp?) and a b12 deficiency. I've read several articles that say a B12 deficiency can sometimes be misdiagnosed with Dystonia. Is that common?

I have lost most of my hair (which, until two and a half years ago, was waist-length and still growing).    I√¢ Ä ôve lost most of my muscle tone and cannot restore it no matter how vigorously I exercise; I have become as shapeless as a half-filled water balloon.    In the space of six months my skin became so loose I now resemble a Shar-Pei from the chin downwards---this was not due to weight loss.    I have lost all of the fat in my face.    During the past year I have been experiencing    severe short- and long-term memory problems, have lost much of my vocabulary, and am having trouble performing some simple tasks such as opening containers, connecting (e.g.) USB extension cables, and following written and verbal instructions.    This spring I was found to have a solid benign golfball-sized nodule on my thyroid, which is NOT affecting thyroid function. At the time, the sternomastoid muscle near the nodule was swollen about a third of the way up my neck; that swelling has now reached my ear.    (I visited an ENT specialist recently, as recommended by my endocrinologist; this caring fellow---his first words, after I√¢ Ä ôd explained briefly what was going on, were √¢ Ä òWhat do you want ME to do for you?√¢ Ä ô---looked up my nose, in my ears, and down my throat, felt my neck; I asked him why the muscle on my neck was swollen.    He said he didn√¢ Ä ôt know, that he couldn√¢ Ä ôt help me, and left the exam room.)    Though my pulse rate is usually normal, my heartbeat feels more like a pounding, which is causing me a great deal of discomfort (my blood pressure is normal).    I have no energy.    My temperature is often elevated, though I have no infections that I am aware of.    And for many years my face, neck and arms have been covered with lesions.    These are not pimples (I have tried every prescription and non-prescription skin preparation on the market, and nothing has had ANY effect on them).    These lesions erupted spontaneously form scalp to knees over a period of three days; it is only during the past five years that they have been concentrated on my face and neck---they used to heal just as spontaneously.    Now they never heal√¢ Ä ¶    I√¢ Ä ôve BEGGED dermatologists to biopsy these lesions and they have REFUSED!     I have no idea whether the skin lesions are related in any way to the symptoms that have appeared during the last two and a half years.I√¢ Ä ôve become a freak.    I have not left the house in two years except to visit specialists, who for the most part have shooed me out of their offices (average time spent in the exam rooms: ten minutes).    The experience I described with the ENT specialist is typical. Interestingly, the two that didn√¢ Ä ôt dismiss me out of hand were female doctors---but I can√¢ Ä ôt say that even they tried terribly hard to find out what is going on.    I feel as if I am trying to get a vet to examine a cockroach, and that I have become so hideous in the past two years that even doctors (the male ones, anyway) do not even regard me as a person. They don√¢ Ä ôt want to hear, they don√¢ Ä ôt want to see.    Apparently they do not think there is anything WORTH salvaging.I have been all over the Internet looking for a rare-diseases site with an advanced symptom-checker feature, but such a site, as far as I know, doesn√¢ Ä ôt exist---and the descriptions of rare conditions are so brief that they are useless to me.    As I don√¢ Ä ôt have anything communicable, I can only assume that I have a rare genetic disease.SOMEWHERE there must be a database into which someone can enter five or ten symptoms and at the very least narrow down the list of conditions that might be causing the symptoms.    Does anyone know of such a database, and how to access it?Or is there a doctor reading this forum who can give me a clue as to what is happening to me?Please do not advise me to go to the NIH, a university hospital, the Mayo Clinic, etc.    I cannot afford it.    And even if I could, I could very well end up in the office of another doctor who thinks the world is a reality show/beauty contest and that diagnosing or treating a disfigured middle-aged woman isn√¢ Ä ôt worth his while."

"146"	"1426610"	"Aug 26, 2010"	"Hello;I am new to this community and could not find a specific thyroid expert forum so I apologize for asking here. i have a condition called Peripheral Resistance to Thyroid Hormone with severe hypothyroidism that does not respond to medication. I am female, 32 y.o. and was affected by Chernobyl fallout at the age of 10 and had a bad case of Mono at 11, and heavy metal poisoning as a teenager while working in art school. My mother had symptoms of hypothyroidism all her life (multiple miscarriages, infertility, chronic pain, hair loss, fatigue etc.) and my aunt has a nodular goiter with hypothyroidism. I had problems with cold intolerance, hair loss, weakness all my life but in 2007 due to sudden onset of body swelling along with all these symptoms was discovered to be hypothyroid. I was treated with T4 for a while and it helped with all my symptoms but after an accidental overdose with T4-T3 combination drug I had a very brief thyroid storm and most of my tissues became resistant to thyroid hormone. My symptoms became progressively worse and include drastic facial skin thickening leading to progressive deformity, severe hands and feet edema (permanent), confusion and disorientation spells, severe electrolyte deficiencies, overall body swelling, fast hair loss, I can't walk without a cane and sometimes fall, have muscle wasting and pain, hearing loss and constant blurry vision; electrolyte deficiencies almost killed me a few times (Potassium drops cased seizures and inability to move). I become lethargic and don't know where I am when it gets colder, and swell up immediately when it gets a little bit warmer outside. My blood    tests indicate incorrect response to T3 in different tissues. I am completely disabled, on Medi-Cal and financially lost everything I had due to illness. My boyfriend is struggling to help me. We have failed to find help locally as most endocrinologists don't know anything about such cases, as those who do don't take insurance. We are asking if anyone knows what tests we need to do if we can to find out the cause of my resistance. My tests show the pattern similar to the patients with thyroid receptor mutation that runs in the families or sometimes can be caused by other factors like radiation exposure, and we suspect this is the case. Please help us, if you can. Thank you in advance;Maria."

We are waiting to see a heart specialist also as he has a vascular ring (double aortic arch) which needs surgery. Due to the discovery of the DAA they have tested for digeorge 2 weeks ago and awaiting results, they have some tests back for Calcium and they are fine, also done lympocytes and collectively the figures are fine and they progressed to do a T and B cell split, all has come back fine except something to do with a lower cell 8 count, when he said lower apparently they benchmark the reading against healthy children of a similar age. in our case a 16MO, there wasnt an exact match though for his age so they tested on an older child and it was lower in comparison to an older child. My consultant says not to worry and its not low enough to warrant intervention but its low enough to repeat the test in say a years time. has anyone got any further information on this and what cell 8 does specifically. The reason he was put in ICU in the beginning is that he got paraflu, im worried incase the reason that it affected him so bad is that his immunity is low, if that was the case surely he would need intervention now to replace the low count."

I am 19 years old and a freshman in college. Late in high school, I finally decided to do something about how I looked about twelve years old. I went to an endocrinologist who finally prescribed me IM testosterone shots for delayed puberty, which i took for six months. It was enough to jump start a growth spurt which sent me from 5'8\" at the beginning on the treatment to almost six feet (over the course of these two years, the bulk of the spurt happened the year of the testosterone treatment).Now, let me lay out the problems which I want to do something about now. Puberty has been progressing smoothly in all areas except facial hair. I have body hair (except chest hair hah) so it seems facial hair is the only lacking aspect of pubertal development. The only place that hair is noticeable is on my upper lip, and even there it is weak.my other problem is that it seems during this growth spurt that my head did not grow with my body. I have a disproportionally small head for my body. The circumference of my head is roughly 54-55 cm on my 150 lb, 5'11\" body. As you can imagine it looks and makes me feel strange.I've been doing research on these problems to find solutions to them. It seems that I can kill two birds with one stone by taking androgens, such as testosterone or DHT. I have another appointment which my endocrinologist in about a week so I will try to get my testosterone prescription renewed, but I wanted to check in here because the research I've done so far is hardly relevant to my problems and the answers remain cloudy.I am also looking into getting hGH, IGF-1, or IGF-1 lr3, because of the known effects of these on skull/bone growth. And these wouldn't have the same effect on producing facial hair, but also would not cause hair loss like it is rumored dht does. What about pGH?My main problem is head size. I can deal with waiting for more facial hair. If we prioritize skull/jaw growth, what would you recommend I take? Testosterone? will DHT solve my problems at the cost of hair loss? hGH or IGF? Something completely different? I tried to do as much research as I could before coming here so I could intelligently discuss this, but i ran into a dead end and really need dialogue with professionals now.Thanks so much, I hope to hear from you soon!"

I have a question, and I would be very grateful for your reply. I am a mother of nine month-old son. A child born in the 39 weeks of gestation, the forces of nature, has 9 points in the scale Appgar. After birth, was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. The doctors noticed dysmorfism features of the face, decreased muscle tone, underdeveloped penis, foot clubfoot. The child has undergone heart surgery. In the meantime, has been done to assess its karyotype, which showed chromosomal aberration. Then performed additional testing of the child, my husband and the FISH method, after which his son was found in the following drawback: 46, XY, der(6)t(6;8)(p25;p22)pat. Unfortunately, the geneticists could not tell us what are associated with this defect. Overall, we were informed that at present aberracjach facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies and developmental delay. After some time the doctor suggested us to make a study of the clinical use of microarrays CGX-12. We were told that after this trial the doctors determine exactly which genes have been translocated, and then it will connect in the case of our son. We waited for the results of 5 months. In the end we had an appointment at the clinic and what we heard? The fact that doctors do not tell us! I must admit that I am disappointed because we were promised some interesting results. I do not understand why doctors can not say anything, since geneticists know which genes are on different chromosomes, and for which those genes are responsible. For me it is not logical.We have received just such a result: the genetic material was considered a change of the nature of chromosome aberrations (deletions and duplications). Change is detected at the terminal deletion of chromosome pair 6 (region 6p25.3 - 6p25.1, the size of deletions - 5.20 - 5.23 Mb, according to genomic position HG18 128,203 - 5,462,343) and a terminal duplication of chromosome pair 8 (region 8p23.3 - 8p22, the size of duplication - 15.26 - 15.49 Mb; genomic position by HG18: 192262 - 15451730). Submicroscopic chromosome rearrangements are a frequent cause of intellectual disability, behavioral disorders and congenital malformations. The test result confirms the genetic link of the disease. ACGH study using the NimbleGen 135k chips CGX-12 allows the identification of changes submicroscopic    located in regions of the genome rich in genes of more than 20 - 100 kb.That's why I write here. Looking for any information found on the web results (except U.S.), which described patients with similar defects. I must admit that this article I learned a lot more than the doctors.

The ability to test for micro-deletions and duplications can be considered as still in its infancy, just recently borne out of the past decade.    Therefore, very little information is currently available about what they are finding on these tests.    It's important to remember that Genetic testing, in comparison to other sciences and medicines, is a fairly new method of approaching health care, and what can be identified in a scientific laboratory setting does not necessarily translate into medical understanding.The human genome with all its complexity has the potential for an infinite possibility of variations: duplications and deletions can now be detected and reported, but with no historical basis for comparison, interpreting the existence of these chromosomal variations remains a challenge.    Oftentimes abnormal results don't lead to any answers at all simply due to the fact that many of these results are new findings.    Not necessarily that the condition never existed before, simply that it was never documented -- the technology simply did not exist. Think of CMA testing where it is today as akin to the finding of the Rosetta stone:    we can see the stone and identify the markings, but we are unable to understand what it means due to a lack of reference.It is surely frustrating to be do test after test that yields no helpful answers, only more questions.    The only encouragement that I can offer those who are struggling with these concerns is that as genetic understanding continues to advance, identifying and collecting the information gained by such testing is the path by which science can arrive at answers in the future. The information may be an enigma today, but it may lead to understanding and answers for those affected now and in the future.Best wishes to all."

I would REALLY appreciate some help understanding what the consultant told me, so I will give a little background to my condition first:About 2 years ago I started to feel tightness in my calf muscles at a time when I was playing semi professional football. This tightness quite quickly reached a level which meant that I had to quit the sport. Since then my legs have become more and more dysfunctional meaning that I have gone from being able to still play low excecise sport, to where I am now, struggling to even walk.In the 1st year I had many different treatments including: physio, acupuncture, orthopedic shoe implants and spinal and brain MRI scans. None of these tests / treatments either helped or found anything.At the end of last year I saw a neorologist and he did some tests including and EMG in January. On the basis of these tests I was told that I had a neurological condition that was affecting the messages sent from the brain to my legs and that this was a genetical condition. The consultant said that the existence of constant leg muscle twitching also compounds that diagnosis. I was told that the the challenge for them now is to find out what condition this is. I have no speech problems (something that they keep asking me about) but my legs are getting worse on a daily basis and the twitches have now extended to my stomach, back and arms.I had the second test yesterday and the consultant said that he would write up his report and then call me back to discuss, but that it may be that I need to have another test in 4 months to help understand    the evolution of the this problem! He did tell me that my legs have \"changed considerably\" since January but that there hasn't been \"much change\" in my arms.I am stressing out about this because I don't know what my condition might be, I have idea what the prognosis could be and the consultants are reluctant to suggest anything until they know for sure. This leaves me in a position where I am struggling to move around on a daily basis to the extent that I fall over at least once every two days, and this is seriously damaging my confidence and mental state! I feel that if my legs keep regressing at this rate I will be in a wheelchair by the end of the year - I really need to know what is happening to me.I really appreciate any help and guidance that you may be able to provide, so thatnkyou in advance for any kind advice.Scott"	"0"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

I have a negative thumb sign (which means my thumb does not extend beyond my clenched fist) but a near-positive wrist sign. My arm span is 6'2, my actual height is 5'11 1/2. However, my armspan to height ratio is only 1.03, under the 1.05 limit people say for Marfan's. I do have long arms and somewhat spidery fingers. I had an echocardiogram 2 years ago and it came back normal. I do look tall and thin, but My doctor thought I might just have characteristics of Marfans and not have the actual disorder. Might this be the case? Do I have Marfan's or just symptoms of it. Like I said, no major heart problems ever in my life up to now. Thanks to whoever might give me clarity."

"146"	"1504275"	"Feb 22, 2011"	"Hello,I am hoping you all may have some answers or insight on this topic.My mother's side of the family has a long history of an unknown and definitely genetic disorder that occurs most commonly in the women on our side of the family. What I have found:On my mom's side of the family, the women develop a problem around the age of 45 that my mom describes as \"just being so incredibly sick\". They are unable to hold their heads up or get out of bed or eat or swallow. My mom's mother died of \"heart disease\" very soon after that. My mom saw an infinite number of gastroenterologists before finally being given an SSRI. She was skeptical, but it worked. My mother has mitral valve prolapse, collagenous colitis (at least, that's what it seems like), has dislocated both of her shoulders, and has had poor eyesight for her entire life but has had worsening night vision over the years and was diagnosed this month with color blindness (only one color, and it's definitely brand new). My mom's brother developed cataracts around the age of 45, has severe acid reflux, is extremely thin, and has a stutter (like his dad did).I personally have been diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (it was diagnosed while I was on Adderall(adderrall), so I'm not sure what the real diagnosis should be), mitral valve prolapse, and IBS. I had shoulder surgery at 15 and osteochronditis dissicans at 8. I am allergic to almost every antibiotic and had a lot of food allergies as a kid which disappeared (not the antibiotic allergies). I think I am especially susceptible to bacterial infections. As a kid, I almost always had a sinus infection (doctors would comment on the appearance of my nasal cavity) and I had strep every month for a year until I got my tonsils out (and then I only got it around twice a year). At 19 I developed a pretty bad staph infection that was in my fingernail, in my wrist, in my scalp, in my mouth, and I think in my connective tissue (as indicated by petechia, bruising, red puffy lines under my eyes, severe muscle pain, etc.)My hair is also getting lighter, but I don't know if that's relevant. (Not lighter from the sun, I promise.)I am currently on medical leave. I am extremely suspicious that I have a connective tissue disorder, but I'm not sure. My aunt has Crohns, her daughter has mitral valve prolapse, etc etc etc.I noticed the other day when the sun was really bright in the mirror that I have these shiny yellow/gold rings on the outer edge of my iris. I don't think I have Wilson's disease, but they are really shiny and weren't there before. My mom has them as well (I checked with a flashlight) but hers are much more full looking. None of us have liver problems (besides my uncle, but he's an alcoholic).I am experiencing problems with severe back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, elbow pain, and bone pain (forearms, lower legs). Ibuprofen helps but promethazine helps more. I have been experiencing floaters more than usual (but I've had a lot of them ever since I was a kid). I see flashing lights since I was 15, and experience every symptom of transient ischemic attacks besides the paralysis. I attribute this to my orthostatic problems which cause my cranial pressure to get too low.Anyway, please contribute if you have any ideas."

After a lifetime of medical complaints (various autoimmune symptoms or dx plus major fatigue and periods of brain fog and severe atrial fibrillaiton)    we all had micronutrient testing recently. My daughter and I both had alarming results, with severe deficiencies (my son's were disconcerting but not as bad). My dd also had high levels of toxins in her system. These toxins were all things she has either no    exposure to or much less than the average person. her report suggested they can also come from undigested amino acids stagnating in her fats and becoming toxic. My tests showed deficiencies in numrous areas. both reports suggested all the logical anticipted remedies, if our lifestyle habits are bad, but said that if those don't work to refer us to a center that specializes in congenital    metabolic defects. Our GP told us this is out of her expertise, so she made an appointment to consult with doctors from the lab (Genova Diagnostics). It took a while to get one, but I believe that appointment happens this week. Meanwhile, my dd has gotten very sick with a bug, and slept 24 hours a day for 2 weeks, and is still very weak a week later. Blood tests showed low white blood cells (absolute neutrophills, 1316 L, absolute lymphocytes, 363 L & absolute bosinophils 2 L) and she was hypothroid. She turns 16 next week. We are waiting preliminary test results to rule out now    Lupus, whch her paternal grandmotehr and great uncle died of, and leukemia which her maternal great aunt and my cousin died of. Both my children have been dxed with generalized anxiety with mild OCD. My son has a long history of mood disorders (he also falls in the exceptionally/profoundly gifted range, and mood/personality disorders are common with that population). I have such severe a-fib that nurses have told me they've never seen anyone with my EKG be responsive, however our standard blood panel is usually close to ideal. My first grade school nurse was adamant that my brother and I were malnourished, but bloodwork 'proved' her wrong. However, I have never felt well and alert, and have lookd for someone to look deeper than those blood tests my whole life.My doctor believes we have a genetic disorder that blocks absorption of protein and fats. Not just the three of us. Most of my relatives who descended from my paternal grandfather share our medical history, and some have gotten seriously ill and died from autoimmune disorders such as leukemia, ALS, colon cancer. Nearly all of us are hypothyroid and have atrial fibrillation. at least three have had Alzheimers, and most of us had early onset migraines. Our most common body type is very tall, very thin (underweight) until age 30, and then rapid weight gain. There are several suspected and a few confirmed cases of mental illness. We are a tiny family (fewer than 150 people with my maiden name have been born worldwide since 1900), from a tiny island ( 25 km square). this makes it    quite possible we have a very rare condition, perhaps never identified.My doctor supports my researching this and that is what I have been trying to do, but most cases I find of metabolic disorders show up in newborns. Our family is outdoorsy and most members appear robust, with few diagnosed serious illnesses, other than one baby that got leukemia at 6 months.Any suggestions or ideas as to what this might be or where to begin searching?Many thanks"	"0"	"malabsorption,metabolic disorders,congenital,Genetics"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

Then, she tells me my risk for Trisomy 13 & 18 was 1 in 57. I was scheduled for a Level 2 Ultrasound this afternoon and they measured the fluid at the back of the baby's neck and there's too much fluid. The bladder is 3x bigger than what it's supposed to be. Now I have a 1 in 5 chance for a baby with Trisomy 13 or 18. My options? Do nothing. Wait until I'm 15 weeks to do an amnio. Or do a CVS which is similiar to an amnio. I opted to do the CVS because I could do it today. They stuck a huge needle in my stomach and took some of the tissue from the placenta. My risk for miscarriage for doing the procedure was 1 in 100. I now have to wait 7-10 days for the results which will tell us everything we need to know chromosomally.

Finally I was cleared to begin breastfeeding her again and she stopped. She completely recovered leaving doctors baffled until about 6 months old I noticed she was not developing normal. I startedbaby food and projectile vomitting came back with a vengeance    She was diagnose as failure to thrive    became so ill she spent more time inpainent at Duke diagnosed with this and that then told no that is why sent home overage over with no answers Doctors said they didn't know but keep doing what I was doing. One time there an it saw her and wanted to do a swallow test    turned out she was inhaling food and drink and causing her to develop pneumonia.

I have a question, and I would be very grateful for your reply. I am a mother of nine month-old son. A child born in the 39 weeks of gestation, the forces of nature, has 9 points in the scale Appgar. After birth, was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. The doctors noticed dysmorfism features of the face, decreased muscle tone, underdeveloped penis, foot clubfoot. The child has undergone heart surgery. In the meantime, has been done to assess its karyotype, which showed chromosomal aberration. Then performed additional testing of the child, my husband and the FISH method, after which his son was found in the following drawback: 46, XY, der(6)t(6;8)(p25;p22)pat. Unfortunately, the geneticists could not tell us what are associated with this defect. Overall, we were informed that at present aberracjach facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies and developmental delay. After some time the doctor suggested us to make a study of the clinical use of microarrays CGX-12. We were told that after this trial the doctors determine exactly which genes have been translocated, and then it will connect in the case of our son. We waited for the results of 5 months. In the end we had an appointment at the clinic and what we heard? The fact that doctors do not tell us! I must admit that I am disappointed because we were promised some interesting results. I do not understand why doctors can not say anything, since geneticists know which genes are on different chromosomes, and for which those genes are responsible. For me it is not logical.We have received just such a result: the genetic material was considered a change of the nature of chromosome aberrations (deletions and duplications). Change is detected at the terminal deletion of chromosome pair 6 (region 6p25.3 - 6p25.1, the size of deletions - 5.20 - 5.23 Mb, according to genomic position HG18 128,203 - 5,462,343) and a terminal duplication of chromosome pair 8 (region 8p23.3 - 8p22, the size of duplication - 15.26 - 15.49 Mb; genomic position by HG18: 192262 - 15451730). Submicroscopic chromosome rearrangements are a frequent cause of intellectual disability, behavioral disorders and congenital malformations. The test result confirms the genetic link of the disease. ACGH study using the NimbleGen 135k chips CGX-12 allows the identification of changes submicroscopic    located in regions of the genome rich in genes of more than 20 - 100 kb.That's why I write here. Looking for any information found on the web results (except U.S.), which described patients with similar defects. I must admit that this article I learned a lot more than the doctors.

On the genetic side, neither my family or my boyfriend's family has any history of this. I have alot of questions running through my head. What all exactly am I looking at? Like, when it comes to talking to the genetic counselor and if something is wrong with my baby. What exactly causes this to happen? Is it cause my babies are to close at age?

But the \"problem\" is that if geneA has a high expression then geneB had an low expression, and vise versa.In some tissues we see that both genes have expression but then neither of them are as high as when only one of them was really active.I am beginning to think that maybe two highly expressing genes cannot be to close to each other and be \"maximum active\" at the same time?Maybe the unwinding and processing of the DNA for geneA will make it hard for geneB to be treated the same way because of the small distance?Thank you for your time, this is my first time I write at a forum like this and my english is not the best.Thanks for answer!/Anders"	"0"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

This is my first pregnancy. I had my CAS on my 20th week and they found a choroid plexus cyst on the left part of the brain. My OB-Sonologist recommended that we do a follow up scan every 2 weeks to monitor the cyst. On my 30th week, the choroid plexus cyst was gone but she found that the baby has an enlarged cisterna magna instead in the left. There are no other anomalies found. I also underwent Biophysical Score for my baby and the same result was found - enlarged cisterna magna. I tried to check the internet what this means because this was not fully discussed by my OB-Gynecologist. I am now worried because most explanations I read about enlarged cisterna magna relates it to high risk of Trisomy 18, 13 and Hydrocephalus and a high risk of fetal mortality. Ultrasound result showed that I am conceiving a baby boy. I also had premature contractions recently so I had to be in complete bed rest.Can you please enlighten me about this.

The thing is, I really want the potential of a thick, full grown beard. I started to look for products that could possibly enhance my facial hair growth. After doing a bit of research on the internet about facial hair and learned that there was no safe bet on any products that could enhance my hair growth capabilities. Testosterone, Rogaine, and other types of oils and such weren't the answer. In fact, I learned that the only major factor in facial hair growth was genetics, which is what brought me here in the first place.SO, that got me thinking... Well, my father is able to grow facial hair, so is my brother (only 2 1/2 years older than me). My brother was able to grow thick, full sideburns by the time he was 15/16. I am now 18 and STILL can't grow to the potential he can. He is now about to turn 21 and for the most part he can grow a full beard, besides his mustache which isn't nearly as thick as the rest of his facial hair. Maybe we have different levels of testosterone, I thought. He has always been an adrenaline junkie, the jock and all that. On the other hand, I've always been more settle, an artist you might say. Although I did play sports throughout my childhood years and up through high school. So does exercise and physical activity play a role? Does it increase your testosterone levels that also enhance your hair growth?Since we are brothers, born of the same mother and father, why does my brother have the ability to grow more facial hair than I do?

My 7 year old son is seeing many doctors who are trying to figure out what is wrong with him. He is 7 years old, he is not on the growth chart for height or weight. He has basically quit growing as of 17 months ago but his growth has slowed down over the years. As a baby he was in the 75th percentile. His left leg is clinically shorter than his right, he has PDD-NOS, he has a benign tumor removed from his eye last month, has surgery starting the 23 MAY for bilateral undescended testicles, the dentist confirmed that his adult teeth are behind at least by 3-4 years and is not sure if they are still forming, he is getting a biopsy on his penis for another growth similar to his eye. He has seen a Endocrine team at UNC and they said that he is producing the hormones to grow so there is nothing more they can do for him. He is scheduled to see a gentic doctor in July among other doctors. He has had over 50 appts in three months and I am so tired of hearing \" We just do not know\". They believe he has a syndrome but do not know what kind. Has anyone experienced anything like this?? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"

My husband and I were both just asked to have chromosonal testing done as our son (our second child together, my third child) was diagnosed with 4 and 10 balanced translocation as he was genetically tested in the NICU as he was 6 weeks premature and had respiratory issues.    I am just learning of this and we dont know yet if my husband and or I carry this as well, so far at 8 months old he is meeting al his milestones, and our daughter who is 22 months is also on tract, although very petite (22lbs).    I have read in some forums that this can cause predisposition for certain cancers, mental retardation and schizophrenia and or problems for his ability to have children in the future as well :( We also wanted to have another child when our son was 2, should we not risk it if this might happen again, he is 31 and so am I, we will be 32 when we try to concieve(conceive)again, if we choose..any information you can give me is well appreciated!"

My onset of problems presented as extreme iron deficiency and with more testing discovered folic acid,b6 and 12 deficiencies.    After several rounds of iv iron and continued problems my hematologist ran this test and presented me with this diagnosis, gave me folic in high doses and went ahead and scheduled me for my next round of iv iron ,which I am having to replace more and more often.    It began at 2 yr intervals and we are now doing the iv iron every four months.    Needless to say I am not thrilled with this arrangement and am desperate to \"just go back to being me without having to be *topped off*\"    Rambling, sorry, so, I am thinking that if the HRT is working to reverse the side effects of menopause ... then why couldn't it reverse this process as well .. and has anyone tried??

She's had multiple health issues since birth and currently deals with low muscle tone, chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction, autonomic dysregulation, fatigue, poor vision, neuropathy and autistic traits.    She is feeding tube dependent through a GJ tube, and does occasionally eat by mouth.    She is cognitively normal.        When she becomes sick with anything, even a minor cold, all of her symptoms increase ten fold and we usually end up inpatient.    She always has odd basic metabolic labs, such as co2 getting lower even after being well hydrated with IV fluids.    Sugars sometimes drop during illness, especially if we lose the ability to feed her.    She was found to have a deletion in her microarray that is not concretely known to be associated with anything specific, though is often found as an autism loci.    Well amino acid panel and urine organic acids revealed nothing.    So our geneticist requested we do sick labs.    We've had two sets.    First set revealed dycarboxilic aciduria, but blood amino acids were normal.    The most recent set were done with a minor sinus thing and asthma flare but she acted much sicker than basic labs would have suggested.    The blood amino acid panel revealed 12 significant lows and a high plasma lactic acid.    The urine organic acid panel revealed 7 significant highs.    The day she was tested for these, we were sent home she was sick but holding her own and feeds were going at the usual rate.    During that night, her gastric drainage increased dramatically, and we were not able to keep up with her feeds and she was admitted.    Labs that day of admission revealed mildly low blood sugar of 60, low co2, elevated liver enzymes (not hugely elevated though) and a few other off things.    Fluids and gut rest for three days then restarting feeds and she was back to herself though weak.I know that often the blood amino acids are looked for to reveal high levels of amino acids.    I can't find any info on low levels, especially of several lows and how that relates to the high levels.    Both lab reports have been faxed to our geneticist, but it will be a few days before I hear from him I'm sure.    The blood panel reads \"Suggests low protein intake (there is no way it's related to low protein intake as not sick these labs are normal), but multiple lows would suggest that urine organic acid testing be done to further investigate the potential for inborn errors of metabolism\"    and then the urine organic acid talks about dycarboxlic aciduria along with the prescence of other elevated acids could indicate fatty acid oxidation disorders, diets of medium chain triglycerides and ketogenic disorders.\"She doesn't seem to fit the picture of any of those, especially to have gotten to her age without any cognitive issues.    But, I always assumed that with mitochondrial diseases, the levels would be high for both blood and urine.Any ideas how multiple lows play into metabolic issues?"

I miscarried last year in October at around 8 weeks after seeing no heart beat. Then I had one bio chemical pregnancy this year in June. I conceived again in November, my hcg levels were almost 10,000 at 4 weeks. We had our first scan at 6 weeks and could see the heart beat at 103 bpm, the technician said its low. Also, one of her observations was that the gestational sac is bigger than yolk sac by 2 weeks and is measuring 8 weeks. We did a follow up at 8 weeks and discovered that the heart beat dropped to 74 bpm and embryo was still measuring only 6 weeks which meant the growth stopped. My doc asked me to take hcg shot, start progesterone tablets, aspirin and also continue my frolic acid which I have been taking. She asked us to do a follow up in a week,s time which was on Dec 31. We went for a follow scan and found that the heart beat went up to 106 which I know is very low for 9 weeks and the embryo size corresponds to 6 weeks which mean no growth for last 3 weeks. Also, they saw 2 sacs this time and the technician said this is not normal so heart rate 106 bpm, 2 yolk sac like structures and 1 heart beat with no growth.they have asked us to wait for 10 more days and then go for D & C. I was really hopeful this time :-( last time also they could see 2 sac like structure out of that one was the yolk sac , no one knows about the other.My doc doubts if it has to do with some genetic abnormality.

I feel like there is some vein going from my neck to my    foot that is affected....because I get this weird pain in my achiles heel...sometimes my hip... and near my right shoulder that feels more like it has to do with nerves than OUCH type of pain...its a weakening type of pain but its not always there....sometimes the right side of my back gets a 'tingly' feeling. and I feel like when I use my back the only side I am aware of is the left...my right side isn't completly numb but to a degree its almost like its not being used which causes pain.I lifted weights while I had this problem and my right side just WOULD NOT match up to my left no matter how hard I tried and thats how I found out about this issue really.Sometimes I feel like the right side of my body is dying....its kind of an intuitive feeling...I can stile play basketball and lift weights and all that (which I dont because I feel like I need to rest all the time) I can walk normal and am still more athletically heatheir than your average person I would say...but Im a bit afraid of losing mobility...I am not afraid of death..I am afraid of living with a    big dissablility.ALL in ALL:Left side noticably bigger than right from my head to my private parts (I am male) to my feet.Slight numbness/weakness in right side of bodyPain in the achiles heal shoulder and hip on occassion.back paintingly feeling on right side of body ocassionallyjust an overall feeling of imbalance.Now, I am posting here to get as much advice I can for free...my issue right now is I CAN AFFORD A DOCTOR...I can afford a checkup thats about it but right now I am in Costa rica and I will have to drive 8 hrs to san jose to get a checkup and that costs alot.My main questions:What are the Do nots? what should I avoid at all costs?What can I do that doesn't involve going to a doctor that can help? (I love yoga and practice about 3 times a week or less due to this issue getting worse. I have lower back pain due to lifting weights and pulling my back (with a leg discrepancy) Also my right knee feels very weak and vulnerable while doing yoga..it easily hyper extends.How serious are the issues Im having and if I do not go to a doctor what are the risks?How can I get financal help with this problem?

A lumbar puncture and it came back ok... I just couldnt believe that so i pushed and pushed until they did another test i had the help of my ophtalmolpgist because sebastian was now having atrophy nerve in his eyes which led to some pressure in te brain! So they did another test and this one was directly in the brain... He was at 19 pressure and normaly it's at 10 so he had some pressure they did the shunt... He still has bulging fontanelles and they still didnt close ! His head circ is 56 cm and he weights 11kg 74 cmlong ...

However, I have serious memory issues relating to episodic memory, or memory of events I have lived through. The memory issues can start as early as a month or so from the date of occurrence but are far worse once a couple of years go by. I used to do plays in high school and cannot remember now (at age 25) having been in them at all, except \"knowing\" that I did them and having a few photographs. Similarly, I am already forgetting things (walks, movies, etc.) I did with my boyfriend of only 8 months. This kind of memory issue is very strange because it sort of rips away good and bad memories. I had depression during college (possibly BPD) but this issue has been happening for my entire life since I was a child. If anyone has read studies on this I would be very interested to see what it may be caused by. Thank you."

I have POTS, an ASD, mitral valve prolapse, polycystic ovary, endometriosis, peripheral neuropathy, HORRIBLE circulation, ehlers danlos syndrome (classical), hyperreactive joints and anxiety (since I was younger).I am almost 23, female obviously, and just had my first baby at 22. I have had two surgeries that took place September and December 2009 (1: laparoscopy, hysteriscopy + dnc. 2: a tumor removed off of my coccyx as well as the last 2 vertebrae).After these, I had horrible hemorrhaging, severe weight loss because of vommitting violently 20 minutes after every meal and could not have bowel movements for WEEKS at a time, even laxatives and the pre-colonoscopy liquid medicine didn't help. My kidneys and intestines started shutting down/not moving. Lasics helped my kidneys but my intestines only started BARELY moving ( went a moth and a half with only 2 bowel movements).A year After I had my son, I completely changed my diet to a very healthy diet as well as stopped drinking any caffiene, sodas, or alcohol unless special ocassions (and even ten maybe one glass of wine, two at most). Around this time I started getting (everything all around same time and it progresses slowly over time, now it's much worse than when it all started): extreme pressure in my head feeling like my eyes would pop out, rushing sounds in my ears, vertigo, heavy and tight feeling chest, many times my heart felt like it was bruised because te faster itd beat, the more painful it was, hard to breathe with the smallest amount of exertion, loss of appetite, feeling completely weak and collapsing, memory lapse, dazing spells, black/purple feet and hands always cold with tingling, constant numbness, pressure in my arteries in my arms like someone was holding in a bad spot, always tired, swelling in left calf (which I thought was from my varicose veins in my inner thighs), muscle spasms everywhere, constant tremmors in my hands, extreme confusion, clumsines, aching all over life i have the flu, low grade fevers, migraines (which I've never had),higher blood pressure than normal (both diastolic and systolic) even with a very healthy diet, aching all the time, dizziness, bruises all over my body for no reason at all and much more common than before pregnancy, more tachycardic than normal, stiff and very sore back and neck, blacking out, sharp pains in chest and stomach, passing out and hard time urinating sometimes while other times I can't even feel when I have to urinate, I have to rely on the pressure or when my pants get too tight.My neurologist (which seems to not believe me) ordered an MRI, EEG and b12 testing. All apparently came out negative for anything. She was very rude (which I've shadowed plenty specialists and know some have their days, but telling me I'm absent minded and my geneticist doesn't know what she's talking about diagnosing me with EDS is extremely poor bedside manners). I have done things that aren't just \"forgetfulness\" that I can't remember doing minutes later and they are extremely important, some could have negatively affected my child if my husband didn't pay attention, which a couple were when I fed my son and took off his tray (which I never do) and walked out of the room as well as another time I almost gave him medicine 5 minutes after I had already given him medicine. I am ADHD so I know what forgetfulness is and this is not the case.My neurologist told my pcp that she suspected MS but had told me everything was fine and thought it was in my head. I am pre-med and my pcp has even called my father saying she will back me up any day and she'll do whatever it takes to figure this out because every time I have felt \"off\" no one but my pcp was persistent in figuring out the cause. The results were always something rare or that needed treatment.I'm very worried my neurologist is just going to write me off like many others and I know stress has many similar debilitating symptoms but not all of mine. My pcp knows I'm not stressed or depressed and is treating my anxiety properly. I have gotten through college at a private school who tells their students not to expect to do as well as they desire to because they try to sift people out. I made wonderful grades and didn't even know I was ADHD until junior year so needless to say I worked my butt off. If I wasn't overly stressed then, then I certainly am not now. All other problems are being treated with medication.I JUST can't and won't be Okay with raising my son knowing I could harm him. My husband won't even let me drive him anymore, and I understand why. I just need some insight, if possible.I do have very bad bruising, worse than before symptoms started, and I know manynof these sound like lupus (I have a step cousin with lupus) and I do have a 2nd cousin with Lou gherrigs disease as well. Please please please give me any type of insight possible.I know you can't possibly diagnose me, but some possibilities I can have in mind so I can approach my neurologist or pcp with ideas would be fantastic and helpful. I am a genetics fanatic and have tried to approach it through family history, turning up at a dead end. Thank you so much!Jordan"	"2"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

All 3 pregnancies were lost at 7 weeks exactly. Not 7w 1d, 6w 6d, 7 weeks 0 days on the dot. My husband and I think I miscarried in February 2011, but aren't sure as I never did have a positive pregnancy test, yet was late enough that it should've caught something. (I know withing a 24 hour time frame of when I will start, and am rarely off schedule.)I take a prenatal vitamin daily as it makes me feel better than a regular multivitamin. I've read that some of the B vitamins are good to take, along with your regular vitamins, but what else is out there that I could take to help?Could my daughter hearing disability be related to the MTHFR? I have always credited my regular physician (prior to moving out of state) for saving my pregnancy - I had gone in because I wasn't feeling well, had a negative pregnancy test (urine test and blood test), was diagnosed with strep throat with a touch of the flu, and sent on my way with meds. I was told to come back in 10 days, so I did, and that's when I was told I was pregnant. I honestly believe that doctor saved my baby girl. I was about 5-6 weeks along when I was prescribed the meds.None of my doctors in the past had ever really cared about my losses, or seemed like they cared. I met this doctor, and he's amazing. He looked so angry when I told him about my history, and he promised he would find out what was going on. It took 4 months for the test results to come back, but he's helped a ton.Sorry I'm rambling. I'm just so confused, sad, upset, angry, you name it.I'm young - just turned 28 a few days ago.Is there anyone out there who has been through this? That has gone on to have healthy, happy babies? That could give me advice, pointers, anything?Thanks a million in advance."

I was expecting it to be too low and i found It was super high around 180/90. so I have been checking lately and though the second number seems to be more normal /80 the first is consistently over 160. I dont know where this is coming from. I dont feel over stressed or anything. I really dont know what this means..my dad has high bp but not this bad!.I don't want to alarm anyone until I figure out that this is something to be concerned about. -A little worried."

She rates a 5/9 on the beighton scale but were not sure if her knees go back far enough so it might be 7/9.

( he is now 5 months old. He seems to be having trouble holding himself up when on his belly. We don't have much information and are awaiting genetic testing because he also has \" rocker bottom feet\"    not a severe case butwe have already been to a neurological doctor and are in physical therapy. ANY info would be helpful. He seems to also favor his right side. The physical therapy is to stretch his neck muscles and leg muscles on the left side. The neurological doctor has said it is not cerebral palsy and sent us for genetic tests. Has anyone else dealt with or has any similar experiences. I am worried and can find no information. Thank you in advance. -Melissa"	"1"	"None"	"Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,"

For the past six months or so, her elbows and shoulders pop very loudly when she wakes up and she moans in pain.    Now, she is also complaining of pain in her fingers, ankles and knees. They pop loudly and wake her up from her sleep, crying at times.She is very flexible and has very soft skin (one of the concerns the pulmonary dr had at age one) and I am now worried that she may have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or something like that.I don't know what type of doctor I need to take her to. When I mentioned the concern to my pediatrician, he said he wasn't worried about it....but I am.Does anyone have any information that can help?Thank you very much for your help!"
