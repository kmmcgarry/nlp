"Hey, just a question. I am 19 years old, I am a competitive figure skater and i'm in good physical shape. Though nothing In my life has changed, recently I have found myself to be completely fatigued and wanting to sleep all the time. About two weeks ago I felt really light headed and hot, so I decided I check my blood pressure. I was expecting it to be too low and i found It was super high around 180/90. so I have been checking lately and though the second number seems to be more normal /80 the first is consistently over 160. I dont know where this is coming from. I dont feel over stressed or anything. I really dont know what this means..my dad has high bp but not this bad!.I don't want to alarm anyone until I figure out that this is something to be concerned about. -A little worried."
