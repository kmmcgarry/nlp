"My adopted 7 yr old son is very large for his age.    He weighs 110 lbs and is approx 56\" tall.    Almost a foot taller than peers.    He has had extreme bowel problems and fecal incontinence for years.    The Dr's say it is just constipation and prescribe Miralax which we have been on and off for years.    With the Miralax the fecal accidents can go up to 10 times a day.    He is very food restrictive and eats no more than 10 bland foods.    He has been tested for gluten allergies and it is negative.    The other thing is he is very pale and often anemic with little energy.    I do not ever see him sweat even when it is hot and he is excercising.    Any ideas would be appreciated, we are so frustrated and tired.    Thank you."
