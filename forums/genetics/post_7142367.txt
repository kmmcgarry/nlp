"Hello,I am 5 weeks pregnant & found out today that i am RH - & should have been given a Rhogam shot after a miscarraige(miscarriage)i had 6 mths ago @ 7 weeks.    What are the chances that i have become sensitized?    I am v. scared now as i felt good with this pregnancy & feels really let down that i wasn't informed of this sooner. My husband it RH +.Has anyone any info on this or experience?anything greatly appreciated."
