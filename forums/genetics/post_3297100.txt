"I also had these 2 markers on my Level II ultrasound. I worried incessantly about the possibility of Down syndrome or some other chromsomal abnormality and did not enjoy a minute of the rest of the pregnancy. Well, my adorable, healthy baby daughter Maren Brianna was born on July 18 without Down syndrome or any other issues. So, my advice is to stay positive, especially if the odds of it being a chromsomal abnormality are much lower than the odds of losing the baby in an amniocentesis. That was the case with me. I think it was 1:1200 chance of Down syndrome or another abnormality and 1:300 losing the baby if I decided to have an amnio.This discussion is related toEchogenic Foci and Choroid Plexus Cyst."
