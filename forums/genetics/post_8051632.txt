"I have a hard time understanding what is recessive and dominant epistasis.My teacher`s power points says this:for dominant epistasisDominant allele of one gene has epistatic effect.Dominant alleles of both genes allow the same precursor processing in the same direction, but into different final products.Epistatic effect will have dominant allele of that of both genes, which can lead by biosynthetic processes to more expressive form of a trait, and by this way will cover an effect of dominant allele of the hypostatic gene.for recessive;Recessive allele of one genein homozygous state has epistatic effect.Dominant alleles of both interactive genes participate in multistage synthesis of the same final product.Still dominant allele of the epistatic gene functions in one of initial phases of biosynthesis, while dominant allele of the hypostatic gene functions not until in one of its later phases.Can somebody help me plz"
