"My baby was born with esophageal atresia (the passage of the esophagus to stomach is not connected)    and died after one month of intensive medical follow up. Is it hereditary, because my wife√¢ Ä ôs sister had also similar problem. Is there any preventative measure needed for our next pregnancy. Please advise us"
