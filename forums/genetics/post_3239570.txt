"When I was pregnant with my son I would hear him cracking his joints (sounded like cracking nuckles). After his birth his umbilical cord had a missing artery. He would crack his ankle joints alot as a baby. He is 18 now and has very stretchy skin; can pop every joint he has - even his neck and back and ribs; he registers over 30 on his eye pressure; and has very fair skin.I was wondering if all these things can be Ehlers-Danlos and if the umbilical cord artery may have torn away during pregnancy because of it (weak conection or something)."
