"Hi AllI have been diagnosed with Balance reciprical transolcation of 12;17, which has been known to result in miscarriages -for which I have had 4 of in the past 18 months.I really want to be able to have my own children, and would love to be able to give my husband a child.What are my current options for increasing my fertility chances - as it feel I have exhausted my body each time I MC.My periods are currently 46 - 47 days in cycle, and it is sometimes very difficult to know exactly when I am ovulating.I feel now that it is just going to be down to fate if I concieve(conceive), I have heard that there is a chance at some IVF - which tests chromosomes at an early stage - but I doubt very much that they would offer me this on the NHS and we don't have a spare Ã‚ £50k to pay for it!Sorry for the rant - my GP doesn't seem to help even though she has had all the results back from the Recurrent MC clinic.Any advise?Thanks in Advance.Lozzaj83 xx"
