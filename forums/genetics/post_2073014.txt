"I am positive for the Duffy antibody.    My baby is positive for the antigen.    I am at 20 weeks and so far have had a very normal pregnancy.    I understand that the antibody will cross the placenta and attack the foreign blood cells of the baby causing anemia.    What can I do?    If I have the agressive strain, what are the chances the poor baby can survive my attack?"
