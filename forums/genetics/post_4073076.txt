"prion diseaseGelatin from cattle is a potential danger evenin kosher brands because, as far as I know, they arenot tested for prions. Most studies have shown thatgelatin products made from cattle are high-risk. Anyproduct made from ribs, bones, and other tissuescontaining nerve tissue, or located adjacent to it, is ahigh-risk product. All broths also contain high levelsof glutamate, which is a powerful excitotoxin. Findproducts that use fish gelatin or vegetable gelatin.So don't take gelatin caps."
