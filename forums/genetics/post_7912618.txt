"Hi, I am a very high-achieving person who has excelled in school, sports, and other areas. However, I have serious memory issues relating to episodic memory, or memory of events I have lived through. The memory issues can start as early as a month or so from the date of occurrence but are far worse once a couple of years go by. I used to do plays in high school and cannot remember now (at age 25) having been in them at all, except \"knowing\" that I did them and having a few photographs. Similarly, I am already forgetting things (walks, movies, etc.) I did with my boyfriend of only 8 months. This kind of memory issue is very strange because it sort of rips away good and bad memories. I had depression during college (possibly BPD) but this issue has been happening for my entire life since I was a child. If anyone has read studies on this I would be very interested to see what it may be caused by. Thank you."
