"I received news last week that my baby may have down syndrome.    I tested positive on my quad screen test.    I asked my midwife if she new the numbers but did not have them. I am scheduled for a level 2 ultrasound and amnio this week.    I am 34, was 33 at conception and was wondering how much age factors in when they determine quad screening?Thank you"
