"In a particular fish population the genetic variability is verified with 10 different microsatellites. With one particular microsatellite an overrepresentation of homozygote individuals are being detected, suspecting the presence of null alleles. How would you be able to proof the occurrence of null alleles for this particular microsatellite locus in individuals of that population?"
