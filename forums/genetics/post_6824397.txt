"Im 23 and started out researching about gynecomastia, which i have slightly, have since puberty. Anyway, i went on and found it could be low testosterone, and then found out it could be linked with klinefelters, which is pretty scary.I have gynecomastia, only a few chest hairs, cant grow a complete beard, im taller than my parents, i have an average penis, and from what i gather my testicles arent exactly big, ive got pit hair, pubic hair which stops at my belly button, leg hair, im not sure whether i have wide hips or its just cos ive got big legs, ive not got narrow shoulders, my voice has broke, and from what i gather my arm span is the same as my height, and i have long legs but dont know how they compare to proportion, i can ejaculate which to me looks like normal sperm, not massive amounts id say about a heaped tea spoon, ive never had learning difficulties always been a good achiever, im active play football, cycle and gym, im often shy with women, but can pretty much talk to anyonei have symptoms there, but i might just be paranoid, is it worth bringin this up with a doctor?"
