"When I was pregnant, I found out that I had B positive blood.    Both my parents are O positive, and so is my brother.I know my parents are my parents because I look like both of them, and I have their same genetic health problems. My mother's mother had B positive blood, and maybe it skipped to me?    What do you think?Thank you,lind28"
