"I know this may sound like a silly question but please bare with me.My Mother had cancer 2 years before I was born and passed away from it when I was 2... so she had cancer for a total of 4 years, and during the time she conceived and gave birth to me. She had Pheochromocytoma from which I hear is a really rare cancer.MAIN QUESTION: The fact that she conceived and gave birth to me while she had cancer the two previous years and two years after... does the heighten my chances of having cancer? Should I get tested by a genetic counselor?Thanks so much!"
