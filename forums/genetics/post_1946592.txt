"I have read about companies that are now offering genetic tests that can tell you if you are at risk of developing a variety of medical conditions from cardiovascular disease to cancer. I heard you send in a sample (I think its cheek cells) and they run a batch of tests. Has anyone done these tests? How does it work? Is it expensive?"
