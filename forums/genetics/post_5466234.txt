"I have seen a few websites where parents post their stories on MKS but it seams that a few of them got childrens that survived MKS... they say that their child is now 18 yrs old and so on, even a girl back home is saying that she lost her last child due to MKS and therefore got her 2 yrs old girl tested and she has it.. This is not what I have been told about MKS.    Could it be a similar thing and they got miss informed?    We got our testing done at the IWK in halifax and they seam to know what they are talking about, I dont think they would have given a false diagnostic to that girl.    Where could I find information that is easy to understand?    Is there a way you can select the 2 right genes by getting pregnant by invitro or something?"
