"we just found out that our baby will not survive as it has multiple defects that are related to trisomy 13. the dr is 90% leaning towards trisomy 13. There is another possiblilty as my placenta is also abnormal. He said trisomy 13 is inherited but I have read conflicting info saying that most of the time it is not inherited and just a fluke and was wonderng what is the correct answer (he said the second possiblity is not inherited)"
