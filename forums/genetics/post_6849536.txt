"My husband has a skin disease where he has abnormal layers of skin on his legs. His sklin layers are too thin and his legs are all scarred up because of numerous gashes and stitches as a child and onward. He was diagnosed with this skin disorder as a child but can't remember the name and his mother only knew but she is deceased. He said it was a very long name that also was called \"leathery skin\" ,which doesn't make sense because leather is thick.Anyway, it seems to be inherited because he said an older relative of his had the same thing on his arms years ago. My concern is that my daughter seems to have the same symptoms. If she falls and scrapes any of her legs, it usually becomes an ER visit to get stitches. When we tell the doctors at the hospital and her pediatrican about this inherited disease, they don't have answers. They want to know what the name of the disease was and my husband can't remember. Does anyone know of a similar case or even have a name for this?"
