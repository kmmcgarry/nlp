"I have recently been diagnosed homozygous for the MTHFR mutation A1298C. I have been reading up on it and have seen some red flags in my family medical history. I know that my misscarrages can be attributed to this, but my grandmother's Schitsophrenia, my aunt's Leukemia, my mother's stroke.....could this all be related?"
