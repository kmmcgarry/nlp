"My mother died of primary mucosal melanoma of the sphenoid sinus last year. Although she had had hundreds of basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck removed during her lifetime, she had no prior history of melanoma. I also have a history, much more mild than she, of basal cell carcinoma incidence. And I have another relative, my mother's brother, who also had over a hundred basal cell CAs during his lifetime and had radically mutating surgery as a result, just as my mother did.    Both lost noses, eyelids, and the external apparatus of their ears.    I am very anxious about the possibility that I may carry a genetic mutation that would predispose me to the same fate, and potentially early death, as my mother suffered. Could genetic testing help identify any genetic predisposition to mucosal melanoma, and, if so, is there anything that could be done prophylactically as a result?    In other words, is there a test?    And would it be worth it?     Thanks very much."
