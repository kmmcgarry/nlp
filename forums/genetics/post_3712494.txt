"Please help me understand....I had a urine test FISH.    It came back showing 12 abnormal cells in Chromosone 17.    What does this mean?    Will I develope a cancer in a particular area?    Should I be screening a particular area?    The doctor who prescribed the test told me not to worry about it.    But I am worried.Thank you in advance....Linda"
