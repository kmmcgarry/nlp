"Greetings Doctor,I am a 28 yr old happily married girl with PCOS. I am very well read on the syndrome and was surprised by a finding that my doctor informed me of.    Never have I heard of MS being connected to PCOS but he had stated that in some cases women with PCOS, who eventually conceive and give birth, have an elevated chance of having a child with MS. Is there truth to this? I have searched all over the web and cannot find any concrete evidence.Since this was brought to my attention I have another concern regarding PCOS and MS. My mother was diagnosed with MS over 20 years ago and exhibited minimal signs of having the disease. In the past 15 years she has had no symptoms as well, without taking any medication. Do you think this connection I have with MS would have anything to do with my PCOS?Truly,KB"
