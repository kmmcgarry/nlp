"hi, im 25 and im 2 weeks pregnant. i used isotretinoin for acne for many months last year, then quit and used again for 2 weeks last year in october. havent used them since oct, that is 6 months. plus i used diclifenac for headaches occasionally, like twicw or thrice a month, or sometimes even 4 or 5 times a month. in the past 2 weeks too, i think i used diclofenac once or twice. im really worried as i know both are contraindicated in pregnancy. im also a doctor student so i know all the hazards well. please advice me what would be best!"
