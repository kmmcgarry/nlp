"I homozygous MTHFR c677t and heterozygous PAI-1. Pre-term delivery at 27 weeks with severe IUGR. Baby passed away at 3 days. Hematologist not concerned about treatment while I'm not pregnant. I AM. What meds do you suggest. Was taking folic acid,b6,b12,asa. But what doesn't make sense to me is if we can't breakdown folic acid or b vitamins why do we take them in that form?"
