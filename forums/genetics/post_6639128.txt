"I was born with Clubfoot and had it corrected when I was a child.    I never knew growing up, and wasn't told till I was in my late teens, but I have always had trouble walking flat on my foot- I have to walk on my tip-toes when not in shoes, and I have had pains in my legs all my life.    I was wondering whether it is possible to have lasting disabilities from clubfoot?This discussion is related toHelp?."
