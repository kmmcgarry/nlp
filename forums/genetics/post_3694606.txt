"I recently had a 20 week level 2 ultrasound in which the dr had concern about the abscence of a nasal bone.    I did have the nueclo- transluency test at 12 weeks in which no markers were indicated and my statistics were 1 in 10,000.When the technician first did all the measurements, she said everything looked great.    The Dr., however, questioned her marking of a nasal bone and said it was skin.    I am caucasian, 35, and have a healthy 2 year old boy.    My husband's sister has an 11 year girl with downs.    She also has 2 other    younger children without downs.    No other comments were made about limb length, heart issues, etc.    Can this be the only marker?"
