"My son was born with sever hypospadias, he received his 3rd testosterone injection about 3 weeks ago. My son, according to the Doctor is not showing any growth. He has had genetics testing to check see if he has Androgen insensitivity syndrome or partial Androgen insensitivity syndrome(AIS) . I've read mountains of information on AIS and am looking for some personal testimonials from anyone who has AIS. I want to understand it and know what to expect. Our son is a beautiful little boy and is developing    normal in all other areas. I'm prepared for what ever path he takes us down. Your information and stories are greatly appreciated.    :)"
