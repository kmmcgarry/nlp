"Hi all my daughter had to see a developmental specialist on april 21 long story short he thinks she might have williams syndrome due to her few words talking or not communicating her needs well, and just starting to walk decently now, and since 12 months she has gained 2 lbs. She is 18 months now and those who are familar with this know how friendly this ws kids are and she is pretty friendly (smiling and not scared by strangers) but she always had people come up to her in the stores and talk to her mainly elderly in grocery stores. He also said her eye patten goes with ws i will post pic of her at 12 months (she messy was helping making halloween cookies) we have to wait 2 weeks for the results and i been doing so much research. the \"elfin\" qualities that ws has are hard for me some times i see them in her some times notif anyone has ws children comments would be great"
