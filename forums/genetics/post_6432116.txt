"After doing some research I've have come to believe that I have klinefelter's syndrome.    I originally saw a doctor because I thought I had Marfans syndrome, but upon further investigation, my self diagnosis has changed.    I exhibit many characteristics of Klienfelter's Syndrome i.e. tall, extremely long arms and legs, big hands, big hips, Gynecomastia, mild sexual dysfunction, no chest hair/limited facial hair, high voice.However I have a very tall and lanky family and my dad didn't really develop chest/facial hair till later in his 20's. I also have quite larger testicles and penis, definitely not underdeveloped. I went to a GP and and endocronologist about 1 1/2 year ago and they took my blood and everything, but gave me no definitive answers. Is it possible for me to have had an extra X chromosone, but not show up on the blood tests?    Would the endochronologist be able to make a Klinefelter's diagnosis?Does it sound like I have Klinefelters? Any advice (other then go to a doctor) I know I should go to a doctor, and I will.    Thanks!"
