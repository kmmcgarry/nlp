"A family member, male-18yrs, became numb and unable to walk after lifting an item that weighed approx 25 lbs. He went to the hospital, endured several mri and spinal taps. Two endoscope exams. He improved while in the hospital but was transferred to a rehab hospital. He has left there but is continuing out-patient rehab and twice weekly blood testing.He was diagnosed with Prothormbin Gene Mutation/Hetero. He has been placed on cumidin (sp?). His mother has been tested and diagnosed with the same gene, his father was negative.His mom saw a Hematologist yesterday and they gave her the report from the lab to keep with her. The lab report states that she has the gene and it is the hetero not homo form but the \"hetero\" is indicated with an \"A\" and then it says NEGATIVE along the same line. What does the negative mean?"
