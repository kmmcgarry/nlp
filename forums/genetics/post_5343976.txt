"My wife is pregnant with twins. She is now 19 weeks when she was 17 weeks against the doctors advice we did the quad screen test. We got a call to come in a few weeks later and they told us that the results were abnormal. It said that there is a 1:99 chance that one of the babies will have down syndrome everything else was clear. Our first ultrasound revealed nothing out of the ordinary. We immediately had a level 2 ultrasound and there were no \"soft markers\" and the due date was changed as a result of the ultrasound. I think the \"MOM\" score was high. We recently had a still born baby boy who had a diaphragmatic hernia. My wife is 27 and so am I. I read that the test is unreliable and especially with twins. I am looking for thoughts, experiences and opinions.Thank you"
