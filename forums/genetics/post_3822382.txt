"Hello,    My wife is 34 years old in her 21th week of pregnancy and she had an ultrasound this morning in which our baby was found to have EIF and SUA. We are pretty concern because even though there is not 100% certainty and medical evidence that this two markers means Down Syndrome,    these markers theirselvels are related to it.    Can anyone please share with us your experience and what did the doctors find after the amnio or any other exam.    Thank you very much."
