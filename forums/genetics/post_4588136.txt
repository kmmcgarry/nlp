"Anyone that has experience with any of this, and would like to discuss it, I'd be interested in talking about it.    I have 5 family members affected with FAP, 2 died of colon cancer at the age of 32 & 38.    My son at 31 to a Desmoid, and a grandson to a Desmoid at 18. My surviving son was diag. at 12, had a total colectomy and is a healthy 38 today. I have a lot of experience with all this, and sometimes sharing can help."
