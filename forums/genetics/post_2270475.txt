"My husband and I are bout 34 years old. I have 11 years old daughter from another marriage. I had 2 chemical pregnancies in 12/06 (max HCG 60) and 5/07 of (max HCG 17) and tubal pregnancy in 8/07 (max HCG    2,500) that was resolved with injection.My husband tried to get pregnant with his ex-wife for 3 years; she had one chemical pregnancy. Now she has a baby with her second husband.In July this year I had a test to check my tubes, they were in the perfect condition. Right after that I ended up with tubal pregnancy.We tried IVF this month and got 4 eggs that been fertilized by sperm naturally. 3 embryos been implanted on the 3rd day, but I have not become pregnant. Insurance company refused to cover IVF due to IVF is not recommended with RPL. I had probably 30 different blood tests, all of them been normal. My husband√¢ Ä ôs 2 Semen Analyses tests this spring had only 2% of normal spermatozoids, but the recent one in 10/07 showed 6%. IVF MD told us that he think that our problem is abnormal embryos and chromosomal problems from my not young eggs. I think is something with my husband. We ordered 2 more tests - Sperm DNA Integrity and Y chromosome microdeletion assays. I have following ??:-Can we try naturally or only go through IVF? Our infertility doctor√¢ Ä ôs opinion is that if we try naturally that I might have another tubal pregnancy. Other doctors think that we can try naturally.-Should we wait for another 2-3 month or we can try now since I have not become pregnant after IVF?"
