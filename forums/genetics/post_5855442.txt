"I am 8 weeks pregnant. Yay!     I am 37 years old, the world thinks I am 42 years old, ie medical records, ( very long story ).When having the integrated serum testing done they will adjust for age.    Because I am younger how do I adjust the results for my correct age so that results are interpreted correctly?    I have attempted to find the \"formula or math\" they use with no success."
