"Just found out I am pregnant I was prescribed Zonegran before I knew I was pregnant and I took 9 pills. I am being sent to a genetics counselor soon but I just can't wait. Can you tell me any information about what my chances are of something being wrong with my baby. I could have been anywhere from a 4-8 weeks while on it."
