"My daughter was just diagnosed with Factor V Leiden, A1298C+, and Homocysteine Cardiovascular 5.7.    She is pregnant.    The tests showed that she inherited it from ONE parent --which has to be me.I am finding it difficult to find anything significant on these.Does anyone else have these, or know how serious they are, or what a person can do about it?She has been referred to a High Risk Obstetrician.I have had a blood clot, a MIA stroke, one likely heart attack at age 28, a cancer suspician in breast just last year -- all of which seem to go with these genetic mutations.Please steer me in an informative direction!    Thanks!"
