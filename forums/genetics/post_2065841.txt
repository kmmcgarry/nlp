"I wasn't told by my mother what it was called, she had always called it \"ear tag syndrome\", and had said that it was hereditary. Now that I'm starting a family, I would like to know more about it and any possible complications that it may cause in newborns.The only problem is that I'm fairly screwed up genetically, so I don't know what things are related to this syndrome, and what may be standard inherited genetics. The main symptom, as the name may suggest was preauricular tags. I have multiple on each ear.Here is a list of descriptions, and hints, not all may be related to this.Preauricular tagsDouble jointed fingers and kneesApparently high rate of miscarriage or still born due to problems with heart and lungs (anecdotal from my mother)Migraines during youthAsthmaSevere allergies and/or sinus problemsNo mental retardation (some people have said I was the smartest person they knew, but I'm in the South, so take it with a grain of salt).Deformed teeth (my canines have grown out higher up and look like fangs, one dentist had said I had too many teeth, and the space behind them looks like a missing tooth).I think that's it, some of those may not be related to the disorder. If anyone can figure out what this \"Ear tag syndrome\" my mother was referring to could be, or even a web resource that may allow me to research it, I'd appreciate it."
