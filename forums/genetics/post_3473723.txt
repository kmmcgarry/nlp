"I was recently diagnosed with Hemochromatosis.    My ferratin level is above 1600 and I tested positive for both mutations in the DNA test.    My blood doctor now wants me to get a liver biopsy.    My question is if this is necessary.    Is it possible that the high ferratin and positive DNA test could represent anything else?    Is the biopsy worth the risk to be sure of the diagnosis?"
