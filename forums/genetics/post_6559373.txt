"Hi everyone, I am 30yr and 11 wks pregnant I had an ultrasound last week based on bleeding I have been having.    I measured 10wk and 4 days and then blasted with the devasting news, I was told my baby has a significant amount of fluid on the back of her neck (Nuchal Fold), however the doctor never measured it and when I    asked why not? I was told because I was to early in pregnancy to get an accurate measure? I was also told the baby has Omphalocele and most likely will be born with something called Andrews Syndrome and if I should carry to term my baby would not make it after birth and would die.    I was then adivised right away to terminate pregnacy .. I am schedule for a CVS this week and I am mess! My question is could I be to early in my pregnancy to have an accurate result? and could this very well all go away? What else besides abnormalities can cause an abnormal nuchal fold? HELP!"
