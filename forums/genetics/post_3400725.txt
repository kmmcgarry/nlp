"My wife had a second miscarriage on 2nd April'2008. The pregnancy was ofmore than two months. She was in complete bed rest with very littlemovement inside our home only. She noticed sticky type blood discharge onher undergarments on 1st April and later on Ultra sound test \"incompleteabortion\" was found. We were completely refraining from any kind of sex.My wife first conceived in the month of june'07. However less than 1 monthpregnancy terminated on 11 July'07. We had got Seminal Fluid Analysis,TORCH test and Chromosomal analysis (Karyotype) done for both of us.Seminal Fluid test and Karyotype were OK in case of me(Husband).TORCH testof wife were OK.However in Wife's Karyotype, inv(9)(p11:q12) wasmentioned. The test were done at Ranbaxy, Mumbai. Many doctors said thatthis is the most common variation and does not have any clinicalsignificance. However some other said that it may cause miscarriage.Kindly guide whether this is true?whether there is any cure possible, whatkind of precautions we should take during pregnancy.Please help.......... my wife is at the point of breakdown."
