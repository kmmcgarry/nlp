"My twin sister is 26 years old. Has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis since she was 20. Was recently taking a strong antibiotic classified as a \"sulfa\" drug. Had a severe allergic reaction with flu like symptoms that kept her in bed for a week. Just when it looked like she was getting better she started convulsing and lost all control of her limbs. She stayed in the hospital for 3 days and they finally said she had Dystonia brought on by her reaction. She hasn't gotten better. She still can't walk without her legs giving out on her, her hands are stiff and claw like and she has a hard time finding words. She is easily fatigued and has lost weight. My question is this...my dad has hemachromatosis (sp?) and a b12 deficiency. I've read several articles that say a B12 deficiency can sometimes be misdiagnosed with Dystonia. Is that common? She has been sick much longer than before she took the antibiotics so I wonder if there is more to it genetically and that just set her off. Please help...she is my world and I would love to see her living life again. Thank you!"
