"This is filed under hearing loss since the Waardenburg syndromes are leading causes of genetic hearing loss.    Obviously unless he' s wearing undetectable hearing aids, the actor Joaquin Phoenix isn't deaf.     However his one eye is green and the other one is blue. Pic of Joaquin Phoenix.    Plus he has a unilateral microform cleft.    Clefts can a part of the disorder.    His eyebrows are on the thick side and tend to run together.    These can be signs of the genetic disorder.OTOH I don't want to jump to conclusions since these physical traits may be caused by other conditions and not be part of any syndrome."
