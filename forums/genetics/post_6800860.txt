"I have Marfans and no means of going to a doctor. Right now i have a pinched nerve in my lower back. I went to the ER when it was hurting a lot and they referred me,sent me a check that i can't pay and sent me home.. Anyways.. i am home now trying to deal until we get means for a doctor... So my question.. sorry.. I am getting the feeling my heart is beating faster or irregular.. It is hard to explain but it makes ya feel ... ''irritated'' i deal with it by trying breathing calmly and steadying myself. Should i be really worried?"
