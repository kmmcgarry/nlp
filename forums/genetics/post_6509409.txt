"I think I might have vitiligo?Im sixteen and got badly sunburnt and have been applying aloe vera constantly for 3 days.But I have small patches of white skin on my stoimach, and although it isn't as bad as some of the pictures of vitiligo that I have googled, it still seems as though I have it.I have three questions1: How do I know for sure that I have it?2: will It spread?3: How can I get rid of it?"
