"My mother is 64 years old.    Her mother was Rh negative.    My aunt, the fir born had no problems during birht. My mother, the second born did, but continued to live. She was born in the 1940's, prior to any treatment such as Rhogam was available.She has always had heart murmur problems & anemia.    Since 1994, she has had blood clots and 3 different pulmonary embolisms.    She has been on Coumadin therapy now for the last 14 years.    Whenever, she needs to have a surgical type of procedure, the doctors must stop the Coumadin for 5 days.    After the procedure, she develops blood clots and another pulmonary embolism arises. She has now developed kidney disease and a complex renal cyst.In your opinion, could this be connected to the Rh factor? If so, are ther any treatments at this time in her life that she can take to prevent any further complications?Thank you for any information that you can provide.Shannon"
