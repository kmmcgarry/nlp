"My oldest daughter (51) has Ehlers-Danlos. We were at a family reunion, and amazingly, three of the ladies present, had EDS. The talk progressed to whether this disease was genetic or hereditary. I am adopted and have no knowledge of my family health history.My question is this:Why are three women from my wife's (bloodline) side of the family, i.e., my daughter, a niece, and the daughter of another niece, have the same affliction. Also, what differentiates a genetic and/or a hereditary disease."
