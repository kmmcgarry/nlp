"I have been diagnosed with hereditory spherocytosis and spleenomegaly.    I have a lot of sypmtoms, including severe pain in the spleen area, severe fatigue, bloating, cramping when I eat, frequent urination.    I have been told I am not sick enough yet to have the spleen removed.    (Which I know is the only treatment, my daughter, mother and multiple family members have all had their spleens removed.)    My most recent blood test showed normal, but on the lower side of my hemoglobin count, but showed a severly low heptaglobin count of only 2!    My research shows the this indicates severe hemolytic anemia.    Can someone please tell me if the count being this low is dangerous or what I need to watch for.    I do not want my liver damaged because they don't want to take my spleen out to early.    I had my gall bladder removed several years ago, even though I was showing signs of speherocytosis at the time, I could not get anyone to listen to me and have it checked.    I know my bilirubin count is also high.    If anyone has any information to help me, I would appreciate it."
