"34 yrs. old; already high risk due to previous alcohol and drug related problems - of which are not a problem now - always one day at a time.    This is 3rd preg. with two elementary age children.    Second marriage.    Within last year has had hospital confinement relating to pancreas, pulmonary embollism, pneumonia.    Not in the best of health. Is considered high risk.    Having to take lovenox injections. Just found out        Now considered higher risk. Told Lovenox will not be enough for blood clot problems.     question is:    MTHFR mutations, C677T and A1298C information found give pretty much the same explanation; forums understandably give the best outcomes and successes.    But, would like to know the other side of the coin as well.    Birth defects, what kind, has anyone out here had negative outcomes with these pregnancies?"
