"I had a chromosone study on my blood done recently and was told that there more than 80% of the myeloid cells have only 1 X chromosone.    Coincidentally, I also have neurological issues.    I have been diagnosed with MS, but some of the symptoms appear to be overlapping with another yet undiagnosed neurological disorder.Is there anyone on this forum who understands and/or who can explain in simple language if having this chromosone scenario is related to anything clinically significant?    I can not wrap my brain around this test result at all.Thanks and I hope everyone is having a wonderful Friday.Julie"
