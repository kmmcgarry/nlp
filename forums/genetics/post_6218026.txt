"My son will be 2 in December....he seemed to be a healthly happy baby and for the most part he still is. He started to talk around 10 months old but when he started to walk around 13 months he pretty much just stopped talking. The doctor's in Illinois where we are from didn't seemed to concerned about it. However we just recently moved to Kentucky and they seem very worried about it. My son has a speech therapist and an occupational therapist. They say he has some sensory issues and they want him to be evaluated for Autism. He has seen a ped. neurologist who just recently ran some blood test and one test came back that said he has high amounts of protein in his urine and they want him to have another test done called a plasma amino acid blood test. My question is I have a RH negative blood disorder and my son does not.....I am curious if this developmental issue could have been caused due to my blood disorder? Is there something that could have happened while I was pregnant with him to cause this because during my pregnancy I had protein in my urine and had to do the 24 hour urine test cuz they were worried about preclampsia I was never diagnosed with it though."
