"EDS runs in my family, primarly the females.    I don't know what specific type at this time.    Issues I have involve hypermobility, hip dysplasia, pelvic prolapse, poor healing, scoliosis and chronic pain etc.    My mother and grandmother both have EDS as well, and also have spinal stenosis.    Is this possibly related to the EDS as well? We are only just finding out now that many of our families health issues are related to the hypermobility.    We are hoping to get some genetic testing done as we just found out my granddaughter has a mother with EDS and a father with Marfan....."
