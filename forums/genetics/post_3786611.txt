"HI.I am 22 weeks pregnant with a baby girl. I had Amnio test, everything was Normal, except that Fragile x repeat was 55.Five years ago I had the test during my pregnancy with my son, my repearts was 55, my son got the perfect x.My repeats never changed since then, still 55.I am so worried if the baby girl will have any problems. I know I have 55 repeats like her, I don't have any problems, I am just sooooo worried.Any idea please?"
