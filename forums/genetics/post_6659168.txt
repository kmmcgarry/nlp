"Recently there has been a tremendous increase in the number of questions posed about duplications and deletions found on chromosomal micro-array (CMA), and I post this in hopes that it will help alleviate some of the frustration so many people encounter when given information about abnormalities seen on this kind of chromosome testing.First of all, it's important to understand:    CMA analysis is pretty new science.    The ability to test for micro-deletions and duplications can be considered as still in its infancy, just recently borne out of the past decade.    Therefore, very little information is currently available about what they are finding on these tests.    It's important to remember that Genetic testing, in comparison to other sciences and medicines, is a fairly new method of approaching health care, and what can be identified in a scientific laboratory setting does not necessarily translate into medical understanding.The human genome with all its complexity has the potential for an infinite possibility of variations: duplications and deletions can now be detected and reported, but with no historical basis for comparison, interpreting the existence of these chromosomal variations remains a challenge.    Oftentimes abnormal results don't lead to any answers at all simply due to the fact that many of these results are new findings.    Not necessarily that the condition never existed before, simply that it was never documented -- the technology simply did not exist. Think of CMA testing where it is today as akin to the finding of the Rosetta stone:    we can see the stone and identify the markings, but we are unable to understand what it means due to a lack of reference.It is surely frustrating to be do test after test that yields no helpful answers, only more questions.    The only encouragement that I can offer those who are struggling with these concerns is that as genetic understanding continues to advance, identifying and collecting the information gained by such testing is the path by which science can arrive at answers in the future. The information may be an enigma today, but it may lead to understanding and answers for those affected now and in the future.Best wishes to all."
