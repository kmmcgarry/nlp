"We found out our son had Full Trisomy 13 when he was a little over a week old. We are wondering what are the chances of having a unhealthy baby with any disorder, syndrome or retardation after having to deal with the loss of our precious angel. Were scared to concieve(conceive)and go through something else that is so life changing and we didnt get very many answers from our genetisis during our sons 2 week stay in the hospital. He did tell us we have a 1 in 1,000 chance of having another trisomy 13 baby. Does that make us more at risk to have a baby with problems in any other way? Its very hard to loose a child and we are scared to try and loose another or have a very unhealthy baby. We would rather adopt and help another child have a family than bring another child into the world with problems."
