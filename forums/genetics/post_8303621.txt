"Hello my son was born missing his muscle on the right side of his shoulder.We just recently discovered this. ( he is now 5 months old. He seems to be having trouble holding himself up when on his belly. We don't have much information and are awaiting genetic testing because he also has \" rocker bottom feet\"    not a severe case butwe have already been to a neurological doctor and are in physical therapy. ANY info would be helpful. He seems to also favor his right side. The physical therapy is to stretch his neck muscles and leg muscles on the left side. The neurological doctor has said it is not cerebral palsy and sent us for genetic tests. Has anyone else dealt with or has any similar experiences. I am worried and can find no information. Thank you in advance. -Melissa"
