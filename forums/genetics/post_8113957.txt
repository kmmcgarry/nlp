"About 4 years ago i noticed the toe next to my pinky toe on my left foot is smaller than the same toe on my right foot. It just stopped growing i guess. Well it..is very painful and uncomfortable! This toe doesnt touch the ground and on the outter    side of my foot a bit below my pinky toe my bone seems to curve out. I am tired of the pain. My question.is if there is anything i can do(surgically perhaps) to fix it?? Make it normal sized??"
