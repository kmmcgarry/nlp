"I'm worried. I have 3 daughters and one of the daughters had neonataladrenoleukodystrophy and passed away, although it could never be confirmed. She had numerous lab tests and they even examined her brain after she passed.The other 2 daughters are normal. What are the chances that the healthy daughters could pass the gene on to their children?"
