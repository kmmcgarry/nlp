"Hello, I just got a call from my pediatrician stating that my 2 week old baby has alpha thalassemia minor, as indicated by her new born screen. I am confused as to how this is passed on. She is my fourth child and the only one who has been diagnosed with this.Do my husband and I both need to be carriers for her to have this? I am questioning as to whether I could have this myself as I have always been anemic and also have smaller than normal RBC's. If I have this is that enough to have had it passed on to her, or does my husband necessarily have to be a carrier also?Also what does this mean for her when she grows up and decides to have children of her own? Will she be at risk for passing on a more severe form of thalassemia to her children?I have my RN, BSN from Linfield and have been a registered nurse for 6 years now, so I have somewhat of an understanding of the situation, but the genetics are very confusing!Thank you so much for your time, I look forward to your response!"
