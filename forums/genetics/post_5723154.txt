"I have a Robertsonian Translocation and after 2 years of unsuccessful IVF PGD    I began to research why it wasnt working. My research showed that for some inexplicable reason RT carriers do not respond well to HCG used as part of IVF and I was told to try naturally which we did and finally we have a healthy daughter. I am now 39 and want another child only now my husbands sperm has been tested and is pretty useless on all fronts. Low sperm cound, low motility and abnormal in shape. After a year of trying naturally I dont think his sperm is capable of much. So I figured IUI was as close as we could get to trying naturally. I am tempted to do a stimulated IUI so I have more eggsin the mix but am concerned that the HCG I would take will affect the quality of my eggs. Can HCG affect egg quality? Should I just be naturally ovulating, producing 1 egg and doing IUI instead of stimulating?"
