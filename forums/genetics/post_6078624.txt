"I was diagnosed positive for one copy of the A1298C Mutation after mulitple miscarriages.    I am 39 years old.    My first pregnacy went without any complications in 2000 and I have a healthy 9 year old.    What does this mean for future pregnancies and what are my risks while pregnant?    Are the risks for life after pregnancy and beyond? My husband and I are trying for one more.    The doctor told me to go ahead and take baby aspirin and b complex.    She also said if I become pregnant they would start me on shots at around 10-12 weeks post conception."
