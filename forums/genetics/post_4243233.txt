"Hello,My question is about the inheritance of recessive genes. If my grandmother's brother has a daughter who is an albino, could I be a carrier of albinism?I know there is a 25% chance of albinism to occur when two carriers have a child together, but I was wondering how much a family history of this condition can be important when it's not a very close relative.Thank you.F."
