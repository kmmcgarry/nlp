"Does anyone know know the NAME of this antenna-like thing hanging on my ears?? It's an excess skin. I don't think it's a skin tag.. I got this since birth. If you're in the phil, \"kuntil\" is the filipino term for this. I have no photo of it yet. but in case someone out there already know what this is, comment on this please. and oh, would it cost much more expensive than removing a skin tag??? thanks people."
