"I am very worried about the Marfan Syndrome. I have had 2 doctors in the past ask if I had ever been diagnosed with the syndrome, the first was because the doctor noticed my class 3 jaw ( I am due to have surgery on this) as far as I am aware this is not a sign of Marfan's the second doctor said it because of my height and slimish build. I am 22 years old, 6 ft 2 inches.I became so paranoid about me having this that I saw a cardiologist who performed an ECG and echocardiogram. Both came back clear, he said the valves were normal and the cardic structure and function were completely normal. I do not have a deformed chest, my sternum is every so slightly indented. No one in my family has ever been diagnosed with Marfan's. My brother, cousins and uncles are all around my height.I feel as thought I am being victimised to an extent as doctors seem to be judging me on my height, which I don't think is THAT tall anyhow. I am not hypermobile, do not have flat feet or exagerated arches. I think my palate is a little high but it is not arched at all ( asked a maxillofacial surgeon)."
