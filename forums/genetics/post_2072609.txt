"My daugther (18 y/o) is expecting a baby in April 08, She had a Quad screen done when she was 16 weeks pregnant, which was about a week and a half ago. We got the results today and it was positive for Down Syndrome a ratio of 1:9. We are scheduled for a level 2 ultrasound next week, so please pray for her, We know that she is having a baby girl.. We have no history in our family of Down Syndrome the father says the same. Has anyone ever heard of the numbers being so high and everything turning out ok. thanks for any help anyone can give me"
