"Hi.    I am writing to see if anyone is familiar with a genetic disorder that involves epicanthal folds and short 4th toes. I noticed my 6 yr old's unusual eye lids when she was born.    I work in eye care so I was probably predisposed to noticing this, lol.    Her eyes watered a great deal and I could tell her lower lids were a little odd and the inner canthi didn't look quite normal.    But none of her doctors ever seemed to be concerned, including our eye doctor, and I never brought it up.The other day she asked me to paint her finger and toe nails and for the first time I noticed the 4th toe of each foot is noticably short.    Her toe nails also seem a little clubbed on each toe, but the 4th toes especially.We've dealt with some developmental issues that had to do with over-sensitivities to clothing tags and sock seams, as well as an intolerance for being bounced around, etc.    The ped even looked into her having something called sensory integration dysfunction.    It was investigated, but discarded as a diagnosis eventually.    It was also suspected she had some visual problems since she turns her head to focus on things closely, etc.    But aside from a fairly mild glasses prescription, the eye doc thought she was ok and would outgrow this head tilt habit.She is in the second half of her k'garten year and we have dealt with a few learning issues, but nothing really severe so far.I have read everything I can find on disorders that might result in both epicanthal folds and short 4th toes, but so far the only ones I can find report severe mental retardation and other physical traits she does not display.Does anyone know if there is a disorder that has these two specific traits?    Or can the others I have read about present in very mild forms where the intellectual development issues are less obvious?TIA"
