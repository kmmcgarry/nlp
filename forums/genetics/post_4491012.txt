"I am a 21 year old female who was diagnosed with FAP when I was 11 or 12 years old.    I had a colonoscopy done because my mother died of colon cancer.    When they performed the test, they found I had quite a few pre-cancerous and cancerous cells.    About one year after these tests were performed, my doctor decided that I should have a surgery to remove the cells.    Instead, they had to remove my whole large intestine...I had a colostomy for 2 months...I was 13 years old.    I had tests performed on my esophagous and stomach.    They found polyps in both but never did surgery.    I had bad heartburn before my surgeries and after my surgeries it was gone.    I have not been able to have these tests performed in 5 years to due insurance.    I am also starting to show other signs that I am worried about.    Such as, the inability to eat a full meal, feeling like I am full after a few bites...and I am drained all the time.    Could these be signs of cancer?...or is it just the polyps aggravating me because they are either increasing in size, or multiplying?    I really need help with this because I am really scared that I may be sick.    Please help if you can."
