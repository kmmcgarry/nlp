"Today I'm 24weeks and I went in for a follow up ultra sound on my baby's head. My doctor said she's growing just fine she's in the 50%tile but her head is measuring inbetween 2% and 3%. Her brain looks healthy and everything else. Its just the size of her head. Doctor suggested getting the amincentesis to see what's all wrong and if I want to terminate the pregnancy they can. Which I won't unless it's life threatening to her or me. I'm just not sure if I should do it. I have to decide in the next 14hours if I want it done. I'm not sure what to do. Also my head, my aunts and grandma's were all small when we were born. Could it just be she has a small head since everything else is fine or could it be more?"
