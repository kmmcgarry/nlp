"*** My Ferritin levels are 2481 and my % Iron SAT is 93%. am I in immediate danger?*** I've been sick and tired for 20 years, my lymph system is swollen and retain lot's of water in my legs and abdomen, my ears shudder and ring, my nose bleeds and I have a terrible headache! My liver burns and hurts! I am covered with red dots all over my body. My Dr. finally gave in and got the liver panel blood work I demanded ordered this week and the results floored him!    He now believes me, and he was convinced I was suffering from depression ...NOT!    My blood smells like pure heavy metal.     My levels are so high ... I am waiting to see a specialist; I have no idea if I can wait that long with these levels!        My kids are all being tested this week ... my son suffers from Epilepsy, adult onset ... grand mal seizures. I think there is a link for sure ... Thank God we found out ... I am not crazy ... my family believes me now! I have been a very sick girl but keep pushing and pushing to move forward. What do I have to look forward to as far as treatments ... anyone? Thanks ~Tamara"
