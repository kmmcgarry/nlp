"Recently, a family member of mine has died from the inherited prion disease Gerstmann√¢ Ä ìStr√É §ussler√¢ Ä ìScheinker syndrome (GSS). From what I could find out on Wikipedia, GSS is classed as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and that it may be transmitted via blood transfusions.I used to donate blood but ceased doing so when I discovered that my grandfather supposedly died of CJD (now believed to be a misdiagnosed case of GSS).My question is this; if I have the disease, does that mean the people who were given my blood may now also have the disease?Any feedback is appreciated."
