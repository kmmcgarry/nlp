"Hi. I recently found from a Hemotalogist I have MTHFR A12A8C heterozygous. What does this really mean and what are treatments? I know only that I cant metabolize folic acid as I should. I also have Portal vein Thrombosis, as result of having my spleen removed..or possible cause of spleen being enlarged. But I had so many test over a year and half before surgery I find it hard to beleive it was mised pre surgery. I am on Lovenox for the PVT. So tell me more about me please.I am only 27...this is all alot to swallow."
