"I have a four year old girl with autism and my last pregnancy I had a girl with Turners.    Unfortunately, I had decided to terminate the pregnancy, (something I am still dealing with today) due to many health reasons.    My question is I am 28 and very much so want to have another baby, but am concerned with the risk of having another child with a disability.    I am interested in knowing what my risk is.Also, is there a connection between autism and Turners?"
