"my daughter is 2yrs old and has had problems from the day she was born she has had suvier constipation, teathered cord, she bruses easly, is very flexibal, and is delayed in leaning but catching up quickly she has been going to a GI doc from the time she has been 3 months old, and has been threw 2 sugerys to correct her teathered cord she also sees a neurologist. The GI doc has not been able to find anything on why she has problems going to the bathroom and has been on many different meds to help her go she has been threw meny tests for diff deseases and everything comes back negative. As far as i know the surgury for her TCS helped with that( it was only done in Feb) and the neurologist has not found anything wrong which is a good thing. she has 2 half siblings from her fathers side that have been diagnosed with EDS could this be her problem? should i have her tested for this too? the poor child has been threw so much with no answers to anything."
