"I had my first ultra sound at 20 weeks, and the doctors called me and told me the head is abnormally small and misshapen. I am already a high risk pregnancy, and because of the ultrasound results, I am being sent to a perinatologist and a genetic counseler for some more tests. The fetus's body measures at 20 weeks,and the head at 16. What can/should I expect from this visit?"
