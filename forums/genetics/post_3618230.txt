"Hi, I'm really worried - I had my u/s last night and I can't help but think that my baby doesn't look right- can anyone give me their opinions?    for a start, without being too descriptive, is that my baby's 'peewee' b/c if it is it looks awfully long - I'm hoping it's the umb. cord - can someone please help me to understand what I'm seeing.    The u/s dr said everything looked normal - I'm just hoping he wasn't keeping me in the dark till my OB sees the scan pictures.    Also, in all the 4D scan pictures I can see my baby's brain - is this supposed to be ok.    My baby looks like an alien but all the 18 week 3d scans on the net the babies look like babies - please, I need honest opinions.    thank you to you all."
