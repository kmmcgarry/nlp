"My joints are always hurting sometimes far worse than usual. There are many people in my family that have various forms of arthritis and a few people think that I may have it. I don't think it's that. I bruise really easily, My knees and ankles like to give out on my and hurt a lot. My fingers and wrists are always popping and hurt more than anything. I'm constantly partially dislocating my fingers, knees and hips. And my back hurts almost as bad as my hands. I'm rather flexible but I try not to do things that other people can't like stretching in certain ways.. because I figure that it's not normal and probably a bad Idea. But I can do things like touch my thumb to my wrist. I'm an 18 year old girl and I'm on my own with no health insurance, But I want to know whats wrong with me and what I can do. Can anybody help?"
