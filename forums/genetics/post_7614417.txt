"Hi I was mistakenly diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome and had 5 cycles of chemo.    That was in 2010I just had chromosome studies done (blood) and I have been found to have del 15q 11.2 which means I have Prader Willi syndrome.    Problem is I'm 55, 5'5\", overweight but not obese and test high average intelligence, I do not have behavioral issues.I suppose this leaves me with some questionsCan you have asymptomatic Prader Willi?Is this deletion associated with any other syndromes (I have Cu deficiency bone marrow failure)BMB taken a year ago showed no chromosome abnormalities so could the chemo have damaged my chromosomes and caused this deletionThat's all I can think of at the moment but my brain is trying to absorb this fresh bit of news, so I'm sure I'll think of more questions later.Regards"
