"My LMP was July 31st. I have normal 28 day cycles. Maybe a couple of times a year, 29-30 day cycles. Rarely does this occur. My period lasts from 3-4 days. Now, my question is.... I found out I was pregnant after my first missed MP didn't show on August 28th. I know I got pregnant on either August 9th (boyfriend) or August 11th (ex-boyfriend). Those are the only two dates I had sex. And, of course, I know I have to have a paternity test to be 100% sure. But, just for the sake of medical bills as of right now, which day is the most likely that I conceived?Additional DetailsJuly 31st was the FIRST day of my last period. I agree. I'm thinking more towards the ex since I should have ovulated around the 15th. My boyfriends' sperm should have been dead by then. Thanks to all for your opinions. And, I didn't CHEAT on my bf. We had broken up. We JUST recently reconciled AFTER he found out I was expecting. And, yes he does know it's a possibility it might not be his, As a matter of fact, I told him I'm 75/25 it's NOT. He's fine with that. People make mistakes. I slept with my ex unprotected. I know now the error of my ways."
