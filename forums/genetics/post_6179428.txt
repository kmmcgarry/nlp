"So... There is NO doult in my mind that my bf is my child's father... But he sometimes makes comments to make me second guess... here is the story:My bf and I were broken up. I went out of town and saw an ex- we had sex on Jan 13th, used a condom.    I had a NORMAL/REGULAR period Jan 16th.    Came back home, got back with my bf and had unprotected sex multiple times...    Had positive pregnancy test Feb. 9th.    According to my doctor I am due Oct 23rd by last period dates and Oct 21st by ultrasound.... and that conception date was Jan 28th.PLEASE tell me I am not wrong in believing that the baby is my bf's and NOT my exs.... The dates and math don't add up, so I am confident that it isn't my exs.What do you guys think???"
