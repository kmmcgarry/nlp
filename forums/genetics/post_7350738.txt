"On march 25th I had sex with this guy I was dating,I then had my period on march 28th.but then some time at the beginning of april I had sex with my ex.I then found out I was prego so I went to see my obgyn and I told him about my situation,he then stated judging by my lmp and my sonos that my unborn is from my ex.because my due date is january 2nd 2012 and when I did the conseption caluator for the guy i was dating (being that I know the exact day of conseption) it stated my due date wouldve had to had been dec.16 .but my due date is jan.2nd so with the other pregnancy calculater. That goes by your due date stated the time of conseption that went with my actual due date would have been anywhere between april 4th and 15th.and I was only with my ex in april.so am I in the clear in knowing who the father of my unborn is?and if not,what is the percentage chance that my ex is not the father.please no judgement."
