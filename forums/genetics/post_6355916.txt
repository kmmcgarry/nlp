"I have a son with 46,XY,der(15)t(2;15)(p23.2;q26.2) i was told by Arkansas Childrens Hospital, that he is the onlyt child with his chromosone disorder, but yet they only want to see him once a year. Shouldnt doctors be studying him more if he is the only person in the world with these chromosones???"
