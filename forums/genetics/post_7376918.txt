"So I received a call from my doctor with my results for the 2nd part of my screening tests; I'm now 18 wks. He said my trisomy levels were normal, so no down's but the results for neural tube defects was borderline. I am a complete mess, so worried about this baby. Have to repeat test on Monday, but having to wait is agony. Trying to keep it together so our 9yr old doesn't suspect anything but it's so hard. Anyone else have something similar happen to them?"
