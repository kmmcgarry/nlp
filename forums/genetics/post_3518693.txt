"I was recently diagnosed with M.E.N. II. I have tumors on my left adrenal gland and pancreas also a thyroid goiter and suspected pituitary gland disorder. My hormone levels are normal and the tumors for now are seem to be benign. Now I am experience severe abdominal pain just below my lower right rib, sever dizziness and blurred vision. My GP thinks the abdominal pain is due to a gallbladder dysfunction and am scheduled to have a HIDA scan next week. My question is, could the abdominal pain be caused by the MEN?"
