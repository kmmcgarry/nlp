"I am 7 weeks pregnant and i messed up after my husband and i got into a fight and cheated.    I slept with guy A on march 10 and then my husband march 12. Can anyone help me with this. I know you cant really do anything until the child is born but if i still feel like it belongs to guy A.... i am going to have an abortion. i have checked those conception date calculators and its kinds of a toss up..... my LMP was April 2. Any suggestions???"
