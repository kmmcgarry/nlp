"I have two children a boy and a girl. My little girl was born with cataracts(congenital).    I do not have cataracts and neither does her father(there is NO history in his family).    The only history I have of congenital cataracts is that my grandfather on my fathers side(would be her great grandfather) had congenital cataracts.    I also have 3 first cousins (would be her second cousins) who were born with cataracts.    My grandfather had ten children-none of them were born with cataracts and only three offspring from the ten were born with cataracts.    My father had four children -none of them were born with cataracts.    However--- my father must have been a carrier and passed the carrier status on to me.    I have been reading much about dominant recesssive genes etc etc.    I'm not getting the understanding I would like.    My little girls doctor thinks the condition to be hereditary.    I am very much confused at what my offsprings odds are of being born with cataracts.    It seems so sporadic but it has to be hereditary. Please help It seems there is no pattern."
