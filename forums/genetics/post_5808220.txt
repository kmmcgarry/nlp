"Hi, I was recently advised that my 4 year old daughter has an unbalanced chromosomal translocation (long arm y/short arm x). This was discovered after investigations into her global developmental delay. She also has lymphangioma in her eye socket which at this stage is assumed to be unrelated, but who knows. I'm unable to contact the paediatrician at the moment but I have some questions I'd like answered if possible. First of all, I'm a little confused as to why a 'y' chromosome is affected - don't girls only have 'x' chromosomes?? Also, is this likely to affect her menstrual cycle and/or the likeyhood of becoming pregnant when she's older? Soooo confused!! :("
