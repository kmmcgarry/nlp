"My son was born with very high lactic acid levels, in lactic acidosis, and had other unusual presentations; upper body tremors, bilat hand clawing, bilat fisting while asleep. The lactic levels seemingly went dormant although he was developmentally delayed; I would like to know if my son could still have a miti disorder that was not diagnosed because we did not perform a muscle biopsy back then. Thank you."
