"Hi. My mom says that My son goes thru shoes and clothes so quickly, he is 5 yrs old, because i did when i was his age,and she doesnt mean this statement as he is just growing quickly, but she says it is hereditary...i am wondering if this is true. She home schooled me so i get most of my information from her."
