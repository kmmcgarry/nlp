"I just received results for an avuncular DNA test that a young lady & I.    I may be her aunt (my brother's daughter).    My brother does not wish to provide a blood sample, so she & I did.     The company that we used stated that the probability of the 2 of us being related is 24.24%.    She & I share one or two alleles for:    TH01 (6), D18S51 (16), Penta E (13), D13S317 (8), D7S820 (8), CSF1PO (11), Penta D (12), vWA (16), TPOX (8 AND 11).    Now, call me an optimist, but I would think that 24.24% is pretty high & the liklihood of two unrelated people sharing these alleles pretty low.    However, I don't know a thing about genetics & I have no clue as to how common these particular alleles may be.    What are your thoughts?    I asked her mother last nite if she'd be willing to provide a blood sample, although I'm concerned that this may be a waste of time.    Help!"
