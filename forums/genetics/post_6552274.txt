"My mom, my brothers, and me all wake up, each morning in fact, with fevers that my grandma used to simply call \"wake up fever\". The strange thing is that none of us know what causes it and my mom has done much research on it. It even seems to run through my moms side of my family. Does anyone know what this might be?"
