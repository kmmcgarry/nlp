"I recently had a DVT for which I am on warfarin.    The specialist investigted causality and came to the conclusion that I have elevated Lp(a) and am hetrozygous for MTHFR.    I have done some research and am not terribly happy with my profile and future health prospects.    It seems to me that these two syndromes are additive putting me in a 'double jeopardy' position.    Please comment.    I am 50y/o, male, non-smoker with normal BP (115/70) and mildly elevated TC."
