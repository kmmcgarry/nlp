"Hi all, I was wondering if any of you had a amnio done carrying twins. I went in for my formal U/S for the 2nd trimester and one of the babies heart has a calcified spot which is a soft marker for down syndrome. The Dr. said I can do an amnio to make sure and have peace of mind but I know that there are risks for m/c when doing an amnio. It is doubled when u are carrying twins. I really don't know what I should do. I don't know anyone who has had an amnio done so I don't know who to ask.What do you guys think? My husband wants me to do an amnio because he doesn't want to have a chance of having a d/s baby because of the struggles he see's one of his cousins having. We have been trying to conceive for 3 years and after doing ivf 4x, it has finally worked and we are having twins and now we have to face a difficult decision of what to do. I don't want to hurt the babies.any advice would be greatly appreciated along with any experiences with having an amnio done. Thanks!"
