"hi i am 19 and work full time in the city. i am always active and doing something. i have noticed that for the past week i have been bleeding from my vegina and i am not supposed to have my period yet. i am worried it's something to do with my family history. my aunty anna had to have a hysterectomy because she has cysts on her ovaries and uterus. i am worried that i may have as well. the past few years i have gone to so many doctors and asked them why my periods are really heavy and pains that make me stay in bed for a week and scorching my skin with the hot water bottle to keep the pains away. i have to take really strong pain killers and i have to get up every hour to change my tampon. i am very worried because i am not sure what it is and i don't know how to fix it. the doctors changed my pill to a different one and    i have noticed that there is no change in pain or bleeding. my partner and i have decided not to have kids. i really don't have the time for children in my life full time.can anyone suggest to me what i should do.    anything will be very much appreciated. :)"
