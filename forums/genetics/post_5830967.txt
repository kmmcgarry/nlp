"my Grandaughters two bottom teeth came in by the time she was 4 months old & were normal but when her 2 top teeth came in they looked gray & clear. We were told she has no enamal on them. Will this affect her permanent teeth & will all her other teeth come in like that also?This discussion is related toborn without tooth enamel."
