"Hello, After 2 Miscarriages, my husband was recently identified as a    Balanced Reciprocal Translocation carrier between chromosome 1 and 10 46, xy,(t1,10)(q42.1,q26.3),    My Karyotyping came out normal. Our ob/gyn advised us to go with IVF and PGD , even though the procedure may give us more odds, it is super expensive and we can't afford it so I wanted to find out what our chances are of conceiving a normal child naturally and if we went with the natural route will Pre-natal screening be able to find out the abnormalities in the fetus? Please help any information on this will be greatly appreciated."
