"I'm 44 and pregnant. My doctor can not seem to explain to me what a positive result on the Integrated screen would mean for me. My age alone puts me in a high risk category for Down's Sydrome- I understand that. Will the Integrated screen automatically yield a high risk result for me because of my age alone? I'm also confused that she says that the highest risk the tests can yield is 1 in 100. This, to me, means a 1% chance of having a baby with one of the birth defects the screen is measuring. However, I keep reading-- and my doctor agrees-- the screen (without amniocentesis) has a 92% accuracy rate in predicting Downs Syndrome (or Trisomy 18 or a neaural tube defect). This is conflicting data to me. If I got a positive on the integrated screen, could I interpret that to mean there is a 92% chance my baby has one of the 3 birth defects? If so, why are the results reported in a ratio such as 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 250, etc.? If it's going to come out positive simply because I'm 44, it's just another worry for me to have with no value. Will you please clarify the numbers for me?"
