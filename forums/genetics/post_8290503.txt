"Hi my younger sister is 14 and she has severe lower back pain and mild hand an shoulder pain. She rates a 5/9 on the beighton scale but were not sure if her knees go back far enough so it might be 7/9. She isn't diagnosed but we did research and I was wondering if she could actually have this because there is no family history of anything like this. Soo yeah. Any responces would be fantastic."
