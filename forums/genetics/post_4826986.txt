"This is my first post so please forgive me (tell me where this should be posted, or just delete the post) if any of this doesn't really go here.I was recently diagnosed (1 month ago) with Ehlers-Danlos hyper-mobility type and they are in the process of seeing if I also have the vascular type due to my constant pneumothorax's and other symptoms.    I have been having chest and joint pain ever since I was 10 (Maybe younger, I have a bad memory with things like that), I'd had 2 separate \"Take-Home\" EKG's, once when I was 10 or 11, the next when I was 13 or 14, each time they came back saying \"We don't see anything that would cause pain\".    I was then referred to a chiropractor due to the fact I was always dislocating... everything, her diagnosis was \"You're just very loosely put    together, we should strengthen the muscles around your joints\"I tried my best but it hurt, bad, I had to quit my baseball team making up the excuse that \"I don't like my coach\" when in fact I was dislocating my shoulder and the pain was just getting worse, my father had become very good at \"resetting\" my shoulder for me, and couldn't pitch like I used to be able to, since then I had started pretending to my parents that I was getting better because I was scared they were going to find something seriously wrong with me at that point and that maybe I would grow out of it, a feeling which had stuck with me all the way up to the diagnosis of EDS, I had at that point been hiding symptoms from my doctors because of that fear (Yes, I realize its stupid but try going through what I went through).    The diagnosis of EDS was still made regardless because of the apparent physical evidence and family history, they had originally thought I had Marfan after my most recent pneumothorax.My question is:    There are certain things I have come to understand and accept, I need to know what kind of reaction I will get if I \"come clean\" to my geneticist and primary care physician about hiding symptoms so I wouldn't be diagnosed with something because I was scared to death of the answer. an answer that I may never had if I hadn't been taken to the hospital due to the pneumothorax."
