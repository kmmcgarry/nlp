"I just tested positive for this, and have the other abnormal results:    TSH 59.74,    T4 Free low (0.7); ALT 49; Creatinine 1.02; VWF RISTOCETIN CO-FACTOR of 244 and a CGA:vWf of 209.    I'm 61, do not smoke or drink alcohol.    What does all this mean in combination?    Is a family physician (internal medicine) usually a sufficient treatment provider for this, or should I see an endocrinologist or genetic counselor? I have no children. My mother had Hodgkins disease diagnosed when she was five months pregnant with me and died 5 years later, so I don't know much about her medical history.    I'm 3 years s/p gastric bypass and take Opti-Source multivitamins.Thanks.This discussion is related toa1298c mutation."
