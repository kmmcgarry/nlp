"I'm 20 years old, and have had rather severe eczema my whole life (diagnosed at 3 months)    I've been treated symptomatically with a number of different steroid medications, including Cortizone, Hydro Cortizone, and several other kinds that through the years, have proven not to work. I know that the body slowly builds up resistance to Coritzone medications, but I am at a stage where I cannot find any medications that work. I have several different types of eczema, the worst being Atopic Dermatitis, but I also have discoid    and dyshidrotic eczema that comes and goes, depending on the weather, my diet and stress levels. I have severe skin reactions in the form of painful, bright red, itchy rash/splotches when I eat/touch/come in any kind of contact with citiric acid (oranges, grapefruit, lime, lemon)    and have been hospitalized for autoeczematization ( reaction to infection in the form of full body eczema)I have eczema almost constantly in between my fingers, in the crooks of my elbows, behind my knees, and around my torso. I the summertime it also spreads up my arms and around the sides of my back (up high, under the shoulders. At its worst, I had it covering my entire back, torso, stomach and half of my face. No medication could calm it, and all types of moisturizers felt like fire being spread on me, even hypoallergetic ones. I'm afraid of having another huge breakout, and my eczema seems to spread more and more each week.How can i take control of this before it gets me hospitalized again?"
