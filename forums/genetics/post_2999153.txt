"I curious about Ehlers Danlos and weight loss. I was diagnosed with EDS when I was born and my mother has it as well. In the last year or so I have lost nearly 50 pounds. I feel great! But I was curious if there were any tips about pulling skin back in naturally. I am not gross and saggy or anything but I have not yet reach my goal and I was curious if it is common to have complications with the skin not pulling back in or and if there are any ideas how to help keep it in. I was also curious about weight and accuracy in meassurement of body fat percentage. As I said before I have been working on losing weight and getting into better shape. I had a body composition done to measure body fat. The results said I was within the \"acceptable/healthy\" range. But according to my BMI with weight and height, I am obese. I do not look obese but it seems as though I weigh more than one at my size and height might. I was curious if this is heard of or if I should just speak to a genetics doctor here and see what they have to say. I thought I would look into it this way first. Please let me know if there are any commonalities you have heard of or seen before. I am working on setting a goal. I am not sure what kind goal I should set for myself with lack of undertsanding of my measurments and what is actually expected of one with Ehlers Danlos or if this is not related at all. Any ideas?"
