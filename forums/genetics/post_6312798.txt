"hello, i am currently waiting for results of DNA testing for my possible daughter who is 11 MO old now. I am possitive on the date she was conceived if i am the father.. date would be FEB 15th conceived and the baby was born on DEC 7th. It is 42 weeks if you do the math. The baby was born almost 6 lbs and the mother says she was 38 weeks out of 40 when she had the baby. I am thinking maybe the pregnancy had a slow start or took longer bc the baby was born smaller? and I know the mother did smoke during the pregnancy so this may be the reason for the under weight. any help would be greatly appreciated as i am stressed and can not wait to find out if she is my child which I hope she is!"
