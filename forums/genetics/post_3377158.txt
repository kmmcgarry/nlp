"Hello,My sister and mother have both had breast cancer.    My mom at age 65 and my sister at age 43.    They both are positive for the BRAC2.    I have been tested and am also positive for BRAC2.    I have 3 of 5 first cousins from same family that are also positive, 2 of which have already had breast cancer in early 40's.    The 3rd one has already did preventive surgery and have both breasts removed and ovaries removed.    She did have pre cancer spots upon removal which they said would have turned into breast cancer in 1 to 2 years.    I have already had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.    However, have not had breast removed due to insurance coverage.    This would be considered preventive surgery and is not covered.    How important is it that I have my breast removed?    Thanks.This discussion is related toBRAC2."
