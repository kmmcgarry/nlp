"My wife and I just came back from our level II u/s and we were told that our baby has an echogenic cardiac focus and bilateral choroid plexus cysts.We were also told at the same appointment that our quad screening came back negative.All the limbs appear to be normal, the baby has his nasal bone, and was very active.In fact, he was predicted to be a week ahead of where we expected.    My wife is 18 1/2 weeks, and by the numbers, the data was saying we were really 19 1/2 weeks.Naturally, we are both confused and concerned.The doctor offered an amnio as an option because we have these two \"soft markers.\"I know that the amnio will tell us for sure, but I just don't know what these two markers being present mean for the odds of Down syndrome.Does anyone have any experience they can share?"
