"I suffer from panic disorder and just recently found out I'm expecting. I take Lexapro (10 mg) and although my Dr. doesn't foresee a problem with my taking it I'm afraid it will harm the baby. I'm also thinking about asking for a c section when the day comes for fear that I will suffer from post pardum depression. I'm also worried that although I haven't had any real morning sickness I have experienced mild headaches and dizziness. I read that it's a bad sign if there is no morning sickness. is that true? Lastly, will i pass on my panic disorder to my baby?Sorry for all the questions but worrying is what I do. Any answers would be appreciated.Thank You!"
