"I was diagnosed with having a 45x genetic disposition which is why I miscarry- Out of 30cells 3 or 4 had a missing gene the others did not. I was put on a high dosage of Folic Acid to help.I have option of doing IVF to get a healthy egg but do not have the funds. I am wanting to maximize my chances to have a healthy child, what can I do and what are my chances? I now take herbs that took my fsh levels from a 23 to 10.7 and still going down. Are there foods I should stay away from, foods I should eat more of?I can't seem to find anything on this- an article here and there but nothing how to treat it to get pregnant.Paige andreeThis discussion is related to47xxx/45x."
