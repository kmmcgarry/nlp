"does anybody know how i would go about getting hold of lab reports documenting my daughters diagnosis and should it be pretty straight forward?i have enquired already and was told the specialist would get back to me but they havent and i had a feeling i would have some trouble with this. i guess i would like to know the proper path to go to obtain the information i require before going in guns blazing"
