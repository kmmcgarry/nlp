"When I was pregnant, I had a two vessel cord. During my 20 week ultrasound, it was discovered that my daughter had complete AV canal malformation. The dr said that with those two conditions together, it was most likely that she had Down's. They did an amnio, which came back negative.Her heart defect partially healed before birth, to a partial AV Canal (or ostium primum ASD)As a newborn, she had GI problems. She had her open heart surgery in 2006 (when she was 6 months old) and her heart is now great.When she turned one year old, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started medication. Even with the low thyroid, she was not heavy at all....she is in fact, quite small for her age (she's almost four and weighs 32 pounds)She then developed ezcema(eczema)and has chronic constipation.She had obstructive sleep apnea, which was thought to be due to enlarged tonsils/adenoids. They were removed three months ago and we are waiting for a follow up appt with the pulmonary dr.She has no facial abnormalities and no developmental delays.    In fact, she is very smart.One dr very casually mentioned on a report that she suspects my daugther may have a connective tissue disorder but did not elaborate.I am just curious to why she has several health issues that are normally related to Down's Syndrome, and they even thought that she was going to have it...but she doesn't.Are they all just coincidental? Or could there still be an underlying cause?Thank you for reading!"
