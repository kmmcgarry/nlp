"Just wondering if anyone has heard of this antibody?    when I went to my 11week check-up, the doctor informed me that this antibody showed up in my lab work, she was not able to inform me of what it was, and is sending me to a specialist for more blood work and hopefully an answer to what this may be?    Just looking for a little help to see if anyone has heard of this?"
