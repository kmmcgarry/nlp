"I'm curious about my mole in the eye.It's on the left side,specifically just on the white part of the eye.I think they're 2.I'm afraid it could turn out into something bad.I'm just 13 so I can't go on my own to an ophthalmologist.And yeah,My mom has also a mole in her eye,same as mine.It's not changing size either."
