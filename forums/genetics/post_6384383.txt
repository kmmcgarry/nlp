"Hi, I have a question about whether it is worth looking into cancer genetics for this situation in our family:Aunt was diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer at 48 and ductal breast cancer at 59. Grandmother (aunt's mother) was recently found to have a 4cm tumor in her stomach at 81, still waiting to hear what kind of gastric cancer. This is a family of hispanic descent, from a place with high prevalence of gastric cancer. Aunt's husband was H Pylori positive and was treated for chronic gastritis. At least two sibings of grandfather (grandmother's husband) died of stomach cancer, no info available about the specific type. Aunt's children (ages 20 to 40) all have some or all symptoms of GERD, IBS, hemorrhoids, gastritis, esophagitis and receive treatment for it. Following grandmother's diagnosis, this whole situation seems to have many coincidences. We have heard that one relative diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer before 50 and other relative with gastric cancer qualifies for testing for the mutation for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (CDH1?) However, we know that from an ethnic point of view there is a higher risk of developing stomach cancer according to the literature. Given that the aunt's children already present gastrointestinal issues that are being treated for, we wonder this family should also pursue genetic counseling/testing and if there would be any benefit from it. In other words, if this kind of history warrants looking more into it. If it does, is it possible to test one/two of the cousins if neither the mother or grandmother are available and still obtain meaningful results?"
