"I'm new to the forum and was wondering if anyone here has a family member or other personal experience with Klinefelter's Syndrome. My 20 year old brother has it along with serious behavioral problems. I am wondering if others have the same problem and what has been tried regarding treatment. Thanks.Stephanie"
