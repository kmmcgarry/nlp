"I delivered a stillborn baby boy on May 14th 2008, he was 28 1/2 weeks.    To look at him he looked perfect.    The autopsy showed that the cord was coiled a little bit more than ususal.    My OB just called and has advised me I have an appt to see a genetic specialist on Jan 15th.    Does this mean there will be ongoing problems?    My spouse and I have been trying for another baby since August with no luck as of yet."
