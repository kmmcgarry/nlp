"Hello everyone, i joined this forum in hopes of talking with other members that have ehlers danlos syndrome.    Im so confused.    I was diagnosed 5 years ago, but have not been back to see the doctor due to sever panic attacks.    As of now i have a chiari 1 malformation, 2 herniated disks in my neck as well as kyphosis of the cervical spine.    The worst in my left shoulder.    I have had 4 operations on my left shoulder and they only thing that is left is a fusion.    My right arms dislocates, as well as both hips, and my right wrist.    My ankles are so unstable i can barely walk at times.    I do not take anything for pain, and wow day by day its getting worse.    What confuses me is i do not have the stretchy skin like some members do.    I do not dislocate constantly, its more just the sever pain in my joints, with them cracking all the time.    My ribs sound like a bag of potato chips if i move the wrong way.    So im curious to see what other patients symptoms are.    My grandfater died of a ruptured aortic anyerusm, and my dad had one reparied, and now has another.    No one in my family has a history of ehlers.    So after years of research i am so confuse.    I am a 27 year old male."
