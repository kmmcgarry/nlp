"I was researching on the internet about recessive genes and this site caught my eye. My friend has married her second cousin (since its ok to do so within her culture). However, she has realized that the guy√¢ Ä ôs grandma and her grandfather are siblings and his parents (mom n dad) are first cousins as well. However, no one in either side of the family has any problems related to genes. I know that the more u repeat inner marraiges the higher the chances are to get a recessive gene. So would there be a higher chance that her kids might be abnormal? Is there something that she can do to avoid this"
