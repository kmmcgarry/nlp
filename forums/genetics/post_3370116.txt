"This is painful for me to post, here goes. Hubby and i were seperated, 2 months. in that time was very lonely, met soemone, was intimate with him, during the same time was intimate with hubby, made up with hubby. We are back together. I am pregnant...I do not kno who is the father...I am sick over this, hubby and I were trying to have a baby, and now instead of being elated I am thinking about abortion...what if the baby is not my hubby's?? Should i have the baby anyway? Can someone tell if it is not his...blood tests? At birth?    Doctors out there please help.....what are the chances of blood testing etc,, reavealing this one day? I am trying to save my marriage, but I fear it may be over..as I want to do the right thing. Please advise."
