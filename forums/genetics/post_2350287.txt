"Hi,Can anyone who had a low AFP and low Ue3 and a high hcG and high Inhibin-A (on their quad screen) tell me how your situation resolved? The \"pattern\" is Down Sydnrome, but my numbers are very close to the desired 1.0 MoM across the board. What concerns me is the low AFP and high hcG result. I did have a vanished twin, but it seems inconsistent with that finding...Thank you."
