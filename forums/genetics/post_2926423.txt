"This has always struck me as odd; thought I'd get an expert opinion on this!I have strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes. Both parents have hazel eyes and brown hair. My brother has brown hair, brown eyes. They claim that one of my grandmothers had blue eyes, another had auburn hair.Is it genetically possible for me to have this hair color and eye color given this? Or an I just a statistical phenomenon? ;)Thanks!!!Genie"
