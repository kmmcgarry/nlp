"My husband and I want to have a baby real bad but there are a few things that are scaring us:1)When I was 18years I found out that I have a congenital anterior polar zonular cataract. I've had it all my life and it keeps increasing through the years.2)My husband has had asthma and recurring nasal polips all his life. He's had surgery in his nose many times ever since he was a little boy, but the polips just keep appearing.3)And the thing is..... we're second cousins. So this can be called inbreeding right? So if we had a baby, he/she could have genetic defects??....4) My parents were cousins too. So I was a result of inbreeding too... The doctors said that my cataract is a result of the fact that my parents shared the same blood. So, I know that genetic defects because of this is not a joke. I don't want my baby to go through any of this.My dad has had a retinal detatchment when he was 17 years old and has been blind in one eye ever since and the doctors said that that is hereditary too but luckily it skipped me but my children might have that.I've heard that the problems we have are all hereditary....and on top of that we're second cousins...What do you think are the chances that we could have healthy children?My parents are telling us not to have any children but to adopt because if by any chance the child is born with any defect, no matter how much we love him/her, the guilt will always be there.We really don't know what to do..."
