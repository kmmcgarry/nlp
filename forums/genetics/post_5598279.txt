"thanatophoric dwarfism is a lethal form of dwarfism that leads to the babes death minutes after birth from suffocation.I just went to see my OB and I have to go tuesday to the high risk fetal dev. clinic in London ON for a detailed US. My GP that I saw monday only told me that the report said \"highly suspicious of thanatophoric dwarfism\". My OB today read it to me and here is what it says:~head circ. normal~BPD normal~abdominal circ. normal~spine normal~nose and lips normal~no frontal bossing~femoral length 1.5 cm (4 weeks behind) also states that these are +/- 2 weeks~humerus 1.5 cm (3 weeks behind) also states that these are +/- 2 weeks~hypoplastic ribs~appears to be bell shaped thoraxmy OB also said that the clinic I had the US done at has been known to make mistakes in the past (we went there only beacuse it's the only clinic that will tell you the sex and we didn't know about the reputation). She also said that after they do the report they throw away all pics which is so not right. She basically said to relax, that it could be errenous. My husband is 5'10 (but has short legs) so my OB said he might just have short legs and they still could catch up a bit. Do you know how far growth needs to be behind for them to say without a doubt that there's a problem? do you think that maybe his short ribs may not indicate a real problem? Im just trying to figure out the chances that maybe things will be okay...My OB said to still have hope that my babe may still be okay...so scared for my little man and I know I can't do much but wait.normally, thanatophoric dwarfism is indicated by shortned limbs that are curved, shortned ribs, clover leaf skull, narrow rib cage, hydrocephly, flat spine etc....my babe has a couple of those (apparantly) but not all...what are the chances that maybe the first US is wrong??"
