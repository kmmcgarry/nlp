"So, I have never posted anything like this before but I am at a loss. My 7 year old son is seeing many doctors who are trying to figure out what is wrong with him. He is 7 years old, he is not on the growth chart for height or weight. He has basically quit growing as of 17 months ago but his growth has slowed down over the years. As a baby he was in the 75th percentile. His left leg is clinically shorter than his right, he has PDD-NOS, he has a benign tumor removed from his eye last month, has surgery starting the 23 MAY for bilateral undescended testicles, the dentist confirmed that his adult teeth are behind at least by 3-4 years and is not sure if they are still forming, he is getting a biopsy on his penis for another growth similar to his eye. He has seen a Endocrine team at UNC and they said that he is producing the hormones to grow so there is nothing more they can do for him. He is scheduled to see a gentic doctor in July among other doctors. He has had over 50 appts in three months and I am so tired of hearing \" We just do not know\". They believe he has a syndrome but do not know what kind. Has anyone experienced anything like this?? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"
