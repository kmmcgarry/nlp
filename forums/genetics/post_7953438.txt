"so first here is a little background: both of my parents have asthma, and all of my siblings and i have asthma. On my mom's side both of her parents smoked and she lived in the city but neither of her parents or her sister had asthma. On my dad's side he moved around alot because of his dad's job and none of his brothers or parents had asthma.So now to my question is it possible that my parents genetically passed asthma on to my my brothers, sisters, and i genetically even though it wasn't genetically passed on to them?"
