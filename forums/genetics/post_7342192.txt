"I'm a PCA for a very nice lady about 60 years of age. About 15 years ago she started to slowly loose the soft tissue in her body, her feet seem to be particularly bad as there is nothing but skin and bone and ligament there. The same with her hands. The most she's ever gotten with a diagnosis is fibromyalgia and shes been bounced to podiatrists and back doctors (forgot the word) like a ping pong ball for about 12 years. At this point I think her doctors pretty much given up trying to help her...I'm hoping that someone on here might recognize the symptoms. The largest seems to be the loss of soft tissue, the chronic pain, muscle atrophy(this may be due to the pain and lack of soft tissue on her feet making it difficult if not impossible for her to walk), weak immune system, nails on her feet are very thick and oddly shaped, she cannot produce her own tears and so needs lots of eyedrops, drinks lots of water and is still very dry, has constipation issues, and does not seem to absorb food very well."
