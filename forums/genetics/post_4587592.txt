"Okay, I need some advice. A little over ninteen years ago my biological mother went to a sperm bank, going through the necessary procedures and now I'm here :)My whole life I have been interested in who my biological father is and lately it has been on my mind so I want to try and find out his identity. A little information:My mother was artificially inseminated at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida.Have the laws changed since 1990? Can I find out who he is by simply calling or going to that hospital? What's my first step?"
