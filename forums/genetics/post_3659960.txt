"My mother had a rare cancer called Pheochromocytoma for 4 years. My mother had pheochromocytoma 2 years before having me and passed away from it when I was two years old...which means she conceived and gave birth to me while having this cancer. Even though Pheo is really rare, do I have a higher chance of getting it since my mother conceived me while she had cancer?"
