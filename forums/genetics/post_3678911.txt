"My Auntie suffered from Trisomy 22 miscarriages and gave birth to a child with Trisomy 22. My Grandad was the carrier of the Trisomy 22 chromosome.My father (brother of Auntie) had a blood test to check to see if he was a Trisomy 22 carrier which came back negative.Am I at risk of having a Trisomy 22 baby? Can it be passed down through the family tree?Thanks."
