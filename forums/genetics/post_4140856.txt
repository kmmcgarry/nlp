"I am 22 weeks pregnant. I am high risk considering preterm labor with my first child, also after losing a child at 20 weeks two years ago. So I go through meternal fetal medicine for my ultrasounds. Everything has been fine. However until this visit I was told that my 22 week old fetus had a light spot in his stomach. The doctor then said this my have come from him swallowing something in the womb,or he has an infection in his stomach. I am very confused after him telling me this I was told to wait a week. This was to see if the spot disappeared from his stomach. My question is do I need to see another doctor? If in fact this is an infection that he has won't this cause more harm to my son by waiting to do something about it? How can this be treated while he is still inside growing? Please help me out. I am worried sick!!!!"
