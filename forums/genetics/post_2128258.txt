"I am 27 years old and 6 weeks pregnant. I found out today I am MTHFR homozygous. My RE put me in a regimen of 4mg folic acid, 1mg b12, 100mg b6. I read a lot about people in my situations who are on blood thinners throughout pregnany. Both my PCP and RE are not concerned about this being an issue as I have low homocysteine levels.    Does this sound like standard response and attention to a problem like this? Should I seek another opinion? I haven't been to my OB yet...3 more weeks.Thank you!"
