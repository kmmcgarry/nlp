"Hi allI got pregnant the 1st time in may 09 during my 1st visit found out the growth was only 5 1/2 week had to have a D&C.Then i conceived again in nov 09.found heratbeat in the 8th week but during the 12th week found tht the baby's growth stopped at 8 1/2 weeks.I was also on progestrone since week 5 the 2nd time it was more like on a safer side.They did karyotyping for my 2nd miscarriage    and tdy got bck the results.Well i wanted it to be normal but unforunately nothing i wish seems to be happening .We found tht our babyhad turner's syndrome.We spoke to the Dr tdy and she said that it had got nothing to do with me or my hubby.It was just a random one again and she has recommended genetic counsellingbut now my question is could something be wrong with me or hubby .Or just like the dr we could still be perfect and this was just a random chromosome abnormality that happened the 2nd time too..What should i expect from a genetic counselling* Could this be even preventable.* This might sound stupid but would going for IVF/IUI or other treatment improve my chances of having a healthy baby b'coz they would place only the ones that are washed/cleaned etc .Im sorry if im wrong here i dnt know much about these fertility treatments.*If this treatment might increase my chance of having healthy baby would the Dr even recommend it.Or would it be recommended only in other scenarios and not in my case.The thing is i want to do something the 3rd time that would reduce my chances of having a misccariage.even if it means doing IVF/IUI ,but my only concern is even if im ready would the Dr recommend me.Btw Im 27 and hubby is 35 ,i have never been on any birth control pills or any mediacation for tht matter.Would like to hear some success stories or some hope.and also some infor about what all i need ask when i go in for my appt with the genetic counsellor and what would will i be expecting from them.Thanks"
