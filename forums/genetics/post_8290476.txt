"Hi, My younger sister who is 14 is having debilitating back pain and mild hand and shoulder pain. She is also rather flexible and has stretchy skin is some but not all of her body. I was wondering if she might have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome or some other conective tissue disorder? Should she get tested?"
