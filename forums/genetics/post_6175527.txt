"We just found out that our daughter has the 10q deletion. She just turned 7 yrs. We do not know what the next step is or where to look for advice. She has already been getting services for her developmental delays. She has already had 2 eyes surgery for strabimus. She has low muscle tone that we have done physical therapy. Her head is on the smaller size and she has the prominent nose bridge. We also found out that she has abnormal brain waves that may lead to seizures later in life."
