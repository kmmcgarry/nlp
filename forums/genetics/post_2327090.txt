"I was surprised to find recently that a friend tested positive for alleles that suggest an increased risk of prostate cancer.    I guess I shouldn't be surprised since his dad had an agressive prostate cancer at an early age, in his 60's.    The suggestion from the genetic counselors at UCSF is that he should start prostate screening at age 40.    Anyone else heard similar?    This is such a new thing, getting screened, that I wonder if anyone else is doing it?"
