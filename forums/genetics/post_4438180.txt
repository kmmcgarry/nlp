"Hi, I have recently been through a very difficult time.    My husband and I lost our first born due to the rare genetic disorder Trisomy 16q+.    He was delivered by emergency c-section at 36 weeks.    Right after he was born he was placed in the NICU.    He survived only 7 days, my husband and I both had our blood taken for further tests to see if we are carriers of this disorder.    Trisomy 16 has been one of the hardest disorders to find information on. Most of the information I have found about our situation with the q+ has resulted in stillborn or death.    Our results should be in this week, I am sitting on pins and needles waiting for answers.    If we are carriers of this disorder what is the likelyhood of being able to conceive a child without this disorder?    If we are not carriers, was this just a fluke and we can try again?    I am scared right now being so fresh in the loss, my mind has been racing with so many thoughts.    I really want to have a child but am afraid of going through another situation like this.Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon."
