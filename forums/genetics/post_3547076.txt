"I now have a wonder granddaughter (adopted) She is 2 1/2 and has classic PKU.    Can you please tell me which is more dangerous. High numbers from her blood test or low numbers. She is on the reccommended diet but her numbers even after being adjusted several times are over 400.    I live near Charlottesville, Va and have not been able to find any help groups etc just to teach me or give me answers.    Our precious, wonderful, seemingly smart and healthy little girl lives in Raleigh and is under Drs. care.    I am concerned about her numbers and I would like to know specifically what to high or to low numbers mean.    Help.    Thanks, Judith"
