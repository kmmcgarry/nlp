"Hi, i was wondering if anyone could help me, my daughter is 21 months old, and has just been diagnosed with perisylvian polymicrogyria, and recently has started taking seizures, i am finding this very difficult to cope with, my neurologist said he doesn't know how her development will come on, as she is sociable and has just started walking, could anyone give me any information on this condition, or seizures, as i am anxious all the time and need some reassurance that my baby will be okay.Thanks"
