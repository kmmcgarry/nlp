"I am 27 with Graves diease, B- blood and have 2 healthy boys, 7 and 1 yr.    Since my 1 yrs old, I have been trying to get pregnant.    I got pregnant in January and 13 weeks later miscarried at home.    I didnt get the rhogram shot.    In July I got l pregnant again, and 12 weeks later, miscarried again.    I didn't get the rhogram shot again.    This totally slipped my mind.    My mother brought it to my attention today and now I am totally freaked out.    I guess my questions are:    Can I still get the shot 9 weeks after the miscarriage? I still have breast milk?    is that making me miscarriage? Is it in my best interest to get the shot?    If I get pregnant again, is it true I will miscarry or have a still birth full term?    9-1-08 I had the worst period ever.    I was an emotional wreck.    I sleept 16+ hours a day.    One minute I would be laughing, next crying, and next a raging *****.    I was very distant and rude, mean , \"loveless\" to my husband.    Next anxiety kicked in real bad.    Whats going on?    Any advise will really help.    ......oh ya one more question,    this might sound stupid.....I read that rh- women and only birth male babies?    is this true?"
