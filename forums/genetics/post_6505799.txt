"Hello, I am doing my master project in the field human genetics and have a question that I really cant find answer on!I wonder how close two active genes can be to each other? My lab group have used the technique \"sleeping beauty\" to insert two genes, which are next to each other, into a animal model.We have checked for gene expression by looking on protein levels in different tissues for the two genes. But the \"problem\" is that if geneA has a high expression then geneB had an low expression, and vise versa.In some tissues we see that both genes have expression but then neither of them are as high as when only one of them was really active.I am beginning to think that maybe two highly expressing genes cannot be to close to each other and be \"maximum active\" at the same time?Maybe the unwinding and processing of the DNA for geneA will make it hard for geneB to be treated the same way because of the small distance?Thank you for your time, this is my first time I write at a forum like this and my english is not the best.Thanks for answer!/Anders"
