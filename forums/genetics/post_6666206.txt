"I don't even know where to start. I did the first trimester screening and I got a phone call this afternoon from a genetic counselor saying my risk for Down's was 1 in 6,265, which she said was good. Then, she tells me my risk for Trisomy 13 & 18 was 1 in 57. I was scheduled for a Level 2 Ultrasound this afternoon and they measured the fluid at the back of the baby's neck and there's too much fluid. The bladder is 3x bigger than what it's supposed to be. Now I have a 1 in 5 chance for a baby with Trisomy 13 or 18. My options? Do nothing. Wait until I'm 15 weeks to do an amnio. Or do a CVS which is similiar to an amnio. I opted to do the CVS because I could do it today. They stuck a huge needle in my stomach and took some of the tissue from the placenta. My risk for miscarriage for doing the procedure was 1 in 100. I now have to wait 7-10 days for the results which will tell us everything we need to know chromosomally. Chances are I will find myself not pregnant very soon.We also found out it was a boy.Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear. Glad to say I participated in the first trimester screening. Any words of wisdom are much appreciated."
