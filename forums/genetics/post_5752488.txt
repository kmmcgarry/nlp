"I have taken around 7 home pregnancy tests all have come up slightly positive, then I went to Dr. for their urine test both cam up negative.    After they took blood because I was persistent the bold test came back also positive.    This morning, 2 days after blood results I took another home preg, but this one came back negative.    I am still feeling the symptoms of pregnancy.    My question is, can pregnancy sometimes not be fully detectable through urine?"
