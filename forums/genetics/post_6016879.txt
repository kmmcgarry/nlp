"My 3 year old daughter was diagnosed with a rare chromosome abornormality of the 16th chromosome.I have been to a genetic doctor several times and so far there is no other known case reported with her chromosome duplication. I just saw this and thought id post about it on here to see if anyone is going through what i have been going through . we are just on a wait and see whast happens with my daughtger . her biggest delay is speech. we are very lucky that there is nothing serioulsy wrong with her. it still hurts though that she cant communicate with us .This discussion is related toRare chromonsonal deletion in 2-year-old?!."
