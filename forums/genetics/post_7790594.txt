"Hello, I have recently discovered that I have a sister from the same father but a different mother. What matters more? Being born from the same mother or from the same father. I have 2 half brothers from the same mother and we are nothing alike, buuuuuut they are. My half sister from the same father and I however are totally alike. She has 2 half sisters from the same mother but different father."
