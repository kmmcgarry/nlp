"I believe I am not the only one who has questions about passing a mental illness onto my child.    I am newly wed, and my husband and I are looking to start a family.    He is in his early 30's and has just recently been diagnosed with bipolar.    He did not have the best of life growing up, very traumatic and not in a loving family household.    We both checked the family history and there is no known case going back 3 generations of Bipolar in his family.    In my family, there is not any either.    His doctor told him it is environmental factors from when he was growing up may have caused this illness to come out.    My question is, what are the chances of passing it onto our children when there is no genetic factor thus far?    Any help would help me greatly.    Thank you!"
