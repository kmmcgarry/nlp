"I want to get pregnant and my mom carries the Incontinentia Pigmenti genetic disease. My fiance was diagnosed with the genetic skin disease folliculitis. He has had it since he was a baby. We are trying to pregnant and are having no luck. We have been trying for over a year.I am wondering by having both of these come together, could it cause me not to get pregnant?"
