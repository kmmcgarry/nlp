"A teacher at my school asked me to do some research on Turner syndrome for them.I was wondering why the absence of an inactive X chromosome has any effect. Surely if it is inactive, e.g. not expressed, it should not have any effect.A woman will normaly have 2 X chromosomes, 1 active and 1 inactive. Some may have 3 X chromosomes, 1 active and 2 inactive. This has no effect. So why does the absecne of this X chromosome that is not expressed have such drastic effects for females."
