"Hi there,I just began reading a book called Handle with Care, and it is about a little girl born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta.    It got me to thinking about this disease and I have started doing research on it.    The one question I have, but can't find an answer too is; if a baby has a bone break/fracture in utero, does it hurt them?    Can they feel the same pain that we can feel?Thanks for your help!"
