"I came back positive on on mutation of A1298C, does this means I could ide of a blood clot? Should I be drinking some kind of medication, even though, I am not pregnant. On my forst pregnancy I had my baby early at 34 weeks but other than that everything went normal. I am afraid of getting pregnant again, because of this mutaiton."
