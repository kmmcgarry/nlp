"Hi say for example some1 has a history of chronic otitis had a surgery ganmet (i think) inserted into their ears to treat chronic otitis and have had a history of bronchitis... is this than related to x-linked agammaglobulinemia?If so can he produce antibodies for hiv?Also, i understand that x-linked agammaglobulinemia is usually diagnosed when one is young because of recurrent symptoms. so my qns if if some1 experienced the above when his young will he fall ill throughout his whole life if hes not treated or is xlinked agammaglobulinemia causes only one to be susceptible to infections only when he is young?"
