"Hello everyone! THanks for taking the time to read my issue..    I will make it short to the point(i tend to go on & on)One day i decided to read a book call \"Heart Healthy revoltion\".. It talks about a special diet(lots of fruit/vegis),vitmans b6-b12-folic, & HOMOCYSTEINE levels..    Well I have always been in bettee than average shape(workout, eat right, no artifical sugars, soda, etc), but could lose a nice 20lbs.. Well i got on this diet and lost 20lbs...    I felt greatSo then I decided \"Boy I should get my HOMOCYSTEIN checked.. SO i did and it was OFF THE CHARTS 20.1...I am 36 soI figured if i dont do anything about this it will be 40 within the next few years or so...anyways I read all this stuff on the NET \"Its not to late LOWER YOU HOMOCYSTEINE levels-- Take SUPER HIGHdoesages of SAFE B12,B6, & FOLIC acid- THIS WILL SAVE U!\".....Anyways I went out abd bought 120$ worth of all this LIFE    EXTENSION HOMOCYSTEINE reducing vitamins..., butthen I said to myself \"Hey you should do a VITAMIN BLOOD test to see where are your levels....WELL.. I check my b12, B6 and folic.... MINE WHERE OFF THE CHART HIGHB12- 486 (NORMAL)B6 - 67 (HIGH NORMAL IS 20)FOLIC - >26    (HIGH NORMAL IS 5)I was SHOCKED!! cause my BLOOD levels are ALREADY HIGH ENOUGH, plus i have heard about B6 TOXIC levels..Anyways I checked with my CARDIO DOC and he said you are probably have the 2 GENES that cause your LEVELSto be HIGH HOMOYSTEINE and EVEN IF U TAKE HUGE DOSAGES OF B6,b12, folic IT WOULD ONLY REDUCE A FEW POINT AND IT COULD BE BAD FOR YOU HEART!!What am i suppose to do!! Please any advice... I read other post and VERY FEW POEPLE who have HIGH HOMOCYSTEINE LEVEL even say what their LEVEL are .. Well I am 36 , healthy, great cholestrol, MY CRP- c reactive is .3 (WHICH IS SUPPER GOOD), BUT MY HOMOCYSTEINE LEVEL is 21...I am a mess...    I eat super clean and dont do anything unhealthy.......    I know there are other uspplements likeTMG that help, but apparetly my BODY has good levels ...Any suggestions or stories of other people in the same issue.... I am planning on getting my GENES check just tosee....     Maybe it is the NIACIN supplemtns if took! Maybe i am to healthy ?Thanks for listening to me!!Don"
