"I'm hoping someone can help me out.I'm pregnant and have bilateral cervical ribs. I have read about the increased risk in childhood cancers in children who have cervical ribs. So i have two questions.1 the cancers that are increased, are they something that cord blood/stem cells would help?2 Can you see if a baby has cervical ribs during a prenatal ultrasound?Thanks"
