"Hello,I am 5 weeks pregnant and my moms grandmother was a twin, my moms mother was a twin, and my moms sisters are twins. What are the chances i will have twins? I have    a sister that is older than me but is not married. Will she have the twins or will either of us. I know you can't tell me if i am having twins, i was just wondering if i had any chance of having twins. My mother and her sisters did not have twins. Thank you for answering!!Nykki"
