"Hi all,I am new to this forum and looking for a little help. I was diagnosed with being homozygous for MTHFR C677T. I also have a pituitary microadenoma measuring approxiamately 4-5 mm. Does anyone know what the treatment protocol should be? Can ASA and/or anticoagulation (lovenox/heparin) be given in regards to my pituitary microadenoma. My MRI also showed a probable venous angioma. I have gotten conflicting answers from my MDs. Thanks."
