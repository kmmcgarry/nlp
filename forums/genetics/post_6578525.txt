"I have a 7yr old daughter that when she was born she had a conginitial curly toe (her fourth toe) on her left foot. she didnt beginning walking till ayear and half old. Within the the last 2yrs we have noticed her left foot is not growing as fast as the other it is now about 2 sizes different. i just thought it was caused by her toe. Within the last month she has pointed out that her left leg is shorter as well. I took her to the doctor and he said it is 2cm shorter and sending her to a podiatrist. I was wanting to know more about it before I go and I found Hemihyperplasia could this be the problem?? Or is it caused by her toe??"
