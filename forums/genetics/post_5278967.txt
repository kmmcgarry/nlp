"I am interested in finding out if anyone has had the same experiences as me. I was born with no enamel on my teeth. This has went as far back as the 1700s in my family. The first child is always born with no enamel (as meantioned earlier we can trace this back to are Irish roots in the 1700's. We have straight, strong teeth but we have no nerves. I was told as a child that I couldn't do anything until my adult teeth were fully grown which occurs when you around 18 years old. At that time I spend hours and hours in the dentist office capping my teeth. My son was born with this disorder so i guess it just hit home with me because I don't want him to go through all of the issues that I have faced (such as low self esteem and people thinking that you didn't take care of your teeth). Anyways, I want to know if there is a known cause for this? Where did it come from and why is it the first born always is born with no enamel and sometimes the second child, but not always. Any information or experiences would help me greatly.Thank you!!This discussion is related toborn without tooth enamel."
