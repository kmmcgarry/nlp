"I am wondering if there is any correlation between pineal cysts, pituitary microadenomas, bilateral kidney cysts, and a spinal schwannoma? I have been diagnosed with all these masses as well as Liddle's, Hashimoto's, possible Sjogren's, and possible ADPKD. I have a history of kidney stones, osteoperosis, severe migraines, ammenorhea, low weight/weight loss, fatigue and insomnia, hypertension, muscle weakness, possible arthristis, and so on and so on. I have had a laminectomy of T10-L1 to remove the schwannoma and am watched closely for all the other masses. I have seen every specialist under the sun who tells me I am a complicated case! I am tired of being poked and prodded...medicated and over-medicated for my symptoms...and called crazy even when all the labs and imaging comes back with abnormalities!! Please help with any suggestions!!!My only other concern is for my 2-year-old son who displays the same delayed growth patterns. He is healthy and developmentally ahead, but is not growing. Perhaps something genetic?"
