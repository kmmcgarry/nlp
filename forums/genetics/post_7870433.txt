"I find it odd that I can find nothing on the web about white birthmarks. So the closest thing I can find to my own birthmarks would be vitiligo...the vitiligo has cafe au late spots inside of them...so it looks a bit like swiss cheese (lol) I'm white and the white spots are very noticeable. Along with the darker spots. They are located on my legs. They spiral down and around my leg. I have a large white patch on my stomach also.My grandmother has the birthmarks, she has had 6 children, 17 grandchildren and 10 great grandchildren...I just find it odd that me and my first child are the only ones who have these birthmarks. What are the chances? They are almost identical to mine. Why can I not find this type of birthmark on the web anywhere?"
