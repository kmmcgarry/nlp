"I√¢ Ä ôm hoping that someone here with knowledge of / specialty in genetic syndromes can help me identify this underlying condition. The symptoms I have are deteriorating slowly, and I√¢ Ä ôm very scared by the fact that I do not know which syndrome is responsible, or what the outcome will be. Please help me; my symptoms are very real    :cry:I've been enduring these strange health problems for quite some time; the root cause of which I believe (coming from a background in science) is due to a genetic defect. I have quite a number of strange facial features & dental abnormalities, many of which I have noticed are attributed to various syndromes resulting from chromosomal aberrations (I.e. duplications, deletions, inversions, etc).No doctor I√¢ Ä ôve previously seen cared enough (or knew enough about this topic) to effectively find any syndrome which fit the criteria of symptoms. I have since lost my medical insurance and cannot afford to consult with a geneticist or undergo genetic testing.I have a high IQ of 140. I have been diagnosed some time ago with Asperger√¢ Ä ôs syndrome (autism spectrum disorder), which is the cause for my high I.Q. I am 23 years old and have a background in biochemistry. I am 6√¢ Ä ô tall and weighing in at 270 lbs.FACIAL ANOMOLIES:-    Nearly-flat back of skull-    Frontal bossing-    Unusually large head-    Long, narrow face-    Bird-like facial features-    Drooping eyelids-    Small jaw-    Small mouth-    Unusually shaped & thin upper lipDENTAL SYMPTOMS:-    Many adult teeth never developed (have many baby teeth)-    Delayed eruption of adult teeth-    Loss of tooth enamel-    Pitting in several teeth-    Deep grooves in lower front teethNEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS:-    Ghosting of visual field (recent)-    Simple partial seizures [temporal lobe epilepsy]-    Tinnitus (intermittent)-    Multiple chemical sensitivity-    Phantom odors & tastes (olfactory hallucinations)-    REM behavior disorder (violent sleep behavior)-    Shooting nerve pain-    Lack of fine muscle coordination (tremors)ENDOCRINOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS:-    Marked testosterone deficiency-    Brief incident with manifestations of Cushing√¢ Ä ôs syndrome, which left substantial scarring from stretch marks.-    Substantial weight fluctuations (gain or loss)-    Gynecomastia-    Hypothyroidism-    Thyroid noduleSKELETAL SYMPTOMS:-    Arched neck-    Extremely wide back with asymmetrical shoulder length (difference of 2√¢ Ä ù)-    Small hands in proportion to body sizeGASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS:-    Abdominal distention-    Hepatosplenomegaly-    Gluten intoleranceIMMUNOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS:-    Susceptibility to infections"
