"Hello,I want to know what my chances are of having twins.    My grandmother on my mothers side had a set triplet and a set twin and her sister had a set of twin also. On my fathers side one of his sisters had a set of twin and one of his aunt had a set of triplet.    I wanted to know, what are the possibilities of me having either triplets or twins? Thanks."
