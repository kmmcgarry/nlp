"Please someone give me some answers. I'm at a lost . Frist allow me to say , i'm writing about my Son. he is 34. His Father died of HD . We have no other info. on that. We just found this out a few years back. Now My son is starting to show signs of HD. I'm of course worried about this as his wife is also. We are thinking it's time for testing. He has a family of five . and we need i believe , to know something so we can make arrangements. I'm so lost as what or where i should start. My son has made his Dr. Aware of this and he does not seem to even take notice of it or want to talk on it. I think we may need another Dr. that understands this and talk with them. Anyone have anything they can share with me, i'd be truely greatful.Worried MotherThis discussion is related tohuntingtons disease."
