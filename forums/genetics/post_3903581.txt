"I'm not really sure what this means.    I have donated blood for 20+ years, I was in the 5 gallon club in Colorado and have given 1 gallon in Oklahoma, I have O- and my screeneing for some common virus was negative so they loved my blood for the infants.I received a letter yesterday stating that my blood samples were positive for HLA.    The letter states that these antibodies will not affect my overall daily health so I don't need to see my physician.    Perhaps I'm a bit of a paranoid- type but this leaves me with, how did this happen and if I can no longer give blood it must be bad and could this be the reason for some family health issues?    Please give me some good information as I have only had this letter for about 12 hours and my mind is spinning.Thank you!"
