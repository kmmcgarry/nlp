"My son was born on August 14, 2003.    The last day I ever had intercourse with his mother was November 3, 2002.    I have tried many online calculators and it seems impossible for him to be my son.    The date of conception on the calculator was Nov.    22.    Can you have a deviation of 20 days from the date of estimated conception??"
