"I am 25, am experiencing Huntington√¢ Ä ôs disease symptoms.    I am in home care. My family is one of the few in the world who have early onset. I was a Nurse Assistant    before I got sick. I made a positive, comprehensive website. It has a blog, Articles, videos, care giving tips, research,    ways to fight brain fog, myths, my story, my families√¢ Ä ô story, history, ways to have a positive testing experience, and ways to cope. I also put on there the poems I got published in the horizon. I now have my personal support group. I have won more awards in a short period time than any other site, 85.31    are international Awards. I am on the Top Disability/ Disease Blog List. I also have won the Disability Network Award.http://heatherdugdale.angelfire.com/"
