"HiWhat is the difference between a genetic counsellor and a dr of maternity fetal medicine.are they one & the same or is there any difference.My ob/gyn referred me to a Dr in maternity fetal medicine after the results of my 2nd miscarriage came with chromosomal abnormality. i thought she would refer me to genetic counsellor so was wondering if both are the same."
