"My boyfriend and i both have low blood pressure and his was inherited from his father where all his other 2 siblings are inhertied too. As for mine, it was passed down from my grandmother to my mum and to me. I've heard that if both parents have hypotension, their baby is most likely to be unhealthy. Does that mean that it's impossible for my boyfriend and i to have a complete and healthy family?"
