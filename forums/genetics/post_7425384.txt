"Can anyone tell me if ALL people with Williams Syndrome have cardiac abnormalities and some degree of mental retardation? My daughter seems to fit all other symptoms; she has learning differences,or disabilities, but isnt mentally retarded. she also has never been diagnosed with pulmonary stenosis or any other cardiac condition;mind you, she has never been tested,, as there havent been any symptoms of cardiac involvement....but most other symptoms seem to fit her to a \"T\" ...so i am wondering if the lack of having these two major components would exempt a dx of Williams syndrome?"
