"I was raised in a small town(population 1972).    There is a male that is around the same age as my oldest brother, and is from the same town. He and my oldest brother look exactly alike.    We cannot tell them apart.    I have mistaken this man for my brother quiet a few times.    Other people who know us, ask the same question.    Why do the two of them look so much like each other.    We have aked family members over and over , and is not getting any answers that make sense.    How likely is it that two people from the same small town, and grew up together look so much alike, but are not suppose to be related to each other?"
