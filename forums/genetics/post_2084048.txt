"i never thought of it being a concern, until my wife got pregnant. my paternal grandparents are first cousins that married back in europe. they had relatively healthy 6 kids (including my father). my aunt however had a son with some type of mental retardation. he was the only one, as the other 5 uncles and aunts all had healthy children. now of my generation of cousins i am the first to have a kid. should i have any concern with our baby having any defects? is there anything i should ask my wife's doctor to look for?"
