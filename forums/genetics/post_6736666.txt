"my daughter is 8 and recently turned 8 but is growing black hair down there and her breast are showing a lot.    we saw an endocrine specialist who took blood extensive background and examined her hand.    they said her hand was that of a 10 year old.    and that she is in early puberty and estimate that she will begin her period in aug 2010 to aug 2012.    they want to do lupron shots once a month. i have had so many things said, from insomnia, to night sweats, weight gain, stunting their growth, i just don't know what to do can you please help me.thanks."
