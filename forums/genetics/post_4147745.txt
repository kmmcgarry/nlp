"I experience symptoms of \"Asian Flush\", but am a caucasian female. Although it is rare, I have experienced redness, warmth and difficulty breathing when drinking alcohol. I have also noticed that it occurs when drinking certian types of alcohol or mixed drinks, such as cheap liquor or margaritas. I have read that it is genetic and strongly linked to esophageal cancer. As a 25 year old, I have been drinking fairly regularly for over 5 years and normally really enjoy it. I am hoping that it is an allergy as opposed to a deficiency in ALDH2, which is predominantly an Asian trait. Where can I find out what it is that I have or how to get tested for it? Thanks."
