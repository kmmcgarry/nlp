"My daughter has INV DEL and DUP of 8p. She was diagnosed in 2006. Myself, son, and husbad have been tested and all come back negative for chromosome abn. My son is perfectly healthy, the only thing they can say was different about pregnancies was that I took Effexor XR 150mg during pregnancy with my daughter I was wondering if    anyone else has same problem from SSRI or any meds taken during pregnancy!"
