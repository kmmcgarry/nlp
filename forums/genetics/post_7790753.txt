"Im 35 wk pregnant and I was just told that my baby girls long bones are measuring about 5-6 weeks behind and her head is about week ahead. We had 3 u/s done and they all have different number but all with in the same range. They can't tell if head is prominent or if the nasal bone is depressed. Her hands and feet seem fine with no other indication other then short long bones 5-6 wk and head 1wk ahead. They gave us dx of achondroplasia. I am reading a lot of stories about inaccurate measurements and false dx. Anyone has a story similar to ours please tell us. And also tell us what happened once baby was born. We pray this is all mistake and God gives us a normal baby."
