"I'm 34 weeks pregnant and just had an ultrasound... my doctor stated that the baby was 5 lbs and 8 oz and everything was measuring normal except for her femurs... they were only in the 16th percentile... I'm worried because my husband is 6'3\" and I'm 5'9\".... does this mean she has a form of dwarfism? I meet with a Parenatologist next week... but I'm so stressed....has this happened to anyone?"
