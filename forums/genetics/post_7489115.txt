"my husband is 43 and he seems to be having some kind of awake seizures according to his primary care physician.    he will be fine one minute and the next it is like he is looking straight through me, he may talk and make all the movements like his normal self but he will b very agitated and ill sometimes down right irate and mentally abusive.    when he finally comes back to his normal self he won't remember anything that has happened during the episode or before it.    it is really scary and i truly need some advice as to what to do for him and where to start as far as docters are concerned.sincerely,heather ballenger7063383728"
