"Hi, I'm 28 years old but as you can see from my photo I look an awful lot younger. I have been told by a number of people that I only look 15/16 years old (from this photo) and I agree with this as I'm sure you will. I also can't grow any sort of proper beard. When I was 18 years old people told me I only looked 15 and they still do 10 years on so technically I've hardly aged.What makes it even worse is the fact I am 6' 3\" tall (I've made sure you can't tell this from the photo) which makes me look like an overgrown child. My height and the fact I have an average build are the only reasons people think I'm older. I've never had a girlfriend, am still a virgin and people mock the way I look.Why do I have a child's face if I am so tall and generally, what could be wrong with me ?Any reply is greatly appreciated,D."
