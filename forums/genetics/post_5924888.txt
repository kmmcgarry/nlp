"Hello everyone.I have a 4 year old daughter. She was diagnosed en utero with a heart defect called atrioventricular canal defect, which partially healed itself before her birth to be a optium primum ASD.she also had reflux as ain infant and was dx with failure to thrive as a newborn.she also has hypothyroidism, and ezcema(eczema)and vitiligo, and chronic constipation.I was told three years ago that she may have a connective tissue disorder.I now suspect she may have Williams Syndrome, but we have not done any tests.She has started to complain constantly of pain. Mostly in the back, but sometimes in the arms, legs, or even hips.could this be from a connective tissue disorder, WS, or something else?Thank you for reading."
