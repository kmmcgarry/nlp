"How important or unimportant is my ethnicity / genetics in dealing with any undiagnosed medical problem? I have mild Lupus and I have recently been experiencing neurological and/or autoimmune symptoms that my doctors are having trouble diagnosing.In all the years I have seen physicians for this and other routine things no one has ever asked me about my ethnicity and yet genetics have come a long way. I have never volunteered this information either.    I figured that if they didn't ask me then it was unimportant at the time.Both my husband and I are from uninterrupted (as far as I know) , Ashkenazi Jewish descent. We live in a rural area where physicians wouldn't necessarily expect that lineage. Should I be disclosing that on my own to our physicians. I especially want to know for our kids sake."
