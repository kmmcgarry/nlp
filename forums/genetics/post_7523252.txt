"Hi All;I have miscarried 2 times. When did karyotype test found the following.\"Cytogenetic analysis shows the presence of 2 cell lines, first one is the lossof 1 sex chromosome resulting in 45,X cell in 3 of 22(13.6%) cells analyzed\".\"Second contains 3 X chromosomes, 47,XXX in 2 of 22 (9.1%) cells analyzed. Thisindividual is therefore mosaic 45,X/47,XXX\".So I think rest of the cells 17 of 22 are normal?and finally result is,Result:45,X[3]/47,XXX[2]/46,XX[17], abnormal Female Karyotype, with 45,X/47,XXXmosaicism.Is there any chance for me to have healthy babies?thanks"
