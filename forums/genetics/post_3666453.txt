"Hello,I was warned that there is a risk of complications if I get pregnant again and am trying to figure out exactly what those risks are to me and the baby before I schedule a tubal ligation. My first pregnancy was totally normal. (My husband and I are o+ blood types) My second pregnancy showed an -e antibody. Regular blood work was done and the numbers never rose above 1:1. My sons biliruben levels jumped very fast after he was born and he was under bili-lights for five days.I was told the antibody issue becomes a larger problem with each pregnancy and there is a good chance I may have a miscarriage if pregnant. If I did make it to 9 months, there may be more severe complications with the baby. He suggested we not have any more children. This is fine, but I am a person who needs more details before making my decision. I do not need anything sugar coated but want to educate myself as much as possible. What is the worst case scenario? My OB suggested I see a perinatologist, but the nearest one is over 3 hours away.Thank you for your time,"
