"I know that I have the HLA B27 gene (And Ankylosing Spondylitis to go with it), my question is:What are the chances of passing this gene on to a child.    I am a 25 year old white male (otherwise healthy).    I would like to know so I can make informed decisions on potentially starting a family.Thank you"
