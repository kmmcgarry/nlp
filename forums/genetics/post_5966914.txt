"Hi,my name is Danielle,I know this may sound extremely stupid but when i was born which was,1992 The hospital,doctors,etc detected that i have an \"unknown hemoglobin\"supposidley whatever it was was nothing that they had seen before and they were unable to determine what it was.They did a test on my mother and father to see who the carrier was and my mother was the carrier.Scientists and my pediatrician wanted me to send my blood to California so they could do further testing,but my mother didn't want anymore blood taken from me because i had already had alot of blood taken and i guess when i was a baby she didn't want me to look like a \"pin cushion\".This is all serious,no joke,no scam.The reason i'm emailing you is because i was wondering what this thing,in my blood,that is unknown could possibly be,i have been interested lately in attempting to send my blood to be researched somewhere again,but i don't know where.if you could write me back with some info or anything please do! thanks!"
