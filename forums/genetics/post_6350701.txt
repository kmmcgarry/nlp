"I have M.E.N.1.    It has gone into where my adrenals are not functioning. I must take    steroids    daily to survive. Is there any other way, because I also have severe osteoporosis, due to having to have my parathyroids removed, and I know the steroids are not helping my bones. Also, what do I do about the ever present fatique? Oh, also, the weight gain from the steroids!!!!!"
