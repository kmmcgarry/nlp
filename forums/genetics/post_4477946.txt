"My husband's sister has Factor V Leiden, takes coumadin, and has had multiple clots...pretty much a worse case scenario situation. My husband says that he has Factor IV Leiden. I can't find any research on this, much less that it even exists. He has never had a clot and is fairly healthy. Does he need to be doing anything other than taking an aspirin a day?Thank you."
