"I was diagnosed with anemia and my GP referred me to a hematologist because my hemoglobin level was 9.7, but my ferritin levels where 305 an that concerned her.I just received my blood test results from my hematologist yesterday and my hemoglobin is up to 11.7 and everything else looks normal, but my red blood cells are small. So she wants me to come in for one more blood test because she not sure if it is Thalassemia. She said that it usually effects African Americans, Mediterraneans and Asians and I do not fit any of those I am Caucasian so I am a little confused and curious as to how I would get this. I would appreciate any help anyone can offer. Thanks"
