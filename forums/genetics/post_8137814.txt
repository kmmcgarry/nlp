"A few months ago my son who is 18 was diagnosed with PCV and last week after having an MRI done, we've been informed that he also has Diffuse Cerebral Atrophy... This is all so overwhelming and very scary, but I was wondering if perhaps anyone knew if it was common for the two to run together? My son has already had phelbotomy once, he know's that he needs to stay away for heat and cold for extended periods of time or he could have a stroke or heartache, drinking lots of fluids too. But now with this new diagnosis, I'm frazzled... We have an appointment with a neorologist next week, so I guess that I will find out more than and am praying that the rest of the tests that my son has had done, doesn't find more for him to be even more depressed. We live in the Columbus, GA area and I'm researching support groups as well.Does anyone else out there have these two illnesses as well, and how are you coping with it?"
