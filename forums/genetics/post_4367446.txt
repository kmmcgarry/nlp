"Hi. I am 23 years old, and I am pregnant with my second child. My boyfriend and I went for a routine ultrasound when the baby was 20 weeks; however, we were told the baby has cystic hygroma as well as hydrops. It was devastating to hear the doctor tell us that the baby will more than likely die within the second trimester. The very same day the doctor did an amniocentesis; we received the news just this week informing us that our baby girl has Turner's syndrome. I'm now at 22 weeks, and I am concerned of the outcome given the fact the doctor told us that she has a 100% chance of not living past this month. How many babies can live through the problems she has? If my boyfriend and me eventually want another child, what precautions or suggestions from doctors should we follow?"
