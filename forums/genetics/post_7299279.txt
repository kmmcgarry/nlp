"hi,I'm a 22 year old male who will suffer from lethargy, mild disorientation, mild confusion, and stoner-like eyes when what I'm assuming what is a metabolic disorder is induced. To induce it, all i need to do is eat a normalish diet without enough meat or unhealthy fast food-like foods. A five-guys hamburger or a mc-donalds egg mcmuffin will rapidly reverse symptom after a nap.    I get confused and disoriented if I take omega-3 fatty acid (fish oil pills). I also get similar if not worse symptoms from abstaining from bread based carbohydrates for too long ie. modified atkins diet. I'm pretty sure i have a metabolic disorder - possibly related to fats - somewhere in the chain - but I havent been able to pick out which one is cured by a 5-guys burger."
