"HiAbout two weeks ago my baby's humerus and femur measured short in the ultrasound. Yesterday i went to see my doctor, and she told me that according to the results of the ultrasound my baby was dignosed with skeletal dysplasia, with a growth retardation of 5 percentile in both the humerus and the femur, i haven't had the genetic test to test if this is 100% true. I researched on the internet and i found that there are more than 380 types of skeletal dysplasia.What could be the type of the skeletal dyspasia affecting my baby?"
