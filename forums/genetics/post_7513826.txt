"I was diagnosis in 2004 with this and was put on cerifolin for years to build up my iron in my blood.    I was taken off after 10 years (I think).    Now my cancer doctor (I do yearly follow ups yet since 1996) has me getting Infed IV therapy monthly as he says I have iron defienent anemia.    I'm questioning whether my doctor is treating this right?    Has anyone else run into this?    My neurogolist has been treating me for tias, narcolepsy, a little diamentia, miagranes, back pain, exhaustion, arthritis, all kind of things.    I've have MRI, MRA, EEG, EKG, PET scans, CTA scans, sleep studies.    Oh, I have a CPAP machine I can't stand.    And he is treating me for restless leg problems too.    Any help or sugections, Please????"
