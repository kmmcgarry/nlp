"In November 2008, I had to terminate my little boy due to bilateral renal agenisis.We went through genetic counseling but all the chromosome tests came back normal. What does this mean? What are the causes of this? What are the statistics of having another baby with this? (I already have 2 older girls)I'm just so frustered and can't find ANY answers!!!This discussion is related tobilateral renal agenesis."
