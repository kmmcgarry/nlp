"Dear readersI am 21 years of age now. I am a known alpha-thalassemia trait (2 gen damaged) since 14 years old. My blood count (HB) changes from time to time, sometimes within the reference value (e.g. 13.6 - normal), while on other occasions, it falls below the reference value (e.g. 12.3 - low).Since young, I always feel tired easily, even when not participating in strenuous exercises. I feel weak and restless most of the time. Besides, I feel sick if I do not have my meals on a consistent basis.There are occasions when I was exercising, I lose my breath quickly and feel extremely breathless like asthma attacks.In addition, there are also occasions where I have fainted from jogging. Many would say that I have pushed myself too hard. But in actuality, I was jogging at my comfortable constant pace.Symptoms of fainting:- Hearing of both ears dampened as the surrounding sound becomes unclear and distorted;- Eye vision is affected. My eyes start to see dots of different colours. Afterwhich, my vision turns blurrish.- When I stopped from jogging or running, I cannot maintain my balance from standing. As such, I will fall onto the ground.- Half conscious.I am currently serving my national service in a combat fit unit. Training is very tuff, filled with strenuous exercises like running long distances, and this medical condition of mine is seriously affecting my training. I feel very weak and tired.I understand that as an alpha thal trait, we will normally not experience any symptoms, and it in most cases should not affect our health much. However, I am experiencing these symptoms regularly.My hb changes regularly. It has gone below the reference point from time to time. Doctor said that my hb does not qualify for me to transfer to a unit of light duties.What should I do? I really could not cope with the training.I hope to hear from you soon as I need a reply urgently.Thank you.RegardsThis discussion is related tothalassemia minor."
