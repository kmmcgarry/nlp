"i have inherited familial hypercholesterolemia and thin basement membrane disease. i am only 25 and have had 4 random surgeries: cystectomy, sinus, fasciotomy, lap chole.    i have some other vague symptoms going on now that are showing autoimmune disorders but no doctor can give me a diagnosis. they all seem perplexed by my history. they won't prescribe anything until they know for sure but they don't seem to have much of a plan to make them sure. neuro says \"could be MS\" rheumo says \"could be lupus or antiphospholipid\". currently i have numbness, dizziness, fatigue. hx of chest pain on inspiration and joint pain. MRI showed small white lesions only without contrast. I feel like there's a missing piece to everything going on but no one can touch it. i am very sick and very frustrated. about to lose job b/c i don't have a diagnosis for what keeps me out of work. can't drive because the dizziness is so bad. i am tired of being turned from doctor to doctor, its been years with lots of nonspecific tests coming out positive. any suggestions on where to turn? would a geneticist be able to find something easier or more specifically?"
