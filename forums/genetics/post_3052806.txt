"My brothers ages 27 and 30 have extremly high levels of Creatine Kinase which was found 20 years ago and was thought to be MD (Beckers). Today neither of them have any signs of MD, in fact they are both extremly active and healthy. Recently they both went in for yearly physicals and this high level showed again. Both have undergone liver ultrasounds which are fine. The older one went in for an MRI and we are awaiting the results. Our GP is totally out of his league and does not even know what direction to point them. As the older sister and only other sibbling, I went in for blood work and do not have this high level, could this be genetic running in the males? What type of specialist should we look to see to try to get answers?Thank you"
