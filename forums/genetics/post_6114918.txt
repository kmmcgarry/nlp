"I am 18 weeks pregnant with my first child. My husband and I conceived naturally the first time we tried. The anatomy scan at 17 weeks was complete and normal. I just found out from my amnio results that the baby has a balanced translocation of chromosomes 19 and 20. We have not done a microarray to find out if there might be a microdeletion or microaddition. Both of us are healthy, and we will be going in for bloodwork to see if either of us have the translocation. Has this specific translocation ever been documented in the medical field? Are there specific abnormalities that might be associated with this translocation? What is the probability that the child will be normal? If one of us has the translocation, is this cause for reassurance? Thanks you."
