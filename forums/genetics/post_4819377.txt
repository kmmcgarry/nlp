"My boyfriend and I are seriously discussing out future. A child is very important to me as is natural pregnancy. However my boyfriend suffered from a rare kidney disease as a child. He had both of his kidneys removed at the age of six and his mother was able to donate one of her kidneys. I am concerned that he and I will never be able to concieve(conceive)a child naturally if at all. I hate adding this but it is the basis of most of my fears. My boyfriend has an older brother (2 years older) who suffered from the exact same condition. Who also had both kidneys removed and had his father donate a kidney. Both of their parents are strong and healthy people my parents are strong and healthy. I wish I could post the medical name for their particular disease but I cant remember off the top of my head. I can find out tonight but I would love if someone let me know there thoughts.        PEACE& LOVE"
