"my daughter has a duplicate chromosone 17p11,2 but the gentic doctors say that it doesnt mean anything because both myself and wife was tested and my wife has it as well and has never had any problems but my little girl has developmently delays, siezures that are almost uncontrollable, doesnt break down protien proper and is on a very strict diet for that so my main question is does anyone know if lets say u have this duplicate chromosone 17p11,2 and maybe something like if your emzimes stay at a certain level your fine and if they get low or to high thats when the symptoms show i dont know enough bout gentics to understand this please help"
