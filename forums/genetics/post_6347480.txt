"Can you please tell me what this might be?My mother's side of the family has a strange history:-the women get very sick in their thirties, which includes inability to hold their heads up, nausea, weakness, and IBS. My mom tried everything to fix her digestive issues until someone finally suggested that she should take an SSRI, which magically fixed it all. It is not post-partum depression. My mother's mother was bedridden until she died.The men on that side of the family tend to have severe stutters and suffer from alcoholism.I am currently facing a wide range of problems and doctors have not been able to figure out what's going on. I would like to know where to start looking, but I'm just not quite sure."
