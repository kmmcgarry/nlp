"I am wondering, what are some things I should be doing for rehabilitation on my back after an injury?    Is chiropractic care good or can it make things worse?    I just turned 40 and I feel like 60.    I need some insight on what to do and future insight to have a better life ahead of me.    Where do I need to go to get up to par with what to expect or possibly expect?"
