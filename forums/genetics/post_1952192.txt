"I am 24, am experiencing HD symptoms. My family is one of the few in the world who have early onset. I was a Nurse before I got sick. I made a positive, comprehensive website. It has a blog, care giving tips, ways to fight brain fog, myths, my story, my families√¢ Ä ô story, and ways to have a positive testing experience. I also put on there the poems I got published in the horizon.http://heatherdugdale.angelfire.com/"
