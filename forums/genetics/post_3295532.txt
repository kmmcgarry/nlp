"we had a child, who died of Zellweger syndrome. We would like to have another child, and are thinking about sperm donor. Since we have a history of the disorder, what tests would need to be done in order to assure that the sperm donor    is not a carrier. What genetic anaylsis would have to take place and is it even possible???? Thank you!"
