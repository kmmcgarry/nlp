"I went for my level II ultrasound and found out that my baby has an echogenic focus and choroid plexus cysts. I have read that these soft markers increase the chance of down syndrome. Can someone who has had the same type of findings let me know the outcome and health of their baby?My bloodwork gave me chances of 1/10000Ã¢ € ¦.now that the ultrasound found those 2 markers, my chances are 1/5000.I have been so overwhelmed with emotion since the ultrasound. It would really help to know that there is still a chance my baby will be fine.Thank you so very much"
