"Hi,my uE3 levels came back \"extremely low\" (don't have actual values) for the sequential sceen at 16 months pregnant. All other levels were fine, and US did not show any abnormal developments.After consultation with a geneticist I had an amnio done, results still outstanding. The amnio will look for indications of SLO Syndrome as well as x-linked ichthyosis. The geneticist suspects x-linked ichthyosis to cause the low levels, due to a skin condition of mine, as well as my fathers. However, after finding out more about XLI, I do not believe I or my father have XLI, but sebhorreic eczema instead.Now my question is wether:1) the amnio can confirm steroid sulfatase deficiency (linked to XLI) and2) whether there are any other know conditions linked to steroid sulfatase deficiency (such as sebhorreic eczema)I found only one study suggesting this.Thank you for expertise!"
