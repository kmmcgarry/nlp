"My daughter has been recently diagnosed with f5Leiden homozygous.    She had two normal pregnancies and then two miscarriages,    I had 7 normal pregnancies and no miscarriages.    I have had both hips replaced no problems associated with that.    Neither I nor my husband has ever had a blood clot.    Could my daughters test be in error?    It seems that her father and I are very lucky not to have had problems from f5leiden.    What are the odds that someone who is heterozygous would not have any problems from this."
