"Is it also possible to give birth to a healthy over 3kg baby 28 days before your due date with no complications at birth.A woman in her late 30's is accussing my fiance to be the father of her son. He met her 1 day and took her as a friend nothing more as she is a woman nearly the same age as his mother and I truly trust my fiance. I know in my heart he will never hurt me but that's besides the point though. He never again saw her after the one day that they met and about 12-13 days later she called him to say that she's pregnant and the baby is his. He couldn't understand as he never ever was intimate with anyone but me. Her son's now almost 4years old. She even threatened me and our son's life and that the ring on my finger doesn't mean anything to her. He then requested from 2008 till now 2010 for a paternity test which she is refusing. The other day she took him to court for money and he requested through the maintenance officer a paternity test and she was so furious that the court ordered for a test to be done (against her will of course). So I'm so afraid of the outcome. I hope its not his.So that is why I want to know if she might have been pregnant before she even met my fiance and doesn't know who the father is because usually most people find out at about 6 weeks. What do you guys think?"
