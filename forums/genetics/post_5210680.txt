"I am currently 27 years old with a healthy baby girl who is 2.    I found out that I have a hetero mutation of the A1298C gene.     I have always wondered about these genes and autism.    What are my chances of having a child with autism?My cousin, on my mom's side, has 3 sons, 1 of which has autism.    We don't know what her genes look like, if any are mutated, etc.Any help would be appreciated.    I'm sick of getting not so clear answers looking on search engines."
