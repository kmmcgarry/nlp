"I am 21 years old, My father is 5'9'' and mother is 5'1''. I am still 5'4''. I believe my puberty started around 18. I have not seen any height change in a year. I am constantly being told that I look more like a 15-17 year old. My body almost stopped growing when i turn 12 until I was 17, then it started growing little by little. I was 4' 7'' -    4' 9'' for almost 3 years. My grandfather is 5'5'' and my uncle is about 5'8'' (I don't know if its relevant or not.) I also tore my right knee ligament ACL (half torn) last year in May, ever since then I have seen the hold on the height    . I don't know if it has anything to with it or not. I did not go through surgery.So the question is: How long will my puberty last?? and is there any chance that I will grow anymore."
