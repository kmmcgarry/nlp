"First of all I am 16 years, 6 feet tall and weight 118 pounds. For about a year now I have started getting frequent chest pains, palpitations, shortness of breath and sharp pains in my back that started recently. After many trips to th ER and an ecg, chest x-ray, echocardiogram and stress test I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. A few days ago I read about something called marfans and I realized I have most of the characteristics. I have flat feet, I'm very near sighted and have to wear glasses. I'm thin and can't gain weight. My spine sticks out and curves and I have a Sternum that sticks out too. I am going to see my doctor next week but does this sound like marfans? What if he thinks Iam just a hypocondriac and dismissis it without any test. I've heard its rare and that some doctors don't really know about it. Also I have a very low exersise capacity."
