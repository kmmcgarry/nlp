"Hello,Thanks for going through my posting. I live in Irvine, Orange County, CA and would be 35+ at the time of delivery. My first trimester testing came normal and I am considering doing Amnio knowing that first trimester testing is a screening type test. Since amnio has a potential risk of miscarriage which often can be eliminated when the procedure is performed by an experience doctor. Often recommended to find a doctor who does at least 50 procedures per year.I went through a genetic counseling session and the counselor recommended three doctors at St Joseph's Hospital in Orange County with whom the counseling group is attached to. I have no clue on these doctors' expertize and the counselor is not able to provide any statistics on the doctors' expertize or how many amnio procedures do they do. I am desperatively looking for a highly skilled doctor in Orange County or Los Angeles County to perform Amnio procedure for me.Anybody knows about a doctor who does more than 100 Amnio procedures in a year or is know for his/her expertize on Amnio test by his/her peers. Please e-mail me their contact info at my profile name at yahoo.Thanks and looking forward to your help in this matter"
