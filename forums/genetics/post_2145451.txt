"I have Ehlers-Danlos III.    My mother was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my daughter clearly has a case of Ehlers-Danlos III.    So we think my mother (deceased) had    EDS III.    Amongst an array of symptoms that fit into the EDS III category, she had MVP but it wasn't diagnosed until after the birth of her 6th child and was never an issue during pregnancy or childbirth.My question is this, can cardiovascular problems develop as an EDS'r III ages?    Ido understand that in a study between a Cincinnati clinic and the NIH (ODonnell), that approx. 20% of a group of EDS'rs (II & III) were identified to have CV involvement.    But from the literature, I can't find if there is a risk for development of CV involvement as an EDS'r ages, more specifically an EDS III patient.     From my experience with geneticists, I've learned that sometimes there isn't solid science on a matter however there is a suspicion of something common to this group ....but this is only through observation and they relay it as so.Any suspicions or science on CV involvement in the aging EDS groups besides the one with expected CV problems (is that IV?)"
