"My 5 year old son, Zachary,    was born with rather severe swan neck deformities in his index and middle fingers on both hands.    We took him to a hand doctor and were told he might have EDS.    Zachary's elbows hyperextend more than 20 degrees.    His lower extremities do not appear to have abnormal flexibility.    He has developed at a normal rate and is very active.    He plays soccer and appears average or slightly above average in his agility and coordination.    He has never had a dislocation.    He does not bruise easily and heals quickly, however, he had stitches in his upper lip last year and they simply fell out, which I read was common in people with EDS.    He also has weak intrinsic hand muscles and is unable to suspend his body weight on the monkey bars, which the other kids in his class seem to do easily.    I took him to a hand therapist and he wears splints on his fingers.    She said his hands were weak and gave him thera putty to squeeze every day.    She thought it was likely that Zachary has EDS but could not make a referral.    Our pediatrician doesn't seem to know much about it and I don't know where to go (we live in Ohio).    I don't know if I should wait to see if he develops more symptoms or aggressively seek to diagnose or rule out this disorder so I can modify his activities and begin exercises that would promote joint stability??    If he does not have EDS why would he have the swan neck deformitities?     Thank you for your help."
