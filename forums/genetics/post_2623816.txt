"My four-year-old daughter just had surgery for a dislocated lens.    We have had two doctors tell us that they do not think she has Marfans and we have ruled out homocystinurina through a blood test. During the surgery the doctor dilated both eyes and he told us that the other eye has the same dislocation pattern. He asked again if anyone in our family has Marfans.    Neither side of our families has it that we know of.    Could it be an anomaly or do you think she has Mafans?    Is there a genetic test to rule it out? or could it be another congenital defect?    Other than the eyes she is healthy."
