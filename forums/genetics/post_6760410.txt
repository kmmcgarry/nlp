"Newborn born with weak diaphragm that allows kydney and stomach to move up into chest, moving heart to opposite side.    One lung is developed just fine but the other is compromised. Does not warrant surgery at this stage.     Ear tags with left ear deformity and ear canal very small in that ear.    But he passed hearing tests in both ears.    White spot at edge of iris.    Tight heart shaped tongue that will need to be clipped.    Congenital scoliosis.    Could this be goldenhar syndrome?    Are there any other syndromes possible?"
