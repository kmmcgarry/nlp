"Hi :Our little baby girl had been diagnosed with Balanced Translocation after amnio a few weeksago.Now our test results came back and I'm the one who has exactly the same BT(7;13) that she has which may sound good.However;our genetic couns. told us that since it's a maternal BT which involves chromosom 7 ;there is a possibility that she may have RSS(Russel Silver Syndrome).And we've been asked to do UPD7 test to see if she really has it.So far all the U/S that I had did not reveal any of the signs but it might be early since I'm only 21 weeks pregnant.I was wondering if anybody here has similar experience particulary with RSS.Thnx."
