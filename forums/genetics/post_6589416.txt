"Had an ultrasound January 18th. Were having another boy. A few days after the ultrasound my doctor called me. He told me they were fairly concerned and wanted to get another ultrasound of the baby's brain (2 cavities in the brain as well as a cyst). I'm going to a different clinic/hospital. Where I'm going to get to talk to a genetic counselor, do the ultrasound, and finally get to talk to a doctor. This is my second baby. My first baby is 9 months old. I'm 28 and my boyfriend is 31 years old. I've never been through this type situation before. On the genetic side, neither my family or my boyfriend's family has any history of this. I have alot of questions running through my head. What all exactly am I looking at? Like, when it comes to talking to the genetic counselor and if something is wrong with my baby. What exactly causes this to happen? Is it cause my babies are to close at age? Could this be a bad image or glitch in the last ultrasound? I'm just so emotional, nervous, scared, in the state of not understanding, and just really not sure what all I should be expecting. I feel as if I did something wrong in this pregnancy."
