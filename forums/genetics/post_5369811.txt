"Both my mother and her sister (my aunt) have been diagnosed with hereditary spherocytosis in the last several years.    My mom is insisting me and my siblings be tested.    We have no symptoms and are wondering how serious this can be and whether it's something that needs to be checked right away or if we should wait until we notice anything.This discussion is related tospherozytosis."
