"My 8 year old son has been vomiting everyday all day long for over a year now.    We have been to many different specialists.    And he has under gone many tests Reflux testing, Cat Scans, MRI, EEG, Allergy and phsycological testing.    We still have no answers.    Everything says he is health!    But as his mother I know he is not!!!! SOMETHING is wrong!!!!    Is it possible this could be something genetically wrong with him? I seen something called porphyora ( I think) is this possible????????????????? Please Help!!!!!!!"
