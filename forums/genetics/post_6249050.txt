"Hello Ladies...So I get a call from my Doc. to come in and discuss my blood work results. That alone did not sound good. So now I have to see a Genetic Specialist because from what little I remember I think the Doc. inform me that 6out of my 30egss came back with genetic trait 9 meaning that their is a great chance I c...an have children with some type of birth defect or mental retardation. Now my Doc. did let me know not to freak out, that Genetic is not her area, it could be normal or not & once the Genetic Doctor clears it, I can continue on to the next step....... So if anyone has a similar story please let me know"
