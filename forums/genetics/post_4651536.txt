"Hi :)I guess this is a weird question coming from a 15 year old, but is it possible to have a chromosomal disorder but still be completely normal?Like I'm in the IB Program (the one harder than gifted) and I have a 93% average, I play competitive soccer, I run everyday/go to the gym, and (not to be cocky) but guys like me.. so that means I *look* normal?    Yet.. I have a (mild) webbed neck (you have to look closely but my hair is always down), low hairline (no one notices?) and I have epicanthal folds (but I'm asian.. so it looks normal as well).So basically, I have some physical symptoms but I'm smart and I'm normal.. is that possible? Should I get it checked out?Thanks, Jessie :)"
