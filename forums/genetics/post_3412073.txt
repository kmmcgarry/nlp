"My son (14 yr old) has been diagnosed with CFS and ADS. His muscles are very soft and he suffers through periods of extreme fatigue upon exertions. The doctor who diagnosed him seemed to think CFS is the primary cause. He did, however, cite ADS as his primary condition in a letter he provided to the family. I'm curious which condition is the cause of my son's fatigue and what if any genetic relationship there is between the two conditions? Also, and if you know, would use of any medications and/or steriods serve to strengthen his body?"
