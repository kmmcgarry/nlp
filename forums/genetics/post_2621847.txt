After 18 weeks we came to know that the baby is Anencephalic. So Doctor advised us for abortion. Again i conceived in June 2007 and before conceiving as per the advise of doctor we have taken 10mg per day folic acid 1 month before conception. and then went for Alfa Feto Protien Level Test from Ranbaxy after 5 weeks of pregancy. Doctors said that the test is within normal level. After 14 weeks we came to know through ultrasound that the baby is again Anencephalic. So again abortion was done. Doctors adviced us for chromosomal studies. The report shows that there is chromosomal defect in my husband i.e there is inversion of 9th pair of chromosome.
