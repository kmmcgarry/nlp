"I was recently visiting Ukraine and I had a young mother approach me with a question about PKU. Her daughter was diagnosed with PKU at the age of 3, right now she is 11. Unfortunately, doctors were unable to provide family with instructions how to maintain a proper diet, so child was not restricted by any foods. This child is suffering from mental retardation. This family resides in a small village and has very limited financial resources and/or access to medical care. Could anyone please advice this family on how to develop a diet for this young girl.thank you very much for any help or suggestions."
