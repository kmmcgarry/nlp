"Has anyone been diagnosed with mosaic Turner's Syndrome as an adult?    I have only a mild form but this diagnosis has excaped being noticed in my sister.    I'm trying to learn more about it from a personal perspective as I've read a lot about it from research journals.I'd be interested in hearing from other women who have been diagnosed and if there are health issues that I need to keep in mind.Thanks for any responses.-Sarahsmom"
