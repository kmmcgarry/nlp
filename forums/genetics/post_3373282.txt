"Do any of you also have Chiari?Did getting your official diagnosis change life for you?    In what way did it help?I suspect my daughter has EDS (Ehler Danlos Syndrome).    She was diagnosed with joint instability recently by her orthopedic doctor.     He said she was \"floppy\" in her joints.    She also has Chiari, Mild Scoliosis, Central Hypothyroidsism, Vision problems, and Syringomyelia.Do you think she will greatly benefit from us spending the time/money to see if she does indeed have EDS?"
