"Hello everyone i am studying for genetics exam for my univeristy exams, and i just can seem to get the darn inversion/ translocation questions right! here are a few im struggling with! many thanks. alIn corn, three mutations giving rise to short tassle (sht), variegated leaves (vl) and waxy pollen (wx), are recessive and have been shown to be linked on the 6th chromosome. Their respective map positions on this chromosome are: sht: 18mu vl: 29mu wx: 39muAn inversion involving chromosome 6 has been isolated. Its breakpoints are estimated to lie at 26mu and 43mu. Corn plants heterozygous for this inversion, as well as heterozygous for the three mutations, are crossed with a non-inverted line homozygous for the threemutations.Question 8. (3 marks/3 minutes)In cross 1, the expected phenotypes of the offspring will beA. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht,vl; sht,wx; vl,wx; sht; vl; and wx.B. wildtype; sht; vl; wx.C. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht; vl; wx.D. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; vl,wx; sht.E wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht,vl; vl,wx.Question 9. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and vl isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12The following information is relevant for Questions 10 and 11In a second cross, corn heterozygous for the three mutations but now homozygous for the inversion are crossed with the non-inverted line homozygous for the three mutations. Calculate the expected recombination frequencies between the markers in the offspring.Question 10. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and vl isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12Question 11. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and wx isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12AND! another one!In Drosophila two mutant phenotypes vestigial wings (vg) and ebony bodies (e) are autosomal recessive traits. The vg trait is on the second chromosome whereas the e trait is on the third. Males that were homozygous vg-, e- were mated to homozygous wildtype females. The males in this cross were also homozygous for a translocation between the second and third chromosomes. The vg and e loci were included on the translocated sections of the two chromosomes.The F1 males are then back-crossed to homozygous vg, e females.Question 22. 8 marks/8 minutesWhat is the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2?A 1 wild-type : 1 vg : 1 e : 1 vg,eB 1 wild-type : 1 vg, eC 2 wild-type : 1 vg: 1 eD 9 wild-type: 3 vg : 3 e : 1 vg,eE 9 wild-type : 3 vg : 4 eHope you can help"
