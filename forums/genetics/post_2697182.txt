"I am a 29 year old woman, and think I might be suffering from Neurofibromatosis, even though this has never been diagnosed, or even hinted at.I first became aware of the condition because I have several cafe-au-lait birth marks - 3 large ones that are about the size of my thumb, and numerous smaller and lighter ones. Thankfully they are around my torso area, and at the tops of my legs, so are easy to cover up. Anyway, I was searching the Internet for possible options to have these marks removed, and came across the topic of Neurofibromatosis. I was horrified to discover, I seem to fit the bill.As well as the birthmarks, my posture has never been fantastic - more so since my teens, to the point where I'm convinced I have bow-legs - another symptom. I also have failing eyesight, although since everyone in my family needs glasses, this might well be a coincidence.I'm not here for any kind of reassurance - I know only a Doctor could confirm if I had the condition or not. I'd just like to know if the occurance of several cafe-au-lait birthmarks (I probably have around 20) is highly possible without some element of the disease?Thankfully I have none of the external lumps as described the sites, although I do have a small lump on my head which I saw the doctor about when it appeared around 13 years ago. He said it was cartilidge, and nothing to worry about, but I can't help but think this another element to the sum!My Mum doesn't have the condition, but since I've never met my Dad, I wouldn't know about him.When I was a baby, I had extensive testing for Hydrocephalus, due to an enlarged head. What is the likelyhood that anything else would have been tested for then?I hate the idea that I might pass this condition onto future children, and they end up with a far worse case than I do.Any advice much appreciated."
