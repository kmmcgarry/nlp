"I am 38 years old and have had 2 miscarriages in the last 5 months.    My doctor sent me for blood work and the results of my PTT-LA and PTT-LA Mix of the Lupus Anticoagulant reflex came back slightly elevated.    In addition, my MTHFR result showed a single mutation (C677T) identified. What does this mean for me? My doctor wasn't concerned about this. Should I be? I'm interested in a second opinion."
