"In an 18 week ultrasound our technican found our baby has SUA in the umbilical cord.    On our 24 week ultrasound, they identified a very small 1-5mm mass in the apex of the left ventricle (very safe place to be) saying it could be a cardiac rhabdomyoma, fibroma or a EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus.    They had to look 3x over because of it hiding so well and so small.    I am stressed to the gills with this....Because we lost a child in our previous pregnancy (she had 2 cardiac masses in her left ventricle which were on the actual left ventricle wall and septum), they can't ignore the history and are speculating that this may be the initial signs again of cardiac rhabdomyomas leading to Tuber Sclerosis but they have confirmed they cannot factually say this with the information provided.    Both my husband and I were tested for any Tuber Sclerosis mutation and we have none -- it seems it was a new mutation and there is the possibility of something called gonadal mosaicism where other sperms or eggs could have been affected (1-2% chance)...I read some many folks on the internet saying they had SUA and an EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus -- hence my thinking this sounds more like this is what this is.    we had our screening tests and downs etc. were 1 in 20,000, but apparently now reduced to 1 in 300 because of potentially 2 soft markers.    My husband says forgo any amnio and they are not recommending it but do I do it for a piece of mind?What can I do to ease my mind?    What does this sound like?    This will be the longest next 3 months of my life."
