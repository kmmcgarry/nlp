"Hello,I was recently diagnosed, genetically, with LQTS1. My 2 sons, thankfully, tested negative. My question is I am 35 weeks pregnant with a baby girl and her fetal heart rate has always been around 120, which Dr. tells me is normal. However, my niece with LQTS1 who has had episodes such as fainting had a lower heart rate in womb ( 112-125), which triggered the testing for LQTS. Is there any significant evidence of the lower average heart rate in womb to indicate LQTS? Also pediatric cardiologist does not suggest EKG at birth due to irregular EKG in all infants- I feel I should get a baseline EkG at birth.    thanks for your help."
