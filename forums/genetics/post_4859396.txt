"I recently found out that when I was 9 days old I was admitted to the NICU with seizures. After testing I had very low calcium levels that caused the seizures. I was given calcium supplements whicdh seemed to correct the problem except that my baby teet/molars came in with no enamel on them. I also became pigeon toed and seemed to fracture bones from sporty accidents under the age of 10.Is there a possible genetic link here that caused the low calcium in the first place?"
