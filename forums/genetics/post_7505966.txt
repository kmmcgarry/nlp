"I am a 21 year old male. I was diagnosed with \"Marfan Syndrome\" , when i was 18. I always felt i had loose limbs     palpitations, anxiety and a Loose Mitral valve. I was born as a \"Pre-Mature\" child . Is it because of that, i have Marfan's syndrome and defective valve too. Will it get worse with age .i.e will valve get more loose?"
