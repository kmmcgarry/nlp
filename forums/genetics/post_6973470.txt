"Our family has undergone testing for MTHFR mutations, due to multiple children with developmental delays.I am positive MTHFR heterozygous for C677T/negative for A1298C; husband came back negative for both. 2 girls are positive heterzygous A1298C & negative for C677T? We are waiting for other 2 kids results yet. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE OUR GIRLS HAVE A MUTATION FORM NEITHER OF US TEST POSITIVE FOR?"
