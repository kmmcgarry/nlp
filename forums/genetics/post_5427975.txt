"My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years and were slated to marry within the next couple of years. recently he broke up with me as he has been diagnosed with a bad case of eczema which runs in his family. chances of psoriasis have not been ruled out. his great grand-dad, an aunt, and an uncle had these symptoms. we are in great mental trauma as a doctor has advised him against starting a family.can this be passed on to your partner? how risky is it, even if condoms are used? what are the chances of having a healthy kid?"
