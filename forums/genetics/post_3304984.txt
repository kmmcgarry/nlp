"I was born with Congenital Cataracts in both eyes.I passed this condition onto    two of my Children and they passed in on to two of my Grandchildren.There is no Cataracts in my Ancestry..I was told that my mother had Rubella Pregnancy while carring me.An    eye Doctor told me that Cataract from the mother by Rubella would not be passed down to my Children or Grand Children...Is this Doctor Right?TIA..Raymond    (kiwiray33)"
