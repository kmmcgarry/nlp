"Ever since I was little, I've had this bone that sticks out on my chest, like between my boobs, a little bit more to the right, and I got it from my grandma, cuz she has it in the exact same place. I don't know how it got there or why it's there, but it makes me hate my body cuz I can rarely wear tank tops/v-necks/bikinis. Is there anyway that it could somehow move to a different spot so my body looks normal?"
