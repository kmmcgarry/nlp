"My daughter is 10    months old and has been diagnosed with Marfans Syndome along with bronchomalacia. The doctor's think that as she grows bigger and gets older the bronchomalacia may improve. I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on if her bronchomalacia could improve even with her having Marfans?"
