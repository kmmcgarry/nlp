"I am going to my family dr in july and he was gonna run some genetic tests for me do you suggest me hearing all the results or just the results for the problems I'm having?    I am double jointed and have skin that streches and my daughter has the same things going on with her and I also had an abruption with her when I was 32 weeks pregnant she weighed 2lbs and 11ozs 18 years ago."
