"My grand father, my mom, and a cousin all have this. Recently my 18 yr old son asked me about the dip in his chest. It is mild compared to all the rest in the family but it is there. I am wondering if he has it? I know my cousin had to have major surgery and my mom has heart problems now. What are the symptoms of this?"
