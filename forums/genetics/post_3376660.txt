"Does being a carrier for CF make on more susceptible for other diseasesby Loi81Tags: polymorphism M470V, heterozygous 1717 1g-a AsthmaHave been treated for asthma for 7 years. Allergy testing all negative as well as all other diagnostic testing for chronic coughing. Multiple doctors and many medicines, antibiotics, steriods, ct scans, sinus operations, acid reflux treatments, heart tests- echo etc. Condition continually getting worse. Received recent diagnosis of aggrivated asthma which is job related working within the construction industry for close to 40 years. Shortness of breath upon exertion is becoming a major concern. Elevated pressure in right chamber of heart, that my second heart doctor believes in not related to a heart condition. The pressure is not great enough to treat at this time. All testing was negative for everything except Asthma. However, I was found to be a carrier of CF gene, heterozygous1717 1 G-A and polymorphism M470V.    Negative sweat test.Was told that I did not have CF. Resent diagnosis is job related aggrivated asthma. Could there be a correlation between being a CF carrier and a chronic lung, coughing, sputum production, sinus problems, acid reflux etc, conditions that never improve despite all intervention. Or at the very least,    could it be that being a carrier of the CF leads to a greater susceptibility for work relates deseases. Thank you.This discussion is related toCF."
