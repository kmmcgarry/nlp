"I am a 26 year old female, carrying my first child.    I have    had a great pregnancy so far, until i got the call from my mid wife saying some abnormalities have been discovered.    They found a choroid plexius cyst in the brain, and a intra cartiac focus...what DOES this mean???    Will my child have downs?    I just had the triple screen test done last night, and awaiting the results!    I am extremely anxious...can not function!    I have read that the cyst normally goes away.    When I had the ultra sound, i thought i Was 19 weeks, but the tech    told me I was pretty close to 18, and had some trouble getting images of the heart...well, i guess all the images.    Could they be speculatiing of the intra catiac focus?    My husband and I are both 26.    No history in our families of downs, and no miscarriages .    All other pre nateal blood work has been normal, including my last pap...Please tell me I will be OK!!!??    HELP!"
