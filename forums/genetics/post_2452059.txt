"my daughter is almost 3 and has struggled with FTT since birth.    She is 21 pounds and 32 inches, she has a high pitched voice and hypertonic muscles.    she has a very cute face with a broad nasal bridge and wide forhead.    her head circ. is normal.    she had a gross motor delay but with therapy seems to be on track now and also seems to speak pretty well.    she does not seem to be lacking in the intelligence area.    i am just concerned that they have not found an answer for her growth problem.    she also has very 'odd' joints (i.e very large, knocked knees) and seems to move very stifflike.    as a baby she had many respiratory issues but now rarely has any health problems except for the FTT, eczema, chronic constipation and some wheezing with colds."
