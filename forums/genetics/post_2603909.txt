"My girlfriend told me recently that her mother had multiple miscarriages, all of which occurred when she was pregnant with a male child. However, she was able to have two daughters. Is it possible for someone to be unable to give birth to a male, or is it just coincidental? Is it likely my girlfriend will experience the same problem?"
