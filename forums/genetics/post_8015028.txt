"my six year old son has just had his 4 big back teeth come through and four big front teeth come through and our dentist has informed me that the enamel has not formed properly on all of these teeth.    he asked me if my son had been ill as a child which he hadn't and we are now waiting to see if any of the other big teeth that come through are ok or are without enamel.    we were referred to a specialist who has given us preventative methods to take to try to prolong the life of his teeth as they are keen to keep them as long as possible before having to remove them??    anyways a tad worried and not sure what the future holds in terms of dealing with this but wondered if anyone else has encountered the same thing and how or what was done to deal with it??"
