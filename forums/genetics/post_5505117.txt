"I am 40 years old and pregnant. I am scheduled for an Amnio on 4/13 but I'm not sure if I should do it or not. My numbers from my blood work look good according to my Genetic Counselor but I also will be doing a DNA test at the same time. If my numbers are good should I put the baby at risk doing the Amnio just to have DNA done?"
