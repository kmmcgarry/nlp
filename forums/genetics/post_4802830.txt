"My fiance insisted on a paternity test because we were separated for a little bit and I found out I was pregnant. We did the cord blood dna test for the baby. I was put on a bunch of different antibiotics before I was fully dialated. I was wondering if there is anyway that antibiotics could mess with the blood since it was administered through an IV?"
