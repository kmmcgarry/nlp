"Hello,My daughter was just diagnosed today with 10q deletion syndrome. She has low muscle town (hypotonia), and is currently trached for not being able to breathe on her own. She was a preemie - born at 32 weeks. She's currently 7 weeks old.Doctors have nothing to tell us - its their first time dealing with this syndrome. We're at Childrens Hospital.Any or all advice from anyone with 10q deletion syndrome would be great.Thanks!J"
