"My fiancee's mother died of leiomyosarcoma in kidney with subsequent metastasis in liver two years back.His father too died from broncho-pneumonia    when he was young.His father was a chain smoker.Now I am concerned about my fiancee's health .Just want to clarify is there any chance of him inheriting the deadly disease which took his mother's life.I want to add recently he has had jaundice from which he took more than 1 year to recover.we are not sure whether it was only jaundice or hepatitis.I am very much concerned.I will appreciate for any kind of help in this matter.Thanks."
