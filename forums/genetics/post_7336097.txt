"How can one convience their doctor that the aches, pains, chronic fatigue, mental fog, etc. are indeed related to the BTM?    My primary care physican and Neurologist have both diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia; I go to see a Rheumatologist tomorrow.    How in the world do we lead normal lives, reduce the fatigue, brain fog, etc.??    Based on what I am reading, a Hematologist isn't necessarily knowledgeable about the condition and how to treat it.Thanks! MamaK0811This discussion is related toTHALASSEMIA MINOR."
