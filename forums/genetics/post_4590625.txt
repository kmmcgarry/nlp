"My boyfriend is one mark form having Marfan Syndrome, we just found out, after enduring months of intense pain and weakness of the legs etc..., that he has dural ecstasia. It was first diagnosed as a Tarlov Cyst but this turned out not to be the case. He suffers a great deal of pain. What I want to know is, does anyone else have this problem and if so what is your quality of life like? Do you work or do you receive government benefits for being disabled? I know that everyone is different but I would like to know about someone else's experience with this and so would my boyfriend."
