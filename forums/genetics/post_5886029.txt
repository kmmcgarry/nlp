"Obviously Ehlers Danlos can be a catastrophe waiting to happen, however, I experienced a problem that made me ponder how rapidly things can progress.    Imagine yourself walking down the street.    As one leg steps down, the other leg lifts off the ground for a split second leaving your body weight balanced soley on the planted leg.    It was at this point that the leg supporting my weight all of a sudden had zero feeling in it, all the joints of that leg succumbed to gravity causing my 210 lb. frame to collapse to the grounnd.    Upon impact a ligament avulsed from a bone in my foot.    I'm not concerned about the foot, it happens.    I am curious about the complete dysfunction of the leg that caused my rapid descent.    The joints that gave way were the hip, knee, and ankle.    Any postulations would be greatly appreciated.Joel"
