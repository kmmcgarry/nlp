"Im currently suffering from Trigeminal neuralgia but im only 17. My great aunt has Multiple sclerosis and last year my mother suffered from Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis which put her in hospital for about 4 months and she's never fully recovered. Is there a possibility that all these autoimmune disorders could be linked? If so how likely is it that ive got MS with the trigeminal neuralgia as a symptom? Ive been feeling so tired recently and have become very sensitive to heat, I cant help but wonder.."
