"OK, I have NF1 and have lived a pretty \"normal\" life.    Since I have been on this board I have seen A LOT of questions concerning NF1 and the choice to have children. This may seem like a pointless question because I do know that I have a 50% chance of passing this on to a child (if I chose to have one) but it seems as if a lot of people are being told by genetics counselours that it is best NOT to have children...why is that? I've only had 2 surgeries to remove tumors and after that I have no issues with the disease. Again, it is a pointless question but I just want to know why it is reccomended for people who have NF1 to not have children"
