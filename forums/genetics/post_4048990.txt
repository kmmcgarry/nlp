"When my mammogram of 2 years ago showed calcifications, it was suggested (after I had my biopsy) that I should consider undergoing Genetic Counseling... especially, when the radiologist learned of my extensive family history of Cancer. My father has Prostate Cancer; 3 of his 5 siblings have died of various forms of Cancer; his father (my grandfather) died of Colon Cancer. My mother has both Hodgkin's Disease and Lymphoma; 2 of her 6 sisters had Breast Cancer. My sister has had both Ovarian and Kidney Cancer. And, I have 3 cousins on my mother's side who have had Thyroid Cancer. Now, the way I see it, I can't change my genetic make up. I'm 53 and have never had children; nor do I expect to have any. So, can anyone offer me any insights as to how I would benefit from Genetic Counseling?"
