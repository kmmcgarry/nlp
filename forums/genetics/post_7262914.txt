"i was wondering about low ue3, i got my quad screening and it said i was at risk for slos because my uE3 was less than 1 i believe. i had an amnio, still waiting on results. is there anything that could cause this besides itchosis, slos, trisomy or downs. my risk for down's and trisomy were really low. oh yea and my level 2 ultersound showed perfect baby a few days bigger than due date."
