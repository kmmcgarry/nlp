"It's hard to know who to ask these questions of, but I have tested positive for HLA-B27 gene.    The test was done after seeing 3 GP's, 2 hand specialists and a rheumatologist.    Almost 5 months ago I started having symptoms of pain in my right wrist, it progressed to about 1 month later having extreme pain in the night, tingling and numb fingers.    I had some swelling in my wrist up to that point.    I began using ibuprofen and tylenol to relieve the extreme pain which at that point was a 9 during the day and a 10 at nite.    I also iced it and wore a splint.    My fingers began swelling along with my hand and wrist, mostly my pinky and ring finger.    I had an MRI, which showed I had significant inflammation and was sent to the rheumatologist who tested me for HLA-B27, which was positive.    He told me the name of the disease I have is HLA-B27.    I don't understand, because it talks about the gene making you be more susceptible for other things like AS and other spondaloarthopathies, tendonitis, uveitis, etc.    I am on an anti-inflammatory medication, but the I still can't bend my pinky finger because of the swelling.    I was told I have inflammatory arthritis, is that a manifestation of the gene I have tested positive for?This discussion is related toHLA-B27."
