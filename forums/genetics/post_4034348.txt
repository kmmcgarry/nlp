"Hello, i have had high calcium levels for six months. I am soon to be gentically tested for Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH).My question may seem very strange but i after researching i have found nothing and hope someone here may have some answers.My parents took the news very bad and i overheard them saying that `it will all come out now` and that i might `leave them or maybe even hang myself`. They said they must do everything they can to cover this up.I know this sounds very very strange, but i know they were not jokin, they did not know they were there and i really really fear that they are not telling me something.Something that will come up on a genetics test that i do not know about.Any ideas what it could be. There is no dangerous genetic disorders that runs in my family, all of my family on both sides have lived to good ages.I believe it could be something to do with my birth maybe. I am a triplet and my parents were married for ten years before they had children. I believe i may have been born by IVF but i have no evidence on this.Any advice would be gratefull, really cannot get that convosation out of my head.thank youandy"
