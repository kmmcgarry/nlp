"I am wondering how the cell executes the DNA instructions.I am think that the nucleus is the processor and the DNA is the instructions.Almost all DNA codeword's are codewords for a particular amino acid.I am wondering what is the processor of the cell and how does it interperate these instructionsList of all possible codewordsAll of the genetic instructionsAAA    AAT    AAG    AAC    ATA    ATT    ATG    ATC    AGA    AGT    AGG    AGC    ACA    ACT    ACG    ACCTAA    TAT    TAG    TAC    TTA    TTT    TTG    TTC    TGA    TGT    TGG    TGC    TCA    TCT    TCG    TCCGAA    GAT    GAG    GAC    GTA    GTT    GTG    GTC    GGA    GGT    GGG    GGC    GCA    GCT    GCG    GCCCAA    CAT    CAG    CAC    CTA    CTT    CTG    CTC    CGA    CGT    CGG    CGC    CCA    CCT    CCG    CCCSo their are 64 possible opcodes ( in computer terms) is their any bound on how big a DNA strained can be.Like how many letters make a DNA strained up. Or another words is their a bound on the amount of instructions in a DNA strained?I am assuming somewhere in the nucleuos lies on type of processor of these instructions?Does anybody know how this processor works. I.E the speed of interpertation , the structure of the processor ,..etcI know the Chromosomes contain the genes which contains the DNA. I just want to know what process the DNA and how it functions to process these codewords? What powers the processor I am assuming it is a chemical reaction that is repeatitive."
