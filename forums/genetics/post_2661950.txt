"My son's doctor thinks my son might have Prader-Willi.    This was tossed out from left field as we were in the doctor for something totally not related.I asked what it was and she said, I really cant tell you, but my partner thinks its a possibility given my son's short stature and weight.    I said \"short stature\"? He is 4 feet tall and he is only 4 years old.    He also weighs 87lbs.    I    have done some reading about it and there might be some similarities which I always thought were behavior issues that we needed to address, till Prader-Willi was told to me.    My son is scheduled to have testing for this done on April 30.    I was hoping maybe you can shed some light on this subject for me and possibly tell me what I need to be asking the person coming to take the blood, and if they have a counselor what kinds of questions should I be asking them.     I refuse to believe that my son has this disorder till he is tested.    Thanking you kindly in advance."
