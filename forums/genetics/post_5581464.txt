"Hi, I'm Farjana from Bangladesh, It's in South Asia. I'm 34 years old and just have diagnosed as a Thal minor patient. I have no Idea about this disease. My Hb level was decreasing in every three months, iron supplements also didn't work. An electrophoresis done in 2007 and the result was Hb A- 76, Hb E- 20.6, Hb A(2) - 3.4 , ferritin test shows 19.52ng/ml, and then the hematologist said that I'm a normal person. Recently I gave birth to a baby boy , I needed one bag blood during C section as I had Hb- 9.8gm/dl. But still after more than 5 months My hb level is 8.8. So, my gynecologist thinking that I'm a thal patient. Am I really a patient of Thal minor?. My Hb is decreasing in each month. Does a thal minor patient has this kind of symptom? I always feel tired, even if I sleep adequately and take enough rest.This discussion is related toTHALASSEMIA MINOR."
