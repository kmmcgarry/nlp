"I have had surgery for breast cancer and was not able to take either of the aromatase inhibitors (Femara or Arimidex) due to severe adverse reactions.    Through a friend on another discussion board, I learned about a genetic test which may help predict if Tamoxifen therapy will be beneficial to me.    This person referred to it as a \"Tamoxifen resistance test\" due from my reading on PubMed, it appears that it is actually based on the type of metabolizer you are based on certain phenotypes.    My ethnic background is German and Swedish, so Northern/Western European.    I'm wondering if any of you have taken this test?    I am will to pay for it out of my own pocket if it shows that this treatment, with all of its side effects, would basically be worthless in my body.    If you had the test, what was the name of your test procedure and how much did it cost, at which lab?    My doctor has never ordered this on any of her patients and I would be the \"test subject\".    As a former Medical Technologist, this type of testing is very interesting to me and seems like it could save patients a lot of potential problems. - Kay"
