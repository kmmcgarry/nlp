"I have a grand duaghter with low muscle tone age two, not developing skills for her age. Can stand with help has difficulty holding too heave toys ect, makes sounds but does not seem to relate too any person or thing. Does recognise her name and seems happy most of the time. Can get herself up to a sitting position, but seems to get fustrated and not able to return to a lying position. Seems to be senstive to loud noise    Had tests for storage disorders clear.Told probably genetic, not sure what? Tall for her age but parents tall, two brothers healthy.Brain scan normal.Has anyone any idea what this could be?"
