"Ok I'm 14 and recently saw lorenzos oil in science class. About a couple of weeks ago I was easily set off into rampages of anger and since then I've noticed I've been really tired. I am taking exams and I got 5 hours sleep on saturday and 7 hours from the past few nights. As far as I know there has been 0 history on either parents side of AMN symptoms or anything of that nature. I also just feel sick.    Although about 24 years ago my mom had a miscarrage(miscarriage), at least they thought so. but she had had trouble getting pregnant. I am also very tired this week. I dont know if im just thinking I have this or if I could actually have this."
