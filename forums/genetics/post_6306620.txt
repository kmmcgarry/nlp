I am not too happy.But besides that, I was wondering if anyone    knows what the odds are when you have 3 cousins with Ms from the same side of the family...2 first and 1 second cousin. It seems strange that there is 3 in my family. I am still waiting. in limboland. Thanks so much. Have a great day!"
