"Hi,I am a mother of one child who is 7. I am 41, I would love to have one morechild, but can't get off of the Klonopin. I start having anxiety attacks every timethat I try to cut it back very slowly. Is there any way to resolve this? Are thereany tranquilizers that can be taken in a small dose; which could be effectiveand safe to the unborn.Thank you so much,worrierI."
