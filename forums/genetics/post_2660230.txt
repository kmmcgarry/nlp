"I am here looking for support. I had a sequental (sp?) screening done and the 2nd part came back suggesting I have a 1 in 44 chance of having a child with Trisomy 18. Is that high? How accurate are these kinds of blood tests? I am horrified and have been looking up info on it since I found out a couple of hours ago. The Dr. office cannot get me in until Monday, so needless to say I am walking on pins and needles. I don√¢ Ä ôt understand the kind of test this is. I have looked up info online, but some of the readings are confusing to me. For example, one stated this sort of test detects 90% of children with Trisomy 18. Is this true? I am due on Aug. 22, which makes me about 17 weeks. The nurse said I should have an amnio done, but isn√¢ Ä ôt an amnio done about 16 weeks? And, maybe I should have another ultrasound done to look for physcial features? I really need some advice. I cannot stop crying and I just don√¢ Ä ôt understand this. If they didn√¢ Ä ôt have this kind of test, the first part would have been the only test done, which would have came back fine. Now, they do a 2nd part and tell me something might be wrong with my child. What if I have the amnio done and nothing is wrong but it later causes problems with my pregnancy? I have all kinds of situations running through my head and I just don√¢ Ä ôt know what to think. I might add that I have had 2 ultrasounds b/c I see a specialist due to a previous miscarriage. I believe they are level 2 b/c I didn√¢ Ä ôt have to have a full bladder and could see the fetus clearly on 2 different screens in the room. Everything has been okay with development so far, and I am calculating right on schedule with time of conception and growth of fetus only b/c I know when I conceived. I thought this might help you understand my situation better. Please reply with any adivce."
