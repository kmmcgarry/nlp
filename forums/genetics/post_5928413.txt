"I am about to be 30 weeks pregnant with a boy. The doctor found cysts on the baby's kidneys. One on each and are very large. I wasnt expecting to hear this news so I really didnt know what to ask the doctor. The doctor did say when my baby boy is born he will have to have surgery. So my question is...will my baby be ok? Any words of advice right now would be good because im a little scared and stressed out. Thanks!"
