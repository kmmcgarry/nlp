"I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this but my 5 year old has been diagnosed with fructose intolerance and is so intolerant that they stopped the testing half way through and say it is dangerous to do the inheritance testing.    He is starting to exhibit blood, ketones and proteins in his urine.    Could this be connected with his intolerance?    Since the doctors in our area really do not know what to do with him could someone point me in the right direction as to which speciality this falls under.    The immunologists say it is a genetic thing and the genetic guys say its an immune thing."
