"my 3 year old son has been diagnosed with polymicrogyria (no seizures though ) amongst other things like ADHD, SPD, Speech delays, IBS, with even some autistic features. Now we also had a baby that passed at birth from hydracephaley. we were told that it was so rare that it would never happen again. I'm just now finding out these two are linked. My husband has gram mall seizures ( a few every month ) but never been diagnosed epileptic. Is this genetic through him because of his condition ? Also, we have 2 more boys at home ( younger ) what are the odds that there could be something wrong with them as well?"
