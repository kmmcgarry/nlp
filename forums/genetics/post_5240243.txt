"My grandfather had 2 sons from 1 marriage (1 of them was my dad & he had me & my twin sister, we are faternal).He then re-married and had 5 more kids (3 girls, 2 boys) 2 of the girls had twins.My grandfathers brother also had faternal twins as wellI have read on the internet that the women determins if you have twins but looking at my family tree i dont know how that would be the case since my great grandmother had 2 sons 1 of them had a set of twins then my grandfather having 7 kids and 3 of them had twins and 1 of them was his son. Can anyone explain how twins might be running on my side of the family?My great grandmother on my moms also had twins but lost them. Twins arent as common on her side as they are my dads side.My older brother has 1 son and my twin sister had 2 kids but no twinsThis discussion is related toMy Chances of Twins."
