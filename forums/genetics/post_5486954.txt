"Hi if anyone sees me bouncing from one forum to another i hope you will understand. In my small family three of us are battling a war against some kind of disorder/disease that has yet to be identified. in my profile you will see notes about myself my brother and my son. i just can't believe that all that is happening to us is coincidence. i tryly think there is some kind of link. My brother finally received a coupleof answers from his neuro- headaches he is currently experiencing are called \"thunder clap\" headaches and that he has venous cerebular thrombosis. he started the same way i did with fighting hypersensitivity to infections until it finally resulted in cns/neuro effects. My son is the same as am I. I had been diagnosed with ms for 13 years and now they are re-evaluating. Recent changes in my health are excessive profuse sweating that has now changed to oilly thick sweat, foul smelling liquid draining from my ears (ruled out infection) trouble swallowing and nubness in face. this on top of extreme fatique 2 years of chronic pain,    balance probllems etc etc etc. when i first met my neuro he had mentioned adrenoleukodystrophy and then never again (after telling me to watch lorenzos oil    movie.then i plug in my brother's new partial diagnosis :venous cerebral thrombosis guess what one of the causes can be? Adrenaleukodystrophy. I see my neuro on Tues and hopefully we will ALL find out what the heck we are dealing with. i don't know whether to be relieved or scared especially for my son he is only 20 years old.if any of you have this disease and can help me sort through all this i would be eternally grateful!CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE!!!"
