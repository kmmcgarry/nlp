"My 6 year old daughter is being testing for a mitochondrial disorder.    She's had multiple health issues since birth and currently deals with low muscle tone, chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction, autonomic dysregulation, fatigue, poor vision, neuropathy and autistic traits.    She is feeding tube dependent through a GJ tube, and does occasionally eat by mouth.    She is cognitively normal.        When she becomes sick with anything, even a minor cold, all of her symptoms increase ten fold and we usually end up inpatient.    She always has odd basic metabolic labs, such as co2 getting lower even after being well hydrated with IV fluids.    Sugars sometimes drop during illness, especially if we lose the ability to feed her.    She was found to have a deletion in her microarray that is not concretely known to be associated with anything specific, though is often found as an autism loci.    Well amino acid panel and urine organic acids revealed nothing.    So our geneticist requested we do sick labs.    We've had two sets.    First set revealed dycarboxilic aciduria, but blood amino acids were normal.    The most recent set were done with a minor sinus thing and asthma flare but she acted much sicker than basic labs would have suggested.    The blood amino acid panel revealed 12 significant lows and a high plasma lactic acid.    The urine organic acid panel revealed 7 significant highs.    The day she was tested for these, we were sent home she was sick but holding her own and feeds were going at the usual rate.    During that night, her gastric drainage increased dramatically, and we were not able to keep up with her feeds and she was admitted.    Labs that day of admission revealed mildly low blood sugar of 60, low co2, elevated liver enzymes (not hugely elevated though) and a few other off things.    Fluids and gut rest for three days then restarting feeds and she was back to herself though weak.I know that often the blood amino acids are looked for to reveal high levels of amino acids.    I can't find any info on low levels, especially of several lows and how that relates to the high levels.    Both lab reports have been faxed to our geneticist, but it will be a few days before I hear from him I'm sure.    The blood panel reads \"Suggests low protein intake (there is no way it's related to low protein intake as not sick these labs are normal), but multiple lows would suggest that urine organic acid testing be done to further investigate the potential for inborn errors of metabolism\"    and then the urine organic acid talks about dycarboxlic aciduria along with the prescence of other elevated acids could indicate fatty acid oxidation disorders, diets of medium chain triglycerides and ketogenic disorders.\"She doesn't seem to fit the picture of any of those, especially to have gotten to her age without any cognitive issues.    But, I always assumed that with mitochondrial diseases, the levels would be high for both blood and urine.Any ideas how multiple lows play into metabolic issues?"
