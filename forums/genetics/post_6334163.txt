"how can i tell if my son should be referred for tests to see if he has marfan syndrome.    He is 16years old and is 6ft 1inch, he has been having knee pain on and off for years, his fingers are very elongated, he has had to have teeth removed because he does not have enough room in his mouth for all his teeth, has had pains in his chest on and off which my GP has been putting down to infections around the heart. He has eczema and my father died of a heart attack at the age of 46"
