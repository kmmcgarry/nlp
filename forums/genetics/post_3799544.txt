"Okay, i'm 15, 6'1\", and am pretty sure im still growing. However, i think right now this is the perfect height for me. I know that its genetics, cant change your height blah blah blah. But the other day i was out working, and even though the place i was working had unusually small doorways, when i hit my head on one it opened my eyes to what could come if i grow any taller.So i heard that drinking lots of caffeine helps in stunting growth. And doing heavy squats can help keep me where i am. Also, i heard lack of sleep stops growth pretty well. I know this sounds crazy but you dont know how badly i wanna stop growing. So if i do these things will it aid in my stunt of growth?Thanks"
