"i have two little girls who are totally healthy. then, i had a miscarriage at 11 weeks. took me two years for some reason after i had a D&C done with that pregnancy to get pregnant again. finally did and everything was going along so smoothly! we had a ultrasound done and found out through that and amnio that we are having a trisomy 13 baby! this was a total shock. and, is a shock still everyday. i am now 32 weeks along and the doc thinks that the baby has a 70% chance of being born alive. i am so scared to go through labor with this in my mind knowing that the outcome will not be a good one at the end. i am scared of looking at my baby and seeing him pass or struggle. he has a translocation of the 13th and 14th chro and docs wanted to do genetic testing on me and my husband but we have said no because we have two little ones now that are totally fine so we know that it does work for us. i asked the genetic counselor what the chances in this happening again was if let's say i carried a balanced translocation of the 13th and 14th chro she said it would still be 1% chance of it happening again. we so wanted a little boy too! i just want to know if anyone else has had this happen and if they were able to find the courage to try again and had a healthy baby?"
