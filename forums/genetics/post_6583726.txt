"Hello!I have quite a few issues and I can't help but think they must be related.    Is there any genetic issues or diagnosis that might tie everything together?    I am worried that I might have passed it onto my daughters.I have a Chiari MalformationScoliosisPineal CystChronic PainReverse lordosis of the cervical spineI also have a bone deformity where my arms do not straightenHypermobilityEthmoid sinus diseaseAsthmaHeadachesChronic throat infectionsAny ideas on something that might explain why multiple parts of my spine are formed incorrectly - two issues with the formation of my brain, along with issues with my joints, that also causes intense pain.... I see a neurologist and a pain specialist but who could diagnosis this or at least pull these symptoms together?Thank You"
