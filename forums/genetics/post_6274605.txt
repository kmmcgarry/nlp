"My daughter and I went to NIH. Our DNA report stated that My kid was positive for P453S and I2g mutations on the CYP21 gene.    I did have all the deleted genes related to 21 hydroxlase deficiency, But Gabs has a \"larger gene deletion\".    They also took pictures of how flexible we are. Tenascin X deficiency associated woth a mild Ehrles Danlos recessive disorder might be probable. Can anyone help me figure out what this means. My kid feels weak all the time, has Pseudotumor cerebri, please anyone?"
