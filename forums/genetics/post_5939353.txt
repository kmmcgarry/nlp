"I just had an ultrasound completed at 21 weeks pregnant. I am 27 years old and have a healthy 15 month old baby boy. After the ultrasound, the Dr. came and talked to us and said the the right kidney of our baby girl was slightly dilated. He did not seem to be too concerned with it, but i have been reading a lot of things that connect this to Down Syndrome. He said everything else looked perfectly normal but I still worry! Does anyone have experience in this???"
