"I would like to know how much long life in one or both parents can effect a child.    My father died at 70,but my mother is still going strong at 93.    If that is so much a factor how can people improve their longevity by exercising if the genes in the family say no.    I worry about my girlfriend whose mother died at 77 and father at 49.    Her grandmother died at 83.    Thanks, Maurice"
