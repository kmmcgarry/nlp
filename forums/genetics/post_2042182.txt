"I have a Negative Rh factor and my husband is positive. I believe my daughter is negative. What are the chances that our other children will be negative? ( A-, O+ and daughter is I think O-?)Off the topic a bit but anyone know anything about reoccurring leg pains, thought it might be hereditary or something. Thought it was due to lack of Calcium too but doesn't see that way any more I take 3 600mg tablets a day some times a little less maybe one more every now and then.thanks in    advance."
