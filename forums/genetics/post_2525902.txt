"HiI am particularly interested in the study of human genetics and have got this question: Is there X-inactivation in Turner's Syndrome (X0)? I looked up some sources and they claim there is, and in addition, it is a NON-random inactivation? What does this mean? Does it mean the only X left is being inactivated, thereby causing the girl to have literally no X? And for its inactivation, do the same rules of \"escape from X-inactivation apply?\" (For e.g, pseudoautosomal regions are left intact)I'll really appreciate it if someone can answer my questions. Thanks so much!"
