"I have had constant discomfort and pain in my right toe and part of my foot. I know it isnt gout. I went to the Rhematologist today but he talked in a language I didnt understand and I left there confused. He said I, as my Brother who is a patient of his has, B27 Gene. But he also was talking about my spine. He said my pain in my toes was athis big name that I think equated to inflamation(inflammation)in the joints and the tendons that attach them.. Does this make sense?"
