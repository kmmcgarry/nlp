"I√¢ Ä ôm eighteen years of age, male, light tan colored skin (Caucasian), green eyes, average height, super white hair (since birth), body builder, and relatively healthy. Doctors never really tested me except a test that confirmed I didn√¢ Ä ôt have Albino. Doctors didn√¢ Ä ôt see the need through my youth years to do anymore testing because I seemed relatively healthy. Though, I√¢ Ä ôm concerned there might be something wrong with me genetically and they just haven√¢ Ä ôt made any real effort to find out. They pretty much figure to wait and see what√¢ Ä ôs going to happen before doing anything. Also, depression and suicidal thoughts are beginning to set in because I don√¢ Ä ôt seem to blend with the crowd and people love to stare. I√¢ Ä ôm normal (I Think) everywhere else on my body except my hair. Dying my hair is like impossible. Does anyone have any guesses why my hair is white (not blond)? Should I be concerned over my health? Doctors know it's genetic, but haven't bothered to find out what's causing it. I've always notion I had some type of rare DNA. I'm considering seeing another doctor now that I'm eighteen."
