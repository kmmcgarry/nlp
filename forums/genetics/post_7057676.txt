"After a recent test of labwork to find some answers due to my missing periods, my doctor calls to tell me that in addition to high prolactin level that may be caused by a tumor on my pituitary gland, that my adrogen level is high, caused by Nonclassic Congential Adrenal Hyperplasia caused by a 17 hydroxyline defiency - late onset.She told me that this is now tested for at birth, but back when i was born (1987) they probably didnt. She says that i don't show signs of salt wasting (though she has had me on a high sodium diet since college, after I passed out out sign of class, falling on my face). There is very little info out there, especcially on the 17 subtype of CAH, and not only that, I have had periods throughout my life, though they have never been normal (many months inbetween), nor do i appear to have any of the virliizing signs of excess androgens.My doctor told me on the phone that she doesn't know much about it, hense her sending me to a specialist in endocrinology.i am of course wondering what this is going to mean for my health, but also the possibility of having children in the future, and if it is even possibly. Any comments about knowing anything about this would be helpful...i dont see the endocrinologist for a month."
