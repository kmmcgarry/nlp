"Hi, I am a 24yo male, 6ft and 12st5lb. I am concerned that I may have Marfan disease and that my mother does as well. Below are the reasons for my concern. My doctor has said he is not concerned that this is marfan's as I am not tall enough and don't have enough features.My features arelong limbs and spidery fingersarm span 1.025 that of heightUS:LS ratio 0.86high arched palate with slight crowdingstretch marks after pubertyhave hypermobility in knee and thumb jointspositive wrist sign but not thumb signearly puberty and reached maximum height at 14, I was also always a head taller than class mates through school until the later yearsTMJ problems ie pain and clickingmultiple clicking and popping jointsclawed 2nd toesMy mother shares the same features and has suffered from frozen shoulder.I must add that my vision is near perfect with the exception of a few floaters, as is my mothers.I had an echocardiogram to check the chambers and valves a while back due to strange heart beats which turned out to be PVCs, the echo was fine but would the aortic root have been imaged on a standard echo of chambers and valves?Really I am just looking for validation of my doctors claims that it is unlikely I have marfans based on my symptoms and family history which I must add has never had anyone die of heart disease?Thanks"
