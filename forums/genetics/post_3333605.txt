"My sister married our second cousin my mothers first cousin.My sister has more genes on my mothers side and is the spitting image of my mothers side of the family.My major concern is they had a son who is now 5 lovely lad no problems second son died before he was born bang on 40 weeks so she had to give birth to him third child struggles to keep weight on and they have just had a forth child who has been rushed to another hospital because he has heart and kidney defects.My sister needs all the suport she can get at the momment and i love her dearly but have always thought it would be tough for them because they are related.Is this defect a direct result from them being related???????"
