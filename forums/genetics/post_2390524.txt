"Hi.    I just got the test results back from my fetus.    I miscarried for the 2nd and possibly 3rd time.    It shows trisomy 16.    Anyone out there have any stories about having a healthy baby after this?     My husband and I will get blood test done this Friday and begin Genetic Counseling in the next few weeks.    If anyone has any information about your chances of having a healthy baby or if it is not a possibility I would love to hear from you.    I am 33 and my husband is 39.    Amy"
