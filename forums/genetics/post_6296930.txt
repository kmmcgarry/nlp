"My Half Sister is a caucasian woman of German Ancestry, for years her Doctors tried treating her for severe Anemia, they nearly killed her.    She was kind of astranged from her father's family, but descovered that almost every member of her father's family had thalassemia, but when she told her Doctor's they where in disbelief.Once the test came back positive they were shocked.     Since I have seen some other cases of such mentioned, in articles.    However Everytime she go's to a Doctor, she has to go through explaining, and they wind up retesting her constantly, always with the same results.    Why is there such a misconseption amoung Doctor's, I even seen a Doctor on CNN, SAY \" Thalassemia is only in People of Asian, Mediterainean, and African decent\"    We now know this is incorrect.    Because her father's Family is true German, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, PALE SKIN.Why are Doctor's not being educated as to the possibility of this.    Both her daughters tested positive, one with the disease,the other as a carrier, this Daughter also has Lupus.    We would like to know what treatments are best, as well as Dietary suggestions, for managing this as well as Iron Overload"
