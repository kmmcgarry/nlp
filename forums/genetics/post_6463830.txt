"I am a carrier of fragile x that I passed down to my daughter, she in return passed to my grandson. My daughter and I show no signs of this disorder but my grandson has been diagnosed with moderate    fragilex. My question is as I get older will I have or show symptomsof this or other problems associated with a carrier? Thanks in advance."
