"I went for my level 2 sonogram a week and a half ago.    A week later I went to my ob's office and we discussed the resutls (I though everything was ok, because the radiologist - dr not tech- said everything looked great) and was confused and shocked.    She said that the report a mild dilation of the right cerebral ventricle.    Huh?    I was so surprised I forgot to ask questions.    She said since my genetic testing came back normal that she was not too worried, but I have to go see a hgh risk perinatologist to get another sono.So my question is what is this a marker for.    When I asked my ob she kind of danced around it.    I am not even sure if I should be concerned.    I did some research on line and the interent is pretty scary.    Any info would be great cuz I am freaking out.Thank you so much!"
