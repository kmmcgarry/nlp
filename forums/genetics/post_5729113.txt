"I went for my 20 week ultrasound at 20w 4d.    I was told that the baby's nuchal fold was 5.3 mm which my doctor said was thick.I had the NT scan at 12w 4d along with the blood work and the scan was within the normal range and the blood work came back fine.I was also told that the tech couldn't see the aortic arch.My question is why would the first tests be normal and now 8 weeks later be abnormal?Also could the aortic arch and nuchal fold issues be related?"
