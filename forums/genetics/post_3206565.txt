"after having 2 miscarriages, my dr. had some labs drawn. the labs came back that i have 2 copies of the a1298c mutation. It is my understanding that that during pregnancy i need to take a baby asprin, folic acid, and lovenox injections. I don't really understand this mutation or what it even is. are there treatments that i need to be on when i'm not pregnant? could you please explain this mutation and the treatments during pregnancy and treatments other than during pregnancy?"
