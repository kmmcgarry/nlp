"My friend tells me today that he has Balanced Chromosomal Translocation. Of course I immediately look it up. I'm scared because it says it can cause all of these different types of cancers.He tells me that it happened on his first chromosomes, and that all of them are mixed up.Is that even possible? What does this mean... What's going to happen to him? Help!!I want to know as much about this as possible, even he doesn't know.This discussion is related tobalanced chromosome translocation."
