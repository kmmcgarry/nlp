"I'm married to my double first cousin. We also have related marriages going up the family tree upto our great great grandparents.I wish to know how much the risk of genetic deformities/disabilities is increased by. Also is there an increased risk of miscarriages?Obviously before having children, this information is vital. Then I can decide whether separation is best or not?Thankyou"
