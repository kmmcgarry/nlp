"Hi all,Kindly help me out with this question.Turners syndrome in females occurs due to the absence of one X-chromosome. And we know that in every woman, there is only one active X-chromosome, due to the lyonization process in which one X-chromosome is inactivated. Then why don't all women have turners syndrome, if either ways one X-chromosome does not function (is absent of inactive)?"
