"I had a supervisor with Asperger's Syndrome and she was the most difficult person I have ever worked with. She never spoke to me unless she was degrading me. She told the reason she was mean was becuase she has asperger's syndrome. I wonder if she should have a been put in position of authority if she is so anti-social."
