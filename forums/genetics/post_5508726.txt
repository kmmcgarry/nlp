"I have a kindergarten student that was labeled as having autism while attending a developmental preschool.    He has also been diagnosed as having deletions of chromosome 10 and 22.    The parent indicated that the geneticist has called it \"catch 22.\"    He has done well academically until recently when he had a medication change.    The student was taking concerta to lessen his hyperactivity and impulsiveness.    The parent was concerned because she thought he was developing 'tics.'    These were not seen at school.    He was put on an anti'psychotic and seemed to have no self-control at all and had to be removed from the classroom. ** I would like to know if there are other children with these concerns and medical issues and the best treatment plan to use.    Thanks for your help!"
