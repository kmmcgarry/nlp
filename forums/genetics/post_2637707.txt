"i wanted to ask that are deaf and dumb problems genetic. because i want to marry a gal whose mom is deaf and dumb.. and she is deaf and dumb and is in the third generation. and her gal whom i wanna marry will be in fourth generation. the girls maternal uncle and grandfather also had the same problem of being deaf and dumb. so would this problem harm or continue in the next generation. i mean our children can also face the deaf and dumb problem."
