"Hi there, I was just wondering about my son.    My husband and I were both just asked to have chromosonal testing done as our son (our second child together, my third child) was diagnosed with 4 and 10 balanced translocation as he was genetically tested in the NICU as he was 6 weeks premature and had respiratory issues.    I am just learning of this and we dont know yet if my husband and or I carry this as well, so far at 8 months old he is meeting al his milestones, and our daughter who is 22 months is also on tract, although very petite (22lbs).    I have read in some forums that this can cause predisposition for certain cancers, mental retardation and schizophrenia and or problems for his ability to have children in the future as well :( We also wanted to have another child when our son was 2, should we not risk it if this might happen again, he is 31 and so am I, we will be 32 when we try to concieve(conceive)again, if we choose..any information you can give me is well appreciated!"
