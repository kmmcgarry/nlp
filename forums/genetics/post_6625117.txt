"Hi to everyone, A little back ground, I was a foster Mom to a 10 month old little boy who has CF, when he became freed for adoption we gladly made him our forever son. He just turned 10 years old, He was just pick to have a wish gratted by the make a wish foundation. I am over joyed and humbled by this.My problem is that even though I have known all along he has CF,this has made me feel I don't know like I just found out about he CF, like it just hit home that my son has something that can kill him. This sounds really crazy to me because I have always known, and I am just worrying myself sick about it. I mean it is all I think about. does this sound crazy to the rest of you or does anyone have some insight as to worry i would feel this way, thanks Julia"
