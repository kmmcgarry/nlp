"Okay. So I honestly do not know where to put this, but I figured since it sort-of runs in the family that I would give \"Genetics\" a shot.Basically I have short, thick legs. I'm about 109 lbs, 5' tall, exercise at least 30 min every day and have an average diet (all I drink is water or juice, never soda; not big on fast food, eat whole wheat... etc.). I've always had a hard time loosing weight, though, and I could eat virtually nothing and still have tummy issues.Anyway, I have short, thick legs, and lately it's been bothering me. Is it possible that because I'm carrying more weight on my upper body that it's hurting my legs? I say genetics because my mother has the same issue, as did her mother, and my brother is really tall and thin.If no answer, a suggestion on where this question should be placed?"
