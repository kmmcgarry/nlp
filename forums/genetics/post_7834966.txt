"I am 22, female ad just had my first baby a year ago. I have ehlers danlos syndrome, pots, an asd, polycystic ovary, peripheral neuropathy, hyperreflexive reflexes, anxiety, dizziness/vertigo/lightheadedness, endometriosis and a mitral valve prolapse. I has been treated for all of these I have been having exact symptoms of Arnold chiari malformation and ms. All the way up to muscle spasms, increase tachycardia, memory loss, weakness, muscle/weight loss and much more. I have been tested or stress and dep. But have neither. I am a very optimistic person and I am pre med so being diagnosed young with things has helped me learn knowledge is best to overcome fear. Anyways, I had an MRI of my brain (lying down) and found nothing as I know of (neurologist told me over phone my EEG and bloodwork was good and my MRI was pretty normal). I meet with her Thursday. She has been pretty rude to me and I'm sure because I am young, but I have been in so much pain from my body and persistent head pressure following with migraines, that I've actually resulted to taking my left over pain killers from post labor. I HATE medications and pk's make me feel sick but it's worth it to get rid of the pain. They said no sign of ms or acm from brAin MRI and the neurosurgeon my pcp talked to said a standing isn't necessary. I don't know what else do do or expect. These symptoms are very real and very debilitating and with my son being 13 months and husband going into training for marines soon, for my sons safety I need to take anoter approach to help myself and pcp try to figure out what possible culprits there could be.Thank you!J"
