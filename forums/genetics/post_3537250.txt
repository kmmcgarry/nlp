"I have cirosis of the liver, I have never drunk alcohol and the doctors are not comming up with any cause of my cirosis.The closest I have come up with a cause is my hobby of making stain glass lamps and the fumes from the flux and lead soldering fumes.    I stopped the hobby about 10 years ago but my liver is still a problem.I have esophical varicies, hypertension, enlarged spleen, and acitities.What do you think my problem is?    Is it hemochromatosis?    Any suggestions for me to give my gastroentogist?This discussion is related toHemochromatosis."
