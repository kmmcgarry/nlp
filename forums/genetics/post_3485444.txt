"Ive written before about my health and how I am really concerned. My family always laughs at me saying Im being a hypochondriac but I know my body and I know its not well. What my concern is that my family has a history of Cancer and cysts. My mother whom I just met only a few years ago told me recently that her maternal grandmother had Breast cancer which resulted in a double mysectomy at the age of 50. My mother had a removal of a benign breast tumor, multipul ovarian cysts, removal of right ovary due to ovarian varicocele (which by the way, was not found until time of surgery to remove a large cyst ), and Endometrial cells now present for 5 mos. with cramping and pelvic pain. D&C, hystoscopy and X-lap scheduled. She also has MS if im not mistaken and liver cancer. Now I have been having some similar problems. Im very cystic and recently have a mass size of 5 maybe 6cm. Ive come very close to having Cervical cancer from Dysplasia thankfully it was cought and had a LEEP. Im in pain most of the time, sex hurts, i tend to bleed after, my ovary area feels like a stress ball being sqeezed, Im bloated all the time, i have a pressure on my bum when i sit, my cycle is wacky, hurts to walk or sit. Now I am really sore on the side of mt right breast. All these things have recently come up. Ive never had these types of symptoms before other than the ovarian cyst pain. Ive called my PCM and had several appointments with \"them\" and have told them my concerns. Now I know that just because my mom has all these things and my grandmother had cancer too that I am not nessesarily next in line. I justam out of ideas how to express my concern and get some real action from them. I even called to ask for a CA125 test done and i was almost laughed at and was told \"no, we dont do that. Until its a concern. You will have to go see an off base doc and pay out of pocket. Ugh, thats what im dealing with!"
