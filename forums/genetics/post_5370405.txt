"I have found recent research of Italian subjects linking a MTHFR mutation to NTDs (Neural Tube Defects) of which Arnold-Chiari Malformation is either a member or a very close cousin. Additionally, I have found different research that indicates that the same MTHFR mutation can manifest as Aspergers (or high-functioning autism).I have 2 children ... one was born with a hairy sacral patch and a sacral dimple (suspected of spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome, neither confirmed, but plenty of opposing doc opinions) and later we found the Arnold-Chiari Malformation. My older child has Asperger-like behaviors (Autism Spectrum Disorder), OCD, and Sensory Processing Dysfunction.I am curious if there has been a study of siblings to determine if MTHFR could be the missing link in causing this sort of \"coincidence\".Also, MTHFR mutations can cause pre-eclampsia in pregnancies. I was borderline pre-eclampsia for my first child.Thanks in advance for you reply,MargaretThis discussion is related tomthfr gene."
