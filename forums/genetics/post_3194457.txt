"Hi , I haven't been able to receive a clear understanding of what it really means nor the risks    [if any] associated with having both a heterozygote prothrombin gene mutation and also being compound heterozygous for 2 gene mutations of MTHFR.I was on heparin for last pregnancy following DVT episode with previous delivery and years later had repeat DVT's following simple [and short] gyno surgery. Only thing I have been advised to do since is have clexane injections on flights longer than 4 hours. Nothing else on daily basis. Please advise if you feel this is accurate.Kind Regards,Mia"
