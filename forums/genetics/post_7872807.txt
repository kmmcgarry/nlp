"I've been with IBS problem for years and never seemed to find the perfect recepe to stop this uncomfortable situation. This effects me daily and especiallyin the morning. I really don't know what to do because I reallycan'tgo anywhere. Fishing, walking, gogging, shopping and not even to my 5 minute walk garage. I'm dippressed. Can anyone help or know someone who can help me or give me an advise because plenty of doctors said there's no cure for this problem."
