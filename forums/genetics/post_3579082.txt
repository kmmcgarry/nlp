"I am currently 40.    I worked full-time and went to school full-time for 10 years.    I have my BA, MS and JD.     I want to be better!!     When I was 20, I had grapefruit sized cysts that wrapped around my tube and ovaries and had to undergo a major surgery to correct this.     Then when I was 26, I started getting a lot of pain in my arms and limbs and was dxed with polyarthalgia.     I have DJD since 29 in my spinal and neck along with a couple of herniations..    In 2001, when I was 32, I went through my first breast cancer scare in my left breast - there were numerous diagnoses for this including, atypia with hyperplasia, papillomas, fibroadeomas, the list goes on and on and had a lumpectomy.        Now in 2008, I have a tumor in my right breast.    I underwent a biopsy last week and am awaiting the results.    I also get cysts on both the left and right of my head behind the ears at least I think that is what they are!.     Is there some kind of recommended genetic testing that you recommend?        I also have a congential hemangioma in my thoracic spine (it does not bother me, but wonder if this is relevant).     Many of my relatives have died of cancer - breast, adrenal, lung, metastatic, GI, stomach, many of them young as well.        I am not sure what to do here, but I simply want to get better.        Sorry to be so long, but any help would be most welcome.        Thank you very much for your kind assistance."
