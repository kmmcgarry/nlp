"Hi,I had a miscarriage in Apr. 08. MyOB sent me to the lab to get a series of blood test and I tested postive for two copies of the C677T mutation and I don't have the A1298C mutation. I haven't been able to find anything online that I can understand about have 2 copies of this mutation. I have a healthy 15 month old daughter so I was caught off guard by finding out that I have this. How will this affect her and should I get her tested for anything ?Thank you"
