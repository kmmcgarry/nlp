"I have been diagnosed with heterozygous MTHFR and Factor XII with platelet function. I am on 8mg of coumadin a day and folnate. I have some concerns. I know my homocystien level was very high and my doctor hasn't checked it since I have been on my medication. Should my homocystien level be checked? The last time it was checked was during the initial diagnosis in Feb. of this year. I am also getting acute UTI's and have had pneumonia twice since then. What questions should I be asking my doctor and should he be showing more concerns about my infections and pneumonia?"
