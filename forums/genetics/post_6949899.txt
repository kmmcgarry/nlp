"I searched the whole internet and I could not find something like that. The problem is that my both shoulder clavicles are bumped out. I am a man,18 years old, I am a slim body from genetics but Ive been working out a lot so my body is a bit ripped, I have no pains and no traumatic events and no fracture. The bad thing is that my shoulder bones are still bumped out whether I was 15 years old or now 18 years old. What should I do about that? should I take a surgery?PLEASE HELPBoth of my shoulders looks pretty much like thathttp://www.shouldersurgeon.com/ac_joint/ (see figure 3)"
