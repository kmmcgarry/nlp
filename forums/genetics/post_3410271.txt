"Hi, I was wondering if anyone has any knowledge or experience with FAP(Familial Adenomatous Polyposis) and having children. My boyfriend was recently diagnosed with this genetic disorder, which causes colon cancer, and he has a 50% chance of passing it on to children. There is the option of IVF, but being that there's nothing wrong with me I'd prefer not to have to take all those drugs. I was wondering if anyone knew of other options, maybe some sort of sperm screening? I'd appreciate any advice or even references to others who might be able to help. Thanks"
