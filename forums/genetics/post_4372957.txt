"Alright, so I know for sure that I have a German, Irish, and English background. I have squinty eyes whenever I smile, and smaller eyes than other guys I know, which has lead people to believe I'm Asian. Not that being part-Asian is bad or anything I just want to know if there is another European gene trait that would cause me to have smaller eyes, or if I have some Asian blood.Useful information: My mother came from a farming family in North Dakota, and as far as I know is 100% German. My came from a logger/mill family up by the Canadian border(that's where the Irish/English came in). I have 20/20 vision, and have no other traits commonly related to Asian genetic tree. (blonde/brown hair, white skin etc.)This is just a want to know question, thanks in advanced for you help."
