"Hi, I am 10 weeks pregnant and my partner and I took LSD and mdma about a month before my last period before getting pregnant (before I was pregnant). I didn't know I was pregnant until I was three weeks pregnant and during that time I smoked some home grown weed someone gave me (about three times - not much just a few drags and not with tobacco). Also I was taking a low dose (15mg) of amitriptyline for about two to three weeks into the pregnancy. I am worrying constantly, more so about the Class A's we took during the holiday before the conception. Have we done any damage to the unborn child? I was taking solgar multivitamins throughout the period and eating really well and I don't drink alcohol ever. I am 35 years and taking vitamins and eating well and am having an easy pregnancy so far with just some queasiness if I get hungry. I just can't stop worrying,"
