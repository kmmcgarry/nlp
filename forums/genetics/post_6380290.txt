"hi im 21 an have been diagnosed with ADHD since i was 4 yrs old . I have had problems staying on task ,paying attention , sitting still .. when i am in deep conversation an some one interrupts me i forget what i was just talking about ,as well as if were talking an hear some one speaking loudly i will automatically turn an look an forget what i was saying .. its like my mind goes blank.. i have had this for a very long time ! quit taking my meds when i was 17 now that i have a child it seems to b worse ? Ive had jobs an i work hard but cant seem to keep up with my learning ability's to keep on task an forget very quickly .. i seem to think i need my meds back ??? is this a logical reason to take them ? thank u"
