"My family has a huge history of Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome which afflicts many family members, can cause tumors in the eyes, ears, pancreas, kidney, brain and spine. Roughly three-fourths of the affected family members have pheochromocytomas Ã¢ € ” tumors of the adrenal gland. It seems that I may have it as well.... does anyone know where I go, who I see and what I do to find out if I have it?Thanks,Kineks"
