"HiI am hoping to find some answers because the report that we have just recieved from the geneticist is not clear.    My daughter is 10, and has had developmental problems since birth (she is adopted but we know her medical history).    She has been diagnosed with autism and has moderate learning disabilites, however both her pediatrician and geneticist felt that due to her dysmorphic features she had some kind of a genetic condition.    Her results are as follows:Chromosome 5 Gain of 18.69kb arr 5q35.2(175,511,640 - 175,530,330)x3Chromosome 8 Gain of 99.46kb arr 8p23.3(16,970 - 116,430)x3Chromosome 14 Gain of 502.03kb arr 14q.11.1q11.2(18,857,900 - 19,359,930)x3Chromosome 18 Loss of 135.83kb arr 18p11.32(1,900,540 - 2,036,369)x1Chromosome 10 loss of 4.08kb arr 10p12.1(25,304,960 - 25,309,040)x1This was all the information we have been given, but can't decipher what exactly is going on with her.    We feel that she must have some sort of syndrome as her MRI and EEG both showed normal brain function and structure.    Can anyone decipher these numbers and tell me in real terms what they mean?Thank you in advance!"
