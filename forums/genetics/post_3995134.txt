"Hi my name is Bethany. Two months ago I gave birth to a baby boy but unfortunately he died after nitheen hours because of bilateral renal cystic dysplasia kidneys.When I was pregnant with my son almost the first three months and even two months before I got pregnant I used to work in contact with chemicals melamine which the same melamine contains formaldehyde. Do you think that this played a role to my son's death and is bilateral renal cystic dysplasia kidneys genetical in other words if I try for another baby could this happen again?"
