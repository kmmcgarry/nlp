"I've had this big lump/bump on my head for a few years from what i can remember, i'm not sure if i had it when i was younger, i never really examined my head lol but it seems like this lump is getting bigger and now the past year or two i've noticed another 2 smaller lumps on my head. They are located near the front of my head but to the side. I'm really worried as to what this may be. It has never been painful, and i don't get sick often or suffer from headaches or anything, that's why i have never bothered to get it checked out. it feels hard like bone but spongey and squidgy on the outside. My mum tells me that my grandmother has them on her head too. I would really appreciate it if anyone experiencing the same thing or anyone who knows what it may be could give me some more info. Thanks."
