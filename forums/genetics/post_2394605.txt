"My step daughter has mild mental retardation with Autistic tendencies.    Her mom has another child with no disabilities.    Her dad and I are planning on having a child.    Is there a chance our child will have disabilities.    My husband is afraid it is his genes since his ex wife has another child that is \"normal\"."
