"I read Gordon Allport.It is in Everyman's genetic interest to get many women pregnant.    Lacking that, if other men who look like Everyman, and therefore must share some of his genes, get women pregnant, this can't be too bad, because at least some of Everyman's genes must be still in the game.But if a man looks nothing like Everyman, this is bad, because now Everyman believes that the likelihood of his genes being passed on must be close to zero.Yes?"
