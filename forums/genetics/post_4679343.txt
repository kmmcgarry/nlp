"Hello,    I have a bumchin... or dimple, or whatever you want to call it.    I was just wondering what are the chances that my children will have a bumchin?    I believe that a bumchin is a recessive trait... that is a dominant gene will take over, but i really don't know for sure.    Just wondering if it is indeed a recessive trait or a dominant trait."
