"Hello! I'm writing from Estonia. My aunts husband has some kind of genetic disease. His parents are normal, but he and his sister are both sick. He also has a daughter with the same disease. I also added a picture of him. The symptoms of this diseas are: short legs and stocky torso and ankles have a small absence of motion. The daugter is also quite heavy if to consider that she is only a child. And it is difficult for her to do sports like skiing and running.    They haven't got any help from estonian doctors and this disease is also the reason why they can't have a child. It would be very likely that their child will have the same disease.Can you tell what kind of disease this is and could it be prevented before a child is born?"
