"Due to my age (40), my doctor wanted to do an Amnio test and we elected not to because we were afraid of the miscarriage risk.    So, the doctor then offered the Quad Screen test and we agreed to do that one. I had the Quad Screen blood test done on the 27th of October at 16 weeks and just got a phone call on Nov.4th and the nurse said the test was positive for NTD/Brain Damage.    I asked what the ratio was and she said 1/25.    They have set up an appointment for me to see a specialist for an ultrasound on the 20th of this month and then we also have the big ultrasound on the 24th with my regular doctor.I know that the Quad Screen isn't as accurate as the Amnio but I'm extremely healthy and I wasn't expecting to get a reading like that (1/25).    Needless to say, I'm very concerned about it.    Has anyone had this kind of a result and what was the outcome?Also, I don't understand why the doctor would send me 3 hours away for an ultrasound and then he himself do another one 4 days later?    It seems like he should be able to detect the same things as the other doctor doesn't it?"
