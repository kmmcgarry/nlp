"I have had 3 miscarriages since January, one being a twin pregnancy. I just recently found out that I tested positive for Heterozygous MTHFR C677T. I saw a specialist (RE) at the Cleveland Clinic last week that told me this was niot causing my miscarriages. I have been tested and tested and tested and this is the ONLY thing I am positive for. I have seen that many people take baby aspril or take shots of heperan along with extra folic and B vitamins. PLEASE HELP! I just don't know who to believe and who not to believe."
