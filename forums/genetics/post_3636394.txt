"I have factor V homozygous, i am currently only taking aspirin. for the past 2 weeks my fingers have been turning blue. mainly my right hand,index,middle and thumb. 1st they thought it was my heart and did tons of tests but everything is fine. today...my index finger is grey,cold and numb. i have hemorrage splinters on my nail. the doc keeps telling me this is a side effect from factor V (even though this has never happened before) and that i shouldnt be concerned my finger wont die until it turns black. well....i dont wanna wait til my finger dies!!! any suggestions?? has this ever happened to anyone else??"
