"I was dx with Parkinson's then I had a DNA analysis and I have 2 H63D mutations which can cause HH. With all of the symptoms I have besides tremor, purpura, abdominal pain, pain, joint pain, darker skin, pain on right side rib area, etcHow do I find out if I actually have HH? The doctors will not tell me, not knowing is a terrible feeling."
