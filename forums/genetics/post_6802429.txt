"My son has autism and testing shows he has one MTHFR C1298A gene mutation.    The pediatrician says it doesn't mean anything and won't test his homocysteine levels.    My son's autism teacher believes he may also have MR.    I've read elevated homocysteine levels can cause MR in kids.    Should I push for his homocysteine levels to be checked?    I'm so confused and so tired of trying to be his doctor because all his actual doctors attribute every problem he has to autism.    Help!This discussion is related toI have just been diagnosed with MTHFR A1298C Homozygus."
