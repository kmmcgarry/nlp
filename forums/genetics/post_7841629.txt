"I'm an independant researcher on Circadian Rythym Disorders.    I'm working on a sleep/wake protocol for Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome Patients. It involves exposure to Ultra Violet B during the day and reverse chronotherapy in terms of sleep onset.I need to track down a Genetic possibility.    Can a group of people turn on or off switches by surgically altering themselves over a period of many generations.For example, hypothetically lets pretend that the earlobe makes a hormone, lets say testosterone.    And an isolated group of people, for example a tribe in the Amazon, figures out that if they chop off their ear lobes the behavior of the individual tribes person changes. They decide that this is desirable and make it a religious ritual.I'm looking to understand if this is a field of known science in Genetics and what its name might be so that I can research it further.    If over the course of thousands of years of earlobe removal could that tribe might start making significant changes to their makeup and begin to look quite different than other tribes in the region who do not practice their ritual?Hope this makes sense and please don't hesitate to ask me to rephrase."
