"I am not really close to anyone is my family, so I have no idea if I have family history of EDS.But vascular EDS is the most severe form of EDS and I am scared I have it.I am hypermobile, although it i'm not crazy hypermobile. I have stretchy skin. I can see veins underneath my skin. I have joint pain at times. I have problems with my tricuspid and mitral valves.I am terrified that I have vascular EDS and can pretty much die at any moment.Can somebody help me out with anything? I don't even know what to think right now I am so scared."
