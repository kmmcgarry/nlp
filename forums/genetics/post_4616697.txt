"Hello. I'am 20 years old and 20 weeks pregnant. This is my first pregnancy. I am half hispanic (my mothers from Honduras) and half white. The father of my baby is black. I am worried because at my 19 week ultrasound the doctor had some concerns that the nasal bone was not as prominent as he would like to see and I was referred to a high risk OBGYN. He too had difficulty detecting this nasal bone. I was told everything else was completely normal as far as growth, heart, brain, etc... He told me he doesn't think it is Downs Syndrome but I have been driving my self insane! My quad screen was normal, I don't remember what the numbers were. I opted to have the amnio done and wont have the reslults for another week!! I was just wondering if anyone had a similar experience and what the outcome was? Is it possible for everything to be normal except this absent nasal bone and still have a child with Downs?? I appreciate your replies. Thank you."
