"Hi, my dad was diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera about four months before he passed due to complications of the disease.    I am writing a nonfiction story about his battle with the disease and the disease itself.    I was wondering if anyone who is currently diagnosed with PV would like to help me spread the word about this horrible disease by telling me their story so that I can integrate it into my writing?    I know that this may sound strange or too forward, but from seeing what my dad went through, I feel responsible for informing people about the disease.    Please!"
