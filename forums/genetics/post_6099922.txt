"I am 19 years old, and I just found out that my mother may have cheated on my father about 19- 20 years ago.. right around the time I was conceived.. There is grandma and grandpa which are my dads parents.. I look more like grandma more then I do the rest of my family, and I do not look like grandpa at all. and the only reason I resemble my dad is because of his mothers features that he has as well.. BUT my grandma had another son.. with a different man.. and i have been lead to believe that my mom cheated on my dad with his brother... Now my dad is a little over 3/4 Cherokee Indian.. He has black hair.. a darker skin tone, brown eyes, and the long face.. his BROTHER.. from a different father.. has blond hair.. a lighter skin tone, blue eyes, and a round face.. my mother has brown hair.. very pale skin tone.. and blue eyes.. with a round face.. I have light brown hair.. blue eyes.. very pale skin and a round face.. i have looked at the different dominant and recessive genes.. and i have almost all recessive genes.. so wouldn't it be more likely to have ALL recessive genes if BOTH of my parents did as well?? is it possible that my mom has been lying all of these years? and that my uncle is really my father?? should i tell my dad and maybe have a test done??"
