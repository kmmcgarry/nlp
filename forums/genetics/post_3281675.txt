"I am 28 yrs old female and i recently got diagonosed with alpha thalassemia minor. before this discovery i was taking iron pills for about 2-3 yrs as directed by my doctor to correct for my low blood count or anemia. after discovering thalassemia i have stopped taking iron supplements. In the mean time i was also diagonosed with hypothyroidsm when i was taking iron supplements. Is thalassemia and hypothyrodism connected? also can intake of iron supplements from 2-3 yrs can cause hypothyodism?"
