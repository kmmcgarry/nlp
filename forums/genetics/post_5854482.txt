"Hi My lovely daughter was born by IVF (icsi with assisted hatching) and has unfortunately inhereted an unbalanced translocation between chromo 4 (missing from 35.2 tiny amount) but has additional chromo 11 from 22.3. Her dad is the balanced carrier of the same and we did not know prior to pregnancy (despite all the usual & advanced tests) that he had this. Lucy is now 11 months old and has low tone (trunk) and some gross motor development delay although is very bright, alert, verbal & plays with toys. She cannot sit, roll, crawl etc and has had silent reflux scince birth.She has to undergo three operations (general anestetic) later this year to fix a dislocated hip (was born breech). Does anyone know if she is at more risk of developing brain damage as a result or should she be at no more risk than ususal? Lucy also had unexplained ecoli septiceamia at 5 1/2 months but with medical help recovered fully.I would welcome any help as her particular chromosome make up is so rare. Thanks!"
