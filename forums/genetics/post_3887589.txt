"I suffer from migraine more that 40 years and recently they run a genetic test resulting that I'm heterozygous for the c677t mutation.Is there a relation betwen these mutation and migraine headaches???I've try every test every drug and more for my migraines (2 to 3 daily)...and after trying everything doctors sent me to pain clinic.Please anyone that can tell me more about those masive dosis of foliate acid and vitamine B...I'll try anything"
