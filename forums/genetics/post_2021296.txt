"hello, i am a 17 year old male, in good shape, very mild asthma.i am wondering about the genetic disposition to cancer i might have.my father had skin cancer which probably means i am prone to cancer ?but on my mothers side, my great-grandmother smoked a pack or more per day for 50+ years and had a super-human immunity to cancer, she never got sick, never had a heart attack, never devloped a tumor or any thing like that.i have been smoking maybe a cigarette (djarum black clove cigarette) or 2, maybe 3 maximum about every other day for about 2 years now.i was wondering what the probability of me getting lung\oral\throat cancer anytime soon would be if thats possibe or within your knowledge?"
