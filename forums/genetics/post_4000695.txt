"My daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006.    She is now 28 and it has metasizaed to her liver.    She has the BRAC2 gene and she is triple negative.    I was justed tested and have the BRAC2 gene also.    We're not suprised as it has run in our family for 4 generations now.    Now I will do consulting to decide what I need to do.    I am 58 and am feel very certain that I will have my ovaries removed and have a double masectomy.    I want to stick around as long as I can to help my family.    I just want to ask others that can relate to my issue what they decided when they found out about their BRAC 2 gene.    Any input would be greatly appreciated."
