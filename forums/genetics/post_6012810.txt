"I found out that i have eds only after my 12yr old was dx with it. I had nomal child birth aside from them being explosive. I am just wondering if my daughter, who i believe has eds, i just wonder if she should have children, and also if my boys choose to have children what are the chances that they will pass on eds to their children?"
