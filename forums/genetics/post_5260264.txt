"My daugther has a blood clotting disorder. MTHFR C677T and the A1298C. She had a blood test after she gave bith to stillborn in 2008 and a miscarriage in 2009. She has had 2 babies born 2002 & 2007 with no problems before the stillbith and miscarriage. She is now expecting again and must give herself daily shots of a blood thinner medications. I'm 57 yrs. old and I have given birth to three babies without any problems and no misscarriages. I'm on a hormone replacment patch. I don't smoke, my weight is great,    blood pressure is perfect, I don't have any health problems at all. Should I be tested for this blood clotting disorder?"
