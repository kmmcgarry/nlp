"I had a still birth in Aug it will be 2 years she had hydrops and multiple problems from down syndrome they said i only had a 1/2 of a one percent chance of having a baby with those problems and i did, should i be scared to have another baby? we had to wait for a week for her to pass, I also have a healthy 6 year old. I had a c-section with him. And how long should i wait after i get off the ring to start trying? One doctor told me i was going to be high risk and another told me it depends on the doctor that i get, one doctor said that the chance of it happening to me again are very slim. we had to go thru 3 diffrent doctors. please help just really scared and want to make the right choices. thank you"
