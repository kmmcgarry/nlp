"what is a better substitute for Bystolic 10mg?    I can no longer afford it.    I used to take Verapamil but thought it caused ear ringing.    After i stopped taking Verapamil I still have the ringing in my right ear.    My husband takes Metoprolol Tartrate.    I am thinking of using his which costs way less than Bystolic.    Please help."
