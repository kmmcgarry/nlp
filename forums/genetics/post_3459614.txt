"Greetings-I was diagnosed with Marfan's Syndrome when I was 13, after my father died of complications due to Marfan's.    I am now 44.    This last week, I went to my GI specialist regarding an abscess.    She suspects I have Chron's Disease.    After researching Chron's, I have found that I have most of the signs and symptoms associated with it.    I will be very surprised if I am not diagnosed with it after a colonoscopy this week.    I there evidence of a link between the two?Thanks-Smalltowngirl82"
