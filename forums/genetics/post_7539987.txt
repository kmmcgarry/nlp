"I have bilateral ptosis (i presume congenital it was diagnosed when i was 3 months old). I was also born with bilateral epicanthus (not due to ethnicity). Since childhood i am suffering worsening    exercise intolerence, fatigue and muscle weakness.Currently at age 24 I have an EMG showing a mild-moderate myopathy of proximal and more so in my distal and ocular muscles (mainly anterior tibailis and orbicularis oculi). (the ptosis and other muscles had no neuromuscular junction or neuropathic abnormality).on the basis of the EMG showing a myopathy is it likely that the ptosis is part of a wider muscle disorder not just a one off eye problem?Therefore and would you expect the cause of the ptosis and other muscles affected on the EMG to show in a muscle biopsy from the thigh?many thanks"
