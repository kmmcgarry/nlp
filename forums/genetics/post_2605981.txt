"I am 28 yo and this is my first pregnancy. I just got my nuchal fold screening and my dr. told me that the baby has a cystic hygroma of 7mm, 0-3mm being normal. he then highly suggested that i get the CVS test done to see if the baby will have downs or trisomy or any other chromosome abnormalities. so we just got it yesterday, now we have to sit and wait for the results. has anyone had a similar situation and the CVS test came back normal??    im a mess about this and i cant stop thinking about it...."
