"Okay here it goes, My last period was 11/8/2007 and i slept with a man on the 11/17/07 around 5am without a condom and he did ejaculate inside of me, i did go to the bathroom right after though, But then i got back together with my boyfriend around the 20th and i believe i had sex with him sometime through 11/20/07-11/23/07 , and he always ejaculated in me. I know that my ovulation date was 11/22/07 so who is more likley the father? So how long can sperm really live? I really hope its my boyriends otherwise my life is over. I have told both men and the one night stand said he wants nothing to do with it. And my boyfriend said he would only be there if it was his. And i want my boyfriend there, please help which is really more likley?"
