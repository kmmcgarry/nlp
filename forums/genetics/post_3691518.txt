"Has anyone gone through an ultrasound where everything is fine except that the nasal bone was not found? I am 23 weeks pregnant and am worried what this may mean for my baby. we had two ultrasounds and both times the radiologist could not find the nasal bone on our baby.    I know that it usually relate to DS so my husband and I are obviously worried.    This is our first child and I am only 27 years of age.    Does anyone have any experiences they could share that would help us decide whether we should have an amniocentesis or not? thanks."
