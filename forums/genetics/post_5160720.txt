"I am 25 years old, and was diagnosed with Factor V Leiden Heterozygous in 2006. I had multiple clots in my brain, and we believe I did have some in my arms as well. I am no longer on Coumadin therapy. I want to have a baby soon, but my issue is that my boyfriend had a vasectomy four years ago. I cannot take any type of hormonal treatments. Anybody have any ideas?Thank you,Rachel"
