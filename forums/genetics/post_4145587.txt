"Okay, so the man who is claiming to be my dad..I don't think he is my biological father and I have tried to tell him that, but he won't believe me. I mean, I don't even look like him and all of my friends know this. I tried to ask my mom for a paternity test, but she just said, 'No.' I tried to ask her questions about the man whom I think is my real dad, (questions such as 'Why did he die?'). Her voice cracked and I saw a tear slide down her face as she told me it was drugs. I honestly don't think the man is married is my dad. I mean--I'm not one bit like him, his whole side of the family treats me like I'm an alien, I don't look like him, plus there is a good possibilty that I am bipolar. And his family has no history of mental diseases or disorders. To top it off, he treats me like **** on a day-to-day basis.But my question is this: How can I get them to take a paternity test? I don't want a court one, but an at-home one. So, anyway how I can do it? I have been thinking about ordering one, telling them that its an allergy test (so they'll actually do it), and mailing off to the company who makes it. Also, are there any good, accurate paternity test out there I can get? (Again, I want this to be one I can do at home--like the one they have available at the DNA Diagnostics center)"
