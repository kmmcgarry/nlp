"I have a question regarding excessive masturbation and sperm quality.    At one point I    was masturbating 3x per day.    At the end of the week my girlfriend and I had sex and she got pregnant.    I am worried that due to my excessive masturbation, my sperm quality may me poor.    I have heard that chronic masturbation effects sperm quantity and volume but does it also effect sperm quality?    Will my sperm have a greater chance of genetic malformations due to overly masturbating?    Thank you."
