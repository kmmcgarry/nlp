"My wife and I both have short eyelashes. My 18 month old daughter has lovely long lashes. My wife is Filipino and I am Scottish (Caucasian). I didn't think it was possible then for my daughter to have long lashes unless I am not the father. I do believe my wife however, that she has had no other partner, but I can't explain the lashes.To the best of my knowledge all grandparents had short lashes too.So, is it possible?Thanks,David"
