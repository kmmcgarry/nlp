"HiOur daughter 4 month old daughter was just diagnosed with Aicardi Syndrome and we are desperately searching for as much information as we can possibly find.    Since she is not in school yet, we have not been able to find any local Aicardi groups.    We need to learn about seizure medications, developmental delay therapy programs and anything else that might help our baby.If anyone has any suggestions or if there are parents \"out there\" who have a child with Aicardi, I hope you'll get in touch with us.Thank youMichael"
