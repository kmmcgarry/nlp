"Hi, I am living in Thailand and they really do not have genetic counselling where I live, had a combined test of nuchal screening and blood test.    The results said negative risk for downs syndrome and had 1 in 3000 risk,    but then after it said that based on maternal age alone the risk was 1 in 130. This really confused me. I am 37 years old.My husband and I are concerned about chromosone abnormalities and not sure if we should have an amnio or not.    We are deciding whether to wait and have the 2nd trimester screening and see what those reults come up with or just have an amnio now instead of later, I was told that it was better to have the amnio around 16 weeks and this is next week. Do the results above sound like a high risk or low risk of downs syndrome. Any thoughts or previous experience would be greatly appreciated!!Thanks so much!!!"
