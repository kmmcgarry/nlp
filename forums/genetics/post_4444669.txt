"I have been diagnosed with - palandromic rheumitism, eye problems (episcleritis, blepheritis, lattice degeneration) I have had migraines for years but they are now always at the base of my skull and I have developed a mass on my upper back between my shoulder blades and neck (11cm X 7cm) that is growing along with inflammed lymph nodes in my neck. At least 3-4 times per week I wake up with severe lower back pain that goes away after a few hours but I can not walk very well and have trouble straightening. I have lightheadedness quite often. I have taken many anti-inflammatory drugs for my pain over the years but after taking a prescribed NSAID last year that I had been taking, I went in to anaphylactic shock and was in ICU for two days. They found my potassium levels were down at the time. I have taken prednisone for my episcleritis when it flares up with no problem for the last five years but 6 mos ago after taking it for a week I broke out in head to toe hives and had to stop. I am afraid to take anything for the pain now except Tylenol which really doesn't work. I believe all these things may be connected somehow. I have had no major medical issues until the last two years"
