"Dear Dr,My mother now claims I was born with a hole near my vagina. Firstly she claimed I had nappy rash and the scar on my upper thigh was a nappy rash scar- responses to childhood questioning. Adult questioning has resulted in this story of me being born with a hole near my vagina. She fobbed it off as if it was nothing. Further to this she claims I was sent home with betadine to wash my nappies in. The scar on my thigh is as a result of this hole, having moved as I grew.......I have had a Doctor look at it and confirm it is NOT a nappy rash scar. It presents as \"keloid like\" triangular approx 1inch in size in top inner thigh 2 inches down from leg/abdomen join.II have contacted the hospital of my birth, and having had the runaround for many years- denied access to birth records because I was not the patient- my mother was- just recently found th right terminology to make the hospital listen to me and allow me access to my records to find information I was seeking. Unfortunately my birth year was 1963, and they only held records from 1966 to current date.I wish to know what kind of test or proceedure was carried out on a newborn in those days. Could I have a scar like this from a skin biopsy? - a skin punch test ...? Could there have been some kind of urogenital surgery- maybe for enlarged clitoris or fused labia, and this information just not shared with me? I feel there is a scar in my labia minora- like they are 'sewn on\", and no- not a fold.I have had genetic testing, and a XX result was gleaned, subsequent to being informed I had Trisomy9 evident in two cells, then having that sidelined as a \"red-herring\" result.Could I in fact have a mosaic condition which has resulted in an irregularity in my genitals?
