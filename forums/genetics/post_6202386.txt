"I'm currently 19 weeks pregnant.I had an amnio two weeks ago and my genetic councellor called me yesterday indicating that the baby might have a chromosom translocation;but they can't complete the amnio test results becasue they need both me and my husband to get tested first to see which/IF any of us has chromosom translocation.Why do they need us to be tested?They already got the amniotic fluid via amnio from the baby.Whether or not we have it,isn't good enough to have some fluid from the baby for the LAB.They did not provide any details as to what kind of chromosom translation they identified.I just need clarification as to WHY we need to get tested since amnio on the baby is already done.Is this a common practice for other genetic LABs?Thnx in advance.This discussion is related tobalanced translocation."
