"I did the genetic screening at 12.5w (u/s and blood work) and again blood work at 16w.    The result came back with 1:30 risk for Down. The MoM values for AFP was 0.53, uE3 was 0.95, hCH was 2.3, NT was 1.17 and PAPP was 0.74. I will be almost 39 at the time of delivery and IÃ¢ € ™m also on 50mcg synthroid medication.IÃ¢ € ™m scheduled for amnio in two days but I also like to hear the opinion of one of your doctors about my results.Thank you very much."
