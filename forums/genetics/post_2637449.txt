"Hi, I am currently 23yrs old.This is pregnancy number 4. I have had one termination, one miscarriage and a live birth in August 2007.I am now 19 weeks pregnant.I had my ultrasound yesterday and this is what the report said:A single live foetus in cephalic presentation. Liquor volume is within normal limits and the placenta is anterior and clear of the internal cervical os. Bilateral small choroid plexus cysts are demonstrated. A isolated intracardiac echogenic focus is also present in the left ventricle. No morphologic abnormality is demonstrated. No Morphologic abnormality has been shown. Measurements are as follows:BPD: 45mmCH: 162mmAC: 142mmHL: 28mmFL: 29mmHeart Rate: 139bpmNasal bone: 6mmCerebellum: 19mmCisternamagna: 3mmNuchal Thickness: 3mmThe chord has three vessels.Conclusion:Measurements are appropriate for gestational age of 18weeks 6days. EDD 7/8/08.Choroid plexus cysts and echogenic intracardiac focus may be associated with chromosomal anomaly. Background risk for aneuploidy based on maternal age would be low and it remains low despite these findings.    The nasal bone is also noted to be of normal length.    This also reduces the lilelihood of chromosomal anomaly specifically down syndrome.    No nuchal translecency assessment is available.    No morphologic abnormality has been shown and the intracardiac focus has no bearing on cardiac function or morphology.Could you please explain what all of this means?!Is my baby ok?"
