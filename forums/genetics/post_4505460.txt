"Hi!I would ask that can that dna change in your life-time that passes to your children or I dont know exatcly what its called that passes to your chilren,but it is possible that your heritage can change in anyway from life-events,drug use,cigarette use.I have heard that taking SSRI√Ç ¥s can change your gene expression or dna or something,can those things be seen on my future√Ç ¥s child ancestry.I have tooken SSRI√Ç ¥√Ç ¥s and other mental healt medicines for my depression.but I have been really really short time on them.I also heard that re-actional drugs can alter your dna.I hope that they wont be seen on my chilrens.I hope you understand,since its somehow hard to explain,but my main question is this that will my heritage stay the same as my whole life-time or does it change from different issues?"
