"I have two healthy children when I was 33 and 35 with a 6 week miscarriage in between the two. My husband and I tried till I was 40 to get pregnant and even when to the fertility specialist. We decided to just give up on the baby dream at a 40 but hoped a miracle would happen one day. Anyway on my 43 rd birthday found out I was pregnant. I miscarried with D&C at 11 weeks and found out today I had a girl with down syndrome. I want another child so badly but so scared about having a Down Syndrome baby. What are my odds and what can I do to make my odds better?"
