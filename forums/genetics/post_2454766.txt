"My 2 yr olds father has type 1 diabetes (since he was 3) My son has shown many signs and he is only 2 1/2, we have some blood test ordered right now, but I heard something today that I was curious about, my coworker told me that 80% of our first borns genes comes from his father, is this correct? Does he have that much of a chance to have this?"
