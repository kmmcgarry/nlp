"My son was born with aplasia cutis. He has a small coin sized bald patch on the head. He is almost 4, is a great kid, happy, smart , terrible handsome and very sociable. Recently he asked me what is this thing he feels on his head when touching it. It doesn't seems to hurt him or bothering him. I was wondering just in case we ever consider surgery to remove the spot - if there is anybody there who did surgery for their baby , what do you suggest: to do it at this early age or just to wait for him to decide. What are the possible side effects if doing surgery now, what do we expect ?"
