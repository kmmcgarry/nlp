"I am currently almost 16 weeks pregnant with my first child.    I had an emergency sonogram done at 14 weeks 1 day because I was having a lot of pain and they were worried about my reproductive organs.    After about 10 minutes in with the sonogram tech. we were asked to wait for the doctor to return from the hospital so that she could talk to us.    I wasn't expecting to see the doctor unless they found a problem.    After less than 20 minutes the doctor came in and told my husband and I that our baby had Meckel Gruber Syndrome.    The doctor didn't know much about it except that it was 100% fatal.    She couldn't even tell us what the chances of it happening again were.    We are going to see a specialist soon but I am wondering if anyone has had what I feel is a rushed diagnosis like this?"
