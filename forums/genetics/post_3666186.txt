"I have tested positive        for heterozygous for factor V Leiden.My mother did not have it.....my father died before we were able to test him.My Older brother has it,        I do, Next brother doesn't, next sister does, next sister doesn't.My older brother's daughter has it, 1 doesn't and we are waiting on the result of 2 more of his children.The sister who has it.......one daughter has it and her son has it.    waiting on the results of 3 more children.The sister who doesn't...one child doesn't have it and waiting on testing of 3 others.My question is...........we have all been diagnosed heterozygous................can someone be homozygous? with the    2 genes....with us all being siblings and coming from the same parents?This discussion is related toMTHFR C677T Homozygous & Factor V Leiden Heterozygous."
