"Ok so, my little girl ( my only girl at that) was born at 35 weeks and 4 days, she weighted 3 lbs and 1 oz. She was born with a clef plat and a sever hair lip,. 2 days later they diagoned her with Edward Syndrome. What exactly is this disorder and can it be fixed ( in some case it can cause severe mental rerterdan)? I was reading on the internet that infants to children born with this condition, it usually ends up being fatal. We took her to a research hospital in a big town to see if maybe they can comeup with some answers, but the results will be not be in for a couple of weeks. Just to try to keep my saned I thought maybe I would ask around. Does antone have any similar stories or aadvise that might help ease my aniexy... any advise would be great advise right about now... thank you"
