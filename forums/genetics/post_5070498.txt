"My brother and I were tested a couple years ago for the Factor V blood disorder, and my results came back positive and his came back negative. I am young, only 14 years old. The topic of being pregnant and having Factor V came up in a conversation my mom and I were having a while back. My mother had said that if I ever become pregnant that I have to give myself a shot in my stomach every day. Is this true? If so, why? And, What does the shot do?My mother also has the Factor V blood disorder.I was reading an article about Factor V on the internet and something was said about miscarriages. I'm not looking to become pregnant anytime soon, I am just curious as to things I should know for the future. Are miscarriages likely to happen? Does anyone know the percentage of pregnancies that encounter a miscarriage?I wish to know more about my blood disorder, so any information would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
