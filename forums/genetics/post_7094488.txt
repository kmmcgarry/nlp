"My Mother has had Rheumatoid Arthritis for over thirty years, and before she was pregnant with me she was convinced to go to Mexico to see doctors there that put her on a number of drugs.    One of which was cortisone.    It wasn√¢ Ä ôt until she got back and had me, she saw an internal medicines specialist and found out she was on 60 √¢ Ä ì 100 mg of cortisone a day. She was on this high level of cortisone throughout her entire pregnancy with me.    Cortisone is a corticosteroid and is closely related to Cortisol and other steroids such as Aldosterone.So my question is; what can a high dose of Cortisone do to a Fetus?    Could it take a genetically (XX) Female, that without any interference would develop fully as a girl, and cause it to develop as a fully functioning male?    Could it cause androgens to develop the wolffian ducts to be stimulated into growth rather than the Development of m√É ºllerian ducts?    Then the fetus develops into a male baby.My entire life I have felt like a female spirit trapped in a male body.    I am just trying to figure out why I feel the way I do.Please, any information or help you can give would be appreciated,"
