"Hello √¢ Ä ì I√¢ Ä ôd appreciate any help or advise regarding my problem. I√¢ Ä ôll try to keep this as brief as possible. I am a male in my early forties. I have a pretty rare form of Brachdactylia and as a result my hands and feet have been affected by a form of Dwarfism. To put that in perspective my feet measure 10√¢ Ä ù from heel to toe and my hands are 6 √Ç Ω√¢ Ä ù from base of palm to tip of finger. My index finger measures just under 3√¢ Ä ù in length and my big toe measures 1 √Ç Ω√¢ Ä ù The rest of me is pretty average - I am 5√¢ Ä ô10√¢ Ä ô√¢ Ä ô with an average build and no other signs of dwarfism or shortness of bones. I've never discussed this with a doctor.Until recently the only problems associated with this condition have been a small amount of social stigma if someone notices and decides to make a remark. This doesn√¢ Ä ôt happen that often and I√¢ Ä ôve pretty much been able to deal with it in a positive way. I am conscious of it and do try and hide it as much as possible, hands in pockets or clenched fists, that type of thing. I know it√¢ Ä ôs a genetic problem and just one of those things, in fact the only real issue I√¢ Ä ôve found is that I can√¢ Ä ôt get a pair of gloves to fit that well, ladies gloves fit the fingers a little better but aren√¢ Ä ôt quite wide enough.Recently though, I have been getting severe pain in my hands and feet and I can only liken it to a muscle cramp or a very painful tingling feeling. Usually the pain comes when I awake but also happens at fairly regular intervals throughout the day and the symptoms last for about 15 minutes. I√¢ Ä ôm a little bit worried that these symptoms have something to do with the Brachydactylia. I know that the best thing to do is to go and see a doctor but I thought I would post on here first to see if anyone else has heard of anything similar."
