"I'm only a junior in high school but I am sure I'm going to go to med school,and am really curious about different medical specialties. One I'm extremely interested in is genetics/neurogenetics. I am very interested in the how the brain works in concordance with genetics,especially with mental diseases. So I'm wondering what kind of work there is out there for people in this specialty? How hard is it to reach this specialty? What kind of work do you do? Is this more scientific research based or clinical?Thanks so much :)"
