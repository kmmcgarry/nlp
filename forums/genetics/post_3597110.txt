"I am 36 YO. I've had 2 M/Cs in 2 years. First one at 8 wks, and two months ago at 17 wks. I am heterozygous (1 copy) for both MTHFR A1298C and Prothrombin G20209T gene mutations. My doc says this is a very rare combination and the risks are not \"quantifiable\".    I tested negative for Factor V Leiden, G20210A and MTHFR C677T. Does this have any connection to low platelets? (my counts avg between 60 and 100) Could this combination of genes cause recurrent pregnancy loss? Please help.This discussion is related toMTHFR A1298C."
