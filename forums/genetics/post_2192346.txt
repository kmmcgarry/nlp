"I was recently part of a paternity test.    I am hoping for a non-bias review of the results.    The results are as follows:Child/FatherD3S1358     15,16 / 16,17D7S820         10,11 / 11vWA                    15,16 / 15,16FGA                    20, 22 / 21, 22.2D8S1179     13 / 13,14D21S11         30, 35 / 29, 30D18S51         18 / 14, 18D5S818         10, 11 / 11, 12D13S317        11, 12 / 8, 12D16S539        11, 12 / 9, 11TH                         8, 11 / 8, 11CSF1PO        10, 11 / 11, 12Based on these results, what is your opinion on paternity probability?Mother's results on same markers:15, 1711, 1315, 182213, 1432.2, 35181011, 13126, 81111, 12I am confused by genetic mutations and parentage versus kin/relation.    Is it common for paternal alleles to have more exact combinations (ie. vWA, TH, TPOX)    than maternal?Please help me understand!Thanks!"
