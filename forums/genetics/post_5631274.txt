"Breast Cancer risks and genetic testingThis question is for anyone who has knowledge and experience regarding genetic testing (counseling). My recent mammogram results of (4/ 26) returned with benign findings... However, due to extensive family history of Cancer, including Breast and Ovarian Cancer; and, given my own history of developing microcalcifications (abnormal yet non-cancerous growths) in my breast, the radiologist√¢ Ä ôs recommendation was for me to seriously consider undergoing genetic testing. On the other hand, my lifelong family physician questions the value of this approach, √¢ Ä ú√¢ Ä ¶ knowing that [I] will not be having children.√¢ Ä ù I√¢ Ä ôm inclined to agree with my doctor and not pursue testing; however, my mother (whose two sisters died of Breast Cancer) is pushing for it. Before I make a decision, I√¢ Ä ôd like to know the insights and opinions (pros and cons) of any of you who have had or know of anyone who has had genetic testing. Thank you in advance."
