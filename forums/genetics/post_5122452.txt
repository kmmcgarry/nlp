"Hello medhelp!I have a question or rather ;kind of a funny feeling and I want to know if what I am feeling is normal or not.Yesterday one of my neighbours had a bad accident and I had to take her to the emergency all the while holding her hand and consoling her and she was in extreme pain and when the doctor gave her a shot of pain killer; soon after, I started to feel extremely dizzy and faint and I almost fainted* and then the doctor asked me to get out of there!!!Why did this happen to me??It felt really really strange, is this normal? Why? how?? i mean, its strange!!! Or i jus lack common knowledge??"
