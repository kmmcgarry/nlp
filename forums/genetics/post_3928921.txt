"Hello,I have a 19,999 nucleotide sequence given to me.    I need to find out what the locus for this sequence is, the proteins it codes for, the non-coding regions, and look for any knock-out -- listing the phenotype for these knockouts.I've used the MGI database and I've found a 100% match with 19999 nucleotides.    It is on Chromosome 2 matching 71366000bp-71385998bp.The genes that are found near and around this region are:http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/marker_report.cgi?op%3AmarkerSymname=contains&markerSymname=&symnameBreadth=CM&markerType=0&chromosome=2&op%3Acoords=between&coords=71366000-71385998&coordUnits=bp&startMarker=&endMarker=&op%3Acytoband=%3D&cytoband=&op%3Aoffset=between&offset=&op%3Ago_term=contains&go_term=&_Ontology_key=Molecular+Function&_Ontology_key=Biological+Process&_Ontology_key=Cellular+Component&interpro=&phenotypes=&clone=&sort=Nomenclature&*limit=500&format=WebHow can I proceed to find what genes were knocked out if I know the reference assembly strain I matched? Is there anyway to compare the sequences so I know which I'm missing?    How about for proteins? And how do I interpret the coding and non-coding sections?"
