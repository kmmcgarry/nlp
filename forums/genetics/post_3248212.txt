"My 23 year old son has homozygous for the H63D mutation and Og2y2 mutation.    His spleen is enlarged and needs to be removed. Also, his gallbladder needs to be removed. He has esophageal varices. I have tried to research online about this type of hemochromatosis but have not been able to locate any information regarding this rare form. If you have any information please respond. Thankyou"
