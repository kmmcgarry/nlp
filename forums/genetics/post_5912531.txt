"My friend's mom just had a baby. During the pregnancy there was a slight amount of hydrocephalus but that mostly disappeared by 36 weeks. The baby was due on august 2nd, but the mother began to have contractions on july 10. The c-section was preformed on July 13. The baby was born with no physical deformations. She has told me that there has been some genetic problem, where there was a mutation on chromosome 20. She says that this will cause some level of mental retardation that is not yet known. She also says that this disease is so rare that they are the only family in the United States to have it and that it's so rare it doesn't have a name. Is there anything anybody knows about this?"
