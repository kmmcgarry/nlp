"I have just learned that I have pericentric inversion of chromosome 10 inv(10)(p11.2q21.2).    I have had 16 documented and countless other miscarriages.    I read that the inversion can be tricky to combine with normal chromosomes... is this why I have had so many miscarriages?    Now that I know this, should I not pursue another pregnancy?    I do have 2 live children (one of which has autistic traits father wont allow him to be evaluated).    I have 3 ureters and an extra heartbeat.    My daughter seems fine.    My new husbands chromosomes tested fine with no variations.Thanks for any help!"
