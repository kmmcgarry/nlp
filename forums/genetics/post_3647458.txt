"Hi, I am rohini from India. I am 27 yrs old female. For the past 4-5 yrs I have been suffering from severe back pain, legs pain and multiple pains in various parts of body. Initially i was informed by doctors that I had a slipped disc due to which pains were transmitting in back, legs, arms, shoulders etc. Later last year I came to know that I am hla b27 positive. My rheaumatologist started giving me steroids n pain killers which I was alreday using twice or thrice a day for last 3-4 yrs. Now my CRP has come down to 9 n ESR is 23 but still i have alot of pains in back n legs. No pain killers given by doctor is helping me much. I have gained alot of weight. I am 5' - 3'' tall n weigh around 75 kgs. Now Dr. says I shud take a treatment called Remicad (am not sure how do we spell it). But he said that relief from pain is not guranteed even after this treatment. It will cost me much.. pls suggest shud i go for this treatment or not. What can be possible effects of this treatment on me? If we plan to have a baby, will my baby also suffer from pains whole life?pls guide me"
