"I am 21 years old, My father is 5'9'' and mother is 5'1''. I am still 5'4''. I believe my puberty started around 18. I have not seen any height change in a year. I am constantly being told that I look more like a 15-17 year old. How long will my puberty last?? and is there any chance that I will grow anymore. My body almost stopped growing when i turn 12 until I was 17, then it started growing little by little. My grandfather is 5'5'' and my uncle is about 5'8'' (I don't know if its relevant or not.)"
