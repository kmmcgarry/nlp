"My mother has stage 4 grade 3 breast cancer a couple years back. My mother now test postive for Brac2 gene. My mother had a lump remove. My questions is if you have a mastectomy can you get the cancer back and if you have reconstruction can you get the cancer back or get it in that area. Also if you have the overio remove can you get other cance down there? Thanks kelly"
