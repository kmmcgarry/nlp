"My daughter was just diagnosed with having mutations on the CLCN1 Gene.    Does this mean that she has the recessive form of Myotonia Congenita or Becker's Disease?    Or does it mean that she received 2 recessive genes from her dad and I which makes her situations even more severe?    I also would like to know of Becker's Disease is the same thing as Beckers MD?    I haven't found any information on females having this form of Muscular Dystrophy.    Is there a source for more info?"
