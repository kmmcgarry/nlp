"I really need some advice im torn in to.    ok so here it goes, Thomas and I are ready to start trying for another kid Brendon will be about 2 when its born and I want them to be close in age.    The genetics dr told us that brendon has primary micro and that norm kids with this disorder both parents are carriers. When I brought up the fact that we were ready for another child she told us we had a 1 n 4 chance of this happing again.    I have looked into artifishal inserination with sperm donation and im waiting on my dr to refer me.    I called the drs office to get prices and im looking at paying about 1300 per cycle.    I dono wat to do. I dono if its werth taking the risk and doinng it natrual or spending the money (which i really dont have) and hoping it works.    Any advice would be great.    Thanks"
