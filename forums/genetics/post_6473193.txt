"I have a 7 year old daughter who suffers from ataxia and ptosis. Her condition has been undiagnosed and it is extremely frustrating. My husband and I are first cousins, we have no family history of any medical conditions similar to what my daughter has. What would be our chance of conceiving a second healthy child? My daughter is our only child.This discussion is related toconsanguinity."
