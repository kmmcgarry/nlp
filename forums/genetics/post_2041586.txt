"Hello, I find this completly and totally embarrassing to ask. But I think I could possibly be a hermaphrodite. I am 16 years old, and honestly, I wouldn't know any of the symptoms because I know my body, but I don't think I know well enough to tell. I will state what I think are my symptoms.I found this a concern when I started to masterbate more. Exploring my insides I mean. I am a virgin of course, and not 3 inches into me there is a lump like form it is slightly hard but I am unsure of what it is. It is very short, not like a penis at all really. Then, I am also aware that anal sex the walls of the vagina are very thin and connected and maybe currently right below this formity, I am feeling two small ball-like shapes, it could just be 'waste' I assume. I am just wondering if this could be normal. If not, I am scared to death.I have a normal period, breast formation and everything else puberty wise is normal. I am a woman, but this is something I am concerned with. What should I do?"
