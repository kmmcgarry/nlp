"Hi, i have historically low WBC and anemia...the WBC count is anywhere from 2.3-3.5 and the iron counts are:HGT 4, HCT 35-36 ...My hemotologist tells me that this is normal for me...the problem is i can't fight off infections or they linger, or i get strange infections...i take iron, folic acid, cats claw, b12 and slew of vitamins and minerals to get my immune system working...my mother has the same thing going on with her and nearly died from septicemia (her mother did!) and    i ended up with it too! can anyone explain why we are 'blessed' with such lousy immune systems???wash my hands alot"
