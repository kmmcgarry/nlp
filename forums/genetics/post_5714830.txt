"Hello WomynI have had my sequential screen results returned to me...my Down's risk was 1:7,000, T18 risk 1:10,000, NTD risk 1:1,500.    The baby had an echogenic focus in the heart (EIF) at the 20 week scan, but I was assured this means nothing considering my numbers, which both the doctor and the tech said were \"great\".My question for you all is:     How seriously can I take these numbers?    I know the sequential, or integrated, screen has a 92% accuracy rate.    Which I assume means that 8% of women who get good numbers in fact have a baby with Down's or another problem.    How can I tell if I might be in that 8%?    Would my numbers be a lot worse (I am 30 and was told these are excellent numbers to see on the test)?    Maybe the 8% are closer to the 1:500 range; that is, closer to the cutoff for an amnio.    Or is it a total shot in the dark?    Can somebody with a 1:7,000 risk, as assessed by the screening, have a child with Down's?I am nervous about this, because of the EIF, but also because I always seem to fall into the small percentage category (like, my blood type is not only negative, but also the rarest type on the planet).    Since my numbers were so \"great\", I'm not being offered a meeting with the genetic counselor, let alone an amnio (which I don't really want anyway).    Please, somebody let me know what the deal is with this.thanks a million,Taffy"
