"I'm an undergraduate Genetics student in my third year now. I really want to make the most of next summer and gain some practical work experience in the area. I'd love to go to America to do so. I've been looking up stuff on the internet but I'm not coming up with much for undergraduates. Maybe I'm not looking properly! Any suggestions as to where I should look? People I should contact? Websites? I don't know where to start!"
