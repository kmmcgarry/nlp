"Hi, I wrote to you on the 06 Jan regarding our pregnancy that was affected by spina bifida.    Our little baby girl was stillborn on the 03 Feb. She also had severe hydrocephalus.     She survived up until about 10 minutes before she was born.I was just wondering what are the chances of this happening us again if we ever decide to get pregnant again. There is no spina bifida in either of our families, so would you suggest for us to get genetic counselling.    Also i took the recommended amount of folic acid before and during the pregnancy."
