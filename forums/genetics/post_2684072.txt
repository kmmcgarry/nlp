"A woman I was with is pregnant. I had protected sex with her on Januray 4th or 5th. A condom which did not break, slip off, or appear to be damaged in anyway upon inspection (before insertion and after withdrawal). I withdrew immedialty upon if not during ejaculation into the condom. While the sex I had was protected during penetration it is possible that bare penis rubbed against vulva prior to penetration and that pre-ejaculate might have been deposited there. I suppose it's possible that the pre-ejacualate found it's way into her or that somehow sperm leaked out of the base of the condom. What are the chances? I think both those scenarios are unlikely.She had unprotected (withdrawal method with her intoxicated ex-boyfriend) sex on December 31st. Due date is expected to be 9/18/08 (she was 14 weeks pregnant on 3/20 or 3/21), so the baby is either his or mine and given the scenario probably his. While I understand it's possible that the baby is mine, I believe it is unliklely given the scenario described above. We must wait until the baby arrives, ~6 months, to prove paternity for certain. I'm driving myself crazy with worry in the meantime. Don't know how I can last 6 months of this.I simply don't know the probabilites. I would very much appreciate a physician's opinion (hopeful that it will give me peace of mind) on how much I should worry. Is this a 1 in 100, 1 in 5, 1 in 1,000 scenario that it's mine?    Just found all this out and I'm scared (obviously).PS, not that it's relevant because it clearly didn't work, but she was on the pill."
