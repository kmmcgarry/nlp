"Hello,I was diagnosed with alpha thalassemia trait some years ago.    I have mild anemia.    It's nothing severe, but it is frustrating on a day-to-day basis to start feeling fatigued and lose concentration after only a few hours of work, especially once I've had lunch.    My work/career is very important to me, and I am very ambitious.Is there anything I can do or take to have more energy and concentration?    I eat healthy (a lot of fruit, etc.), and I jog, do sit-ups and push-ups regularly.    I don't drink coffee or energy drinks.I would deeply appreciate your medical advice.    Thank you."
