"I recently was diagnoised with rhumatoid arthritis    and have a history of being homozygous for factor 5 leiden. My question is does this inflamatory disease have any affect on my factor 5. I have been fortunate enough to not have had any problems with my factor 5 and only take an aspirin a day for this condition. Thank you"
