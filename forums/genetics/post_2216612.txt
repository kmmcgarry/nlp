"I am 41 yrs old, my wife is 37yrs. The first pregnancy resulted in a Missed Abortion 10yrs ago. Then we had a Normal Boy who is 8 yrs old. In 2003 we had a second boy with Down's Syndrome, who expired in Jan 2007. Again my wife was pregnant this August, but had a Missed Abortion at 10weeks. The products of conception were sent for testing and the result came out to be TRISOMY 16. Do we need to undergo any further investigations?? Should we try for another child or just give up??"
