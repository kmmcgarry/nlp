"Hi there I was recently Diagnosed with HHT also knows as Osler Weber Rendu I have had genetic testing done and the gene causing my HHT has not yet been found due to not enough research, was tested for HHT1 HHT2 and the SMAD4 ,I was wondering if there was any research being done and If I could possibly donate my blood for research to find these genes to further help my family and to help others! I was told that 40% of us the gene has not been detected yet. I clearly have a clinical Diagnosis of this! Multiple PAVMs Telegictasias and nose bleeds"
