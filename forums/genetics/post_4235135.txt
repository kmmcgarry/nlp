"My 7 mo old daughter was recently diagnosed with metopic synostosis. However, two surgeons agree that she will not require surgery on her skull but because she has face asymmetry she needs to see a craniofacial surgeon. Her neurologist couldn't tell be looking at her if her right eye is smaller than the left or it it is bone structure. He suggested that I take her to a pediatric opthamologist while I am waiting for the appointment with the craniofacial surgeon. I took her to a pediatric opthamologist yesterday and he said they eye itself seems to be the same size but that there is another problem. She appears to have cataracts in both eyes. He will have to do surgery on her next week also to remedy clogged tear ducts and to get a better eye exam while she us under anesthesia. I asked him what he thought was most likely the cause for cataracts in infants and he said he suspected a metabolic disorder and that I needed to call my pediatrician and her her order blood work. Of course I came home and googled the information and was not comforted by what I read. I am wondering if anybody knows which disorders ore most commonly associated with congenital cataracts?"
