"If an unltrasound shows both Echogenic intracardiac foci and single umbilical artery does that make the risk even higher for downs or can it just be something to watch and may mean nothing?    I am waiting for the amnio to come back but am very stressed.     I'm 18 weeks and 36 years old.    Thanks"
