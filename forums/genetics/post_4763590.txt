"Hello:    I would like to know if skin elasticity is the determining factor in deciding if a patient has EDS.    I have many of the symptoms but my skin is only mildly elastic and then only in a few spots.    I have many of the other symptoms but my doctors says there is no way I can have the disease without having more skin elasticity than I do.     Thank you so much"
