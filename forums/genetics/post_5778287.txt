"Welcome to everyone - new and existing members!    If you are new here, please feel free to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about why you are here.    Please post any questions, concerns, or issues that you have relating to or about Genetics.If you do not wish to post openly on this forum, (If I can help answer a question that you might have) please do not hesitate to send me a message or note directly.    Often times new members visit here because they have just received troubling information or are experiencing something they can't explain.    This discovery can sometimes be an uncomfortable or stressful/trying time.    If this is your situation, remember many of us have been in your exact situation, and know better than anyone what you are facing.    More importantly, we have discovered that while medical advice is usually the best route when we have questions, having others to ask or relate to can go a long way.Many of the members here are full of knowledge and have personal experiences with questions that you may have.    Personal experiences are sometimes the best answers to many questions.    Please keep in mind, that while we may have extensive knowledge in many areas, members should always seek professional medical advice from their own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Again, welcome and please enjoy this forum.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator"
