"I unknowingly received the DPT vaccination at a routine doctor's appt., only to find out a couple weeks later that I was pregnant.    I would've conceived within a week of the vaccine and know I'm scared that this may cause problems with my pregnancy or lead to birth defects.    Any information is appreciated.Thanks"
