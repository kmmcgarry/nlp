"I have incontinentia pigmenti and i lost my baby at 16 weeks,but my baby past when I was 12    to 13 weeks and I didnt know I had a Dr. appt on the 14th but they changed it to the 20th to go to a high risk Dr. to get a test to see if my baby had It cause it was a boy but I asked the Dr when I had the baby on the 14th he said it was 1000 dollars and I didnt have the money. Whats the chance that my baby had IP?"
