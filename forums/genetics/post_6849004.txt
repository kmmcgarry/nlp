"Dear doctors,I am not sure if this is the correct forum to post but hope you can help.I am an 20 adult survivor of childhood leukemia.I have been doing some research into my history and have discovered that 23 of my chromosomes are inverted. The oncologist who treated me said that he has never seen a case like this before.Could you please comment on this finding? Can these kind of abnormalities cause cancer or possibly other diseases such as autoimmune disease.I am worried that this could pose a greater risk of me developing cancer    again and/or some other health issues as an adult.    I have been having some troubling symptoms over the past few months and can't find any answers.Thank you for reading my question."
