"I have an inherited thrombophilia related to Factor II deficiency. My two sons also have MTH FR mutation (A-1 298 C) and are heterozygotes. I may also have other clotting abnormalities as I have only been tested for the factor II. Several of my family members have had DVT's and both of my parents have had PE's. My Mom apparently has Leyden factor V, while the Factor II comes from my Father's side of the family. Since I am now 49 I'd like to find a physician that has some specific knowledge of these blood clotting issues. My oncologist and a vascular surgeon I have seen have both played down the disorders due to the rarity of them, and I think a lack of knowledge about them. How can I find a Doctor who knows more about blood clotting disorders and specifically thrombophilia? Thanks so much!"
