"We recently adopted our son in July 2010.    he is 6 months old now.    Various members of his birthfamily have Hemoglobin Koln.    His birthmohter does not have it, but her mom, her sister and an uncle do.    What are the chances that our son will have it?    And is there a definitive test that can be done to know if he has it or not?    If so, when should he be tested?    Also, if he does have it what do we need to know about living with it?Thanks!"
