"I had a DVT at 21 on BC. Then several more during and after prenancy at 30.    Was diagnosed with MTHFR during pregnancy and told to take high doses of B6, B12 and Folic Acid and avoid ALL hormones.    Now, 9 year later, I want more answers and want to see a specialist but don't know where to start.    I want to be re-tested and have more clarification.    My health has been destroyed and I need to fit the pieces of the puzzle together.    I believe the MTHFR is perhaps a major cornerstone in my health issues.Anyone have some insight or know where to find a specialist in Phoenix AZ?"
