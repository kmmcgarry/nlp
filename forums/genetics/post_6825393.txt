"Question. I am going through testing for celiac diseas and the NIH.gov info sheet said that people with celiac have a higher chance of Downs. Does that mean that I have a higher chance for a Downs child in pregnancy? Our first child (via IUI) is healthy and fine (tested via amnnio). But it is a concern for us in having a 2nd child."
