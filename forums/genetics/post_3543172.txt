"I am soooo scared. My doctor just called me over the phone to inform me of this condition my baby has plus dilated kidneys. I am wondering if the deep sonogram that the specialist will perform in my next appointment will be a 100% accurate to rule out birth defects, and if he does, what are other complications I should expect for the baby to have? WIll there be a chance that my baby can die before I give birth? during birth?, or after? Will she be born early? Will I be able to still have a vaginal birth? And if I decide to do an abortion incase there are severe birth defects, does that affect me trying to get pregnant again since it would be such a late term abortion? By the way, Im 29, 22 weeks pregnant and this is my first baby and my husband and I don't have a history of birth defects in the family that we know of. Also, how safe is the Amnio test really? I have done tons of research online, but would like a professionals advice. Thank you."
