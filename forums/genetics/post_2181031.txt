"Had sex with female Jan 6, 2007. Found out Feb 6 She was pregnant. She informed me she had sex with someone before me on New yrs Eve, and    a different person weeks after me. She was given the due date of Oct 16th. The child was born Oct 11th.First guy took test it was negativeI took the test, it was negativeIs it possible she could have taken the wrong baby? Even though on the DNA results I was sent all 3 parties were listed. The mother was first, her DNA info, the child and her DNA info, then me and my DNA info.They do take pictures and id and thumbprints...maybe I should just be thankful and leave it alone huh?thanks"
