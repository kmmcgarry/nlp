"My 5yr old daughter is DX'ed with a rare eye disorder (actually a couple disorders wrapped into one) called ''ocular melanosis with episcleral pigment & diffuse iris nevus''. Her right eye is about 80% affected & her left eye is developing 2 spots as well. She is also DX'ed with ADHD-combined, ODD, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, mild verbal apraxia, & ''disorder of infancy, childhood, or adolescence NOS''. Ocular Melanosis (OM) has little info available but after research I have found a few others with ''OM kids''. All our affected kids also suffer similar behavior, emotional, &/or speech disorders. Is there a possibility this is all part of a genetic disorder?? It seems very odd that 3 children from different parts of the world, all suffer with the same rare eye disorder as well as the same adjoining disorders..."
