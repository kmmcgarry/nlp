"I am a 30 year old, and this is my first pregnancy. I recently took the quad screening test. My results came back positive for possible Downs syndrome and trisomy 18. The ratio they gave was 1:347. Now I am totally freaked out!! They said test is very sensitive and and only a screening.    I am going in a week for a ultrasound so they can check on markeWhat do they look for in these ultrasounds? Has anyone else ever recieved positive results and it turned out tone nothing?"
