"My son is almost 13 months old.    A week before his 1st birthday he started to sit.    He is not great at it but is getting a little better.    He is very hypermobile in all joints but his elows.    He can not crawl or pull himself up.    He just started scooting a little but gets very tired very fast.    He was diagnosed with SVT (superventricular Tachycardia) at 3 weeks old and has been on a bata blocker since.    We have seen a neurologist and a genetisis but they are not sure. Please help or any ideas?!!!!!"
