"I have attempted to become a father in the last two years twice through IVF. In both cases the pregnancy terminated at or about the 20 th week. we were informed of this at the ulra sound. Prior to discovering this    the second time we were told that our UE3 level was very low,( .18 ) later we tested for smith lyndley opides and chromesognal defects both tests were negative. I am open to suggestion and opinion as to what is happening."
