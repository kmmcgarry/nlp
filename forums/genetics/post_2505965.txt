"My daughter was born with KTW.    She was seen in the genetics clinic at the children's hospital.    She has a large hemangioma that covers most of her back, part of her right arm/hand, the right side of her abdoman and some small spots on her left buttock/upper thigh.    My concern is about her foot and left ring finger.    Her left foot is 1 1/2 cm bigger than her right and her second toe is much longer on that foot as well.    Her ring finger on her left hand is bigger than the rest of her fingers.    I am concerned that they will continue to grow at an abnormal rate and that could present problems when she learns to walk.    She is going to be evaluated for OT--when she was born her hands were fisted and the thumb was over the middle finger and held them down and it is difficult for her to extend them.    Any information you can give me would be appreicated.    The Dr. in the genetics clinic is just monitoring her at this point and she will go back in six months."
