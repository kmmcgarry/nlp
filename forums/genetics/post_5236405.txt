"I have recently been diagnosed with MTHFR I got it from both of my parents.    I have had 3 miscarriages and a    pregnancy that had to be delivered at 28 weeks due to HELLP Syndrome.    My doctor says that since the MTHFR that I have is A I do not require any blood thinner shots.    I have been on a baby asprin with the last two miscarriages.    I would like to know what is this compound Heterozygous MTHFR that i was reading on another post.    I know I need to consult with my doctor but do you have any suggestions"
