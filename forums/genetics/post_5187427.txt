Based on the DNA analysis, the alleged father lacks the genetic markers that must be contributed to the child by the true biological father in the following system(s):D7S820, D163539, vWA, D18S51 and D5S818.     The loci at which the alleged father lacks the genetic markers contributed to the child by the true biological father are listed above with a paternity index equal to zero."
