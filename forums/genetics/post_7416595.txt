"My 15 month old daughter has pale optic nerves (optic atrophy), hypotonia, and is globally delayed. We are going through genetic testing and the below tests have all come back normal.1. Chromosomal Microarray2. OPA1 Gene Sequencing (Optic Atrophy Type 1)3. Lactic Acid Levels4. Pyruvic Acid5. Plasma Aminoacids6. Urine Organic Acids7. 3-Methylglutaconic aciduria (3MGA)8. Peroxisomal disorders9. Congenital disorders of glycosylation10. Creatine deficiency disordersHowever, they did find a rare variant (m.1007G>A) in her mitochondrial DNA of √¢ Ä úunknown clinical significance.√¢ Ä ù Next steps are muscle biopsy and my wife is having her blood tested for that same rare variant.We are interested in having another baby but would like to know the chances of a similar condition appearing in our next baby? If my wifes blood does not show the same variant as was found in our daughter does that decrease the chances of a reoccurrence?"
