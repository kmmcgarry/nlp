"Hi!i I was born with a strange malformation,but until today just I can see it.I'm 21 yrs old.since i was little,i observed that half of my body(the left one,head to toes),is developed different from the other.for example,the left part of the head is not as wider as the right one,the left lung is smaller,left arm is not as thick as the right one and the left    leg the same.i also observed that the left part of my body has a stronger and more developed skeletal system,and also the circulatory system.the right part of my body has a more developed respiratory and muscular system,but the circulaory and skeletal are less stronger.THIS IS NOT A JOKE!Biology is my passion since i was little but i have never heard of a genetic disorder like mine.Other seem not to observe my malformation,but i can see it,and it is very obvious thati have 2 different halfs of body.pls answer.I'm desperate."
