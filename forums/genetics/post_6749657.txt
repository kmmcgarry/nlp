"The day of my last menstrual period was december 10th and it ended on december 14th. On december 15th and december 17th I had unprotected sex with a friend but he did not ejaculate in me. I did not have sex again until december 24th, this time it was with my husband.    We had unprotected sex 2 times that night and he ejaculated in me both times. I researched things online and they all said my most fertile day was the 24th. When I went for my first ultrasound, the doctor had prewarned me that the date of conception may be off cause I was farther along in my pregnancy than other women. My ultrasound was on march 16th and the computer said I was 13 weeks and 1 day. I found that to be highly inaccurate cause 13 weeks and 1 day ago I was still on my period. I need some guidance as to whom is my babys daddy, my friend? Or my husband? Could the ultrasound machine been off and could I just have a larger than normal child? Please help."
