"My 35 month old daughter just had genetic testing done because of her moderate and severe delays ( mostly speech but she does have occupational, speech, and physical therapy) and the neurologist called and told me that she doesn't have down syndrome but mentioned something about seeing a Variant and said that me and her father need to get tested as well in order to understand what is going on with our daughter. Can you please tell me what a variant is and what are the risks of this? Should we see a genetic specialist? and how would me and her father getting tested help?"
