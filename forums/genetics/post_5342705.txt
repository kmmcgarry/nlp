"Hello everyone!I have a history of having a Red face along with a feeling of Burning on face from last many years.I have done many CBC in last    years and my RBC, Hemoglobin and Hemotocrit get elevated and come back to normal. I have repeated this test many times but results are not consistant.More than 2 CBC Tests were done in 2008, 2009 and 2010 (2+ in each year).MAX RBC Noticed: 5.74     (Range for my age: 4.10    - 5.60)MAX Hemoglobin Noticed: 17.6     (Range for my age: 13    - 17.2)MAX Hemotocrit Noticed: 51.3     (Range for my age: 36.0    - 50.0)Now these levels are normal but a few months back HCT and HGB were high.Do you think I have Polycythemia ? Should i be concerned?-Akhil-"
