"At 12 weeks my baby had Cystic Hygroma, so we had a CVS done. The CVS results came back 46xx normal. I gave birth 10-30-07 to a 3 pound six ounce baby girl at 37 weeks.My little girl has a cleft lip, VSD, PDA low set ears strawberry shape head, small mouth, small eyes, webbed toes, and other abnormalities.The doctors ran another chromosome test, this test came back that the baby has Trisomy 18.How is it possible that the CVS done at 12 weeks comes back normal and this test comes back with Trisomy 18.I thought the reason of the CVS test was to discover such chromosome abnormalities.Please help"
