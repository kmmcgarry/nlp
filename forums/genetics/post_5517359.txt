"I have been suffering from muscle pain and weakness for about three and one half years.    I have had two MRI's and seen three neurologists.    My large muscles, mostly my arms and legs are weak and feel \"squeezed\" at times.    The pain can be unbearable at times.    I currently take 1200mg of neurontin, 800 mg CoQ 10, 15 mg, meloxicam daily.    I also have a cream used topically for the needle like pain I get in my toes.    The weakness seems to have been stable for the past 6 months.    The pain has been off the charts for about two weeks.    I have recently been having some breathing issues and have a chroninc or irritative cough since 9/2009.    I do have arthritus in my spine.    EMG's are normal.    MRI's show white matter damage, but supposedly doesn't look like MS.Do you know of a condition that may be causing this?"
