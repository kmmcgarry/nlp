"Hi, I'm aware of having six congenital anomalies, and have read that if you have three or more that you are likely to have MCA (Multiple Congenital Anomaly Syndrome).I've been chronically ill for 20 years, diagnosed with Chronic Lyme Disease in 2005, last two years am bedridden.    I'm desperate to find diagnosis's that have treatments that will make you feel better.What should I know about MCA, is it likely I have it, is there a list of specific ones?Thanks"
