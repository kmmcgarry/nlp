"Sir, im 22 years oldLast Night I am getting wet by cold rain for about 30min then before going to sleep I masturbate then I go to sleep. In the morning I noticed there's swelling all around the penis foreskin ( I don't feel any pain when I urinate or touch my penis foreskin) . I'm    very worried . Please tell me what to do."
