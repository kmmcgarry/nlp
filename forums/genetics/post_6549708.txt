"As a child a coach noticed that my arms didn't straighten all the way.    It is both arms and they don't hurt.    I also have never broken my arms or injured them in any way. What could this be? Is it a birth defect?I also have some other bone issues such as mild scoliosis and reverse lordosis of the cervical spine.    Most notably I have a Chiari malformation that was operated on in 2009.    I still have a lot of pain in my head, neck and back.    Who should I see about this? Should I have my arms checked out?    Are they related? Thanks for your help!"
