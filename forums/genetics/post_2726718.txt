"Hello...My brother (40) has a history of iritis and is positive for the hlab27 gene.    When my older daughter was 2 she came down with erythema multiforme.    When she    was 12 she was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease.    My youngest daughter who's 4 now had a case of erythema multiforme last fall.    I recently stumbled across an article linking EM to the hlab27 gene and another one linking Crohn's Disease to hlab27.    What should I do in regards to having my kids tested for the gene?    Is there any way to avoid my younger daughter developing iritis, Crohn's, or any other hlab27 condition if we know she is positive for the gene now?Thank you."
