"i am 5 months pregnant, this is my first pregnancy & i found out it is a boy.    I am 31 in January.    I desperately want a girl, i have been so depressed and down since i found out it was a boy.    I dont know what I would do if I never got a girl.    So I was wondering for my second baby when that time comes, if i take clomid so i know exactly when i am ovulating as my ovulation is all over the place & always has been so I never knew when to have sex to concieve(conceive).    And so then I can plan to concieve(conceive)3 days before ovulation (& then i will actually know when this is) in the hope of the boy sperm dieing off and concieving a girl.    Do you think that this would work?    Is it really bad to take clomid over a period of time??    Anything else I should do to get that girl???"
