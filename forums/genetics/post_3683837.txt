"I usually have my periods approximately 2 or 3 days earlier than the last one. It was due around the 10.-14. of November 2008 (In October it came on the 15.). On Friday November 14/08 I needed to have X-rays of my pelvic,lumbar region because I'd been experiencing severe back pain that week and wanted to find out what was wrong.    The x-ray technician asked me prior to the x-rays if when the last time was that I'd had my period and realized it was so close to when it was due again. I told her that I didn't have my period right before my x-rays.So she went ahead and did them. I still haven't had my period and it's Thursday November 20. it's a week over do and there's no chance of my being pregnant. Should I see my doctor? What could be wrong with me? Why is it so delayed?"
