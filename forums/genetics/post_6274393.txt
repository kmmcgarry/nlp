"My friend is concerned her Grandpa might have Alzheimers. He is 75, turning 76 in December.He's had bad mood swings, and his memory has slowly deteriorated. Just recently, about a week or so ago, her Grandpa put something in the toaster oven and cranked it up to it's highest heat. He walked away from it and soon the food was inflames. Her and her Grandma had to put the fire out, and her Grandpa had completely forgotten he put anything in there.Now this is what scared her. Her Grandmas bday was yesterday, and the day before that her Grandpa was going to make a big poster board card for her Grandma.    Her Grandpa forgot that one of his daughters had two baby girls, and said she had two baby boys. My friend had to constantly ask him if he remembered, and he had a confused look on his face and kept saying \"no she has two boys\". Finally, after awhile of my friend saying it was two girls, he goes \"Ohhh right\" and even forgot their names. Here's the worst part, her Grandpa forgot her own name [my friends]. She was shocked, but tried not to show it, and asked \"Grandpa are you serious? Did you forget my name?\" and asked him to write it down to see if he remembered. He struggled and couldn't remember, as soon as she told him he goes \"Ohhh that's right\". He also forgot her brothers name.In the past he has forgotten what day it is, several times. Also he forgot when my friends birthday was. Her Grandpa's sister had Alzheimers and passed away from it. Im pretty sure someone else in his family had it too. I know it's hereditary. But what should she do?"
