"Hi I am sharing my story in this forum to see if I can get some help    as no one really knows why this is happening or what is happening. I miscarried last year in October at around 8 weeks after seeing no heart beat. Then I had one bio chemical pregnancy this year in June. I conceived again in November, my hcg levels were almost 10,000 at 4 weeks. We had our first scan at 6 weeks and could see the heart beat at 103 bpm, the technician said its low. Also, one of her observations was that the gestational sac is bigger than yolk sac by 2 weeks and is measuring 8 weeks. We did a follow up at 8 weeks and discovered that the heart beat dropped to 74 bpm and embryo was still measuring only 6 weeks which meant the growth stopped. My doc asked me to take hcg shot, start progesterone tablets, aspirin and also continue my frolic acid which I have been taking. She asked us to do a follow up in a week,s time which was on Dec 31. We went for a follow scan and found that the heart beat went up to 106 which I know is very low for 9 weeks and the embryo size corresponds to 6 weeks which mean no growth for last 3 weeks. Also, they saw 2 sacs this time and the technician said this is not normal so heart rate 106 bpm, 2 yolk sac like structures and 1 heart beat with no growth.they have asked us to wait for 10 more days and then go for D & C. I was really hopeful this time :-( last time also they could see 2 sac like structure out of that one was the yolk sac , no one knows about the other.My doc doubts if it has to do with some genetic abnormality. I am really puzzled as no one gives a clear answer and we have consulted 3 docs by nowPlease help if you have had any such experience or have heard of similar cases. I can share my sonography report if neededAny help would be appreciated"
