"I asked this question a few weeks ago and no responded so I will ask again.Is it possible through ones behavior(drinkings/alcoholism)to initiate a genetic propensity in ones bloodline(children,grandchildren etc.) for alcoholism when it never existed geneticly before?And I mean stricktly genetic not related to an environment of drinking.For example if the child grew up in another family would this now be a genetic propensity that would follow them anywhere?"
