"I want to know if anyone else knows of any Gulf War (the 1st one) Veteran who has Progressive Dementia and Cerebral Atrophy.    My husband turns 40 on 10/16.. he also has had a a mini stroke, possible while I was in Australia recently to get my daughter.Our local VA has a great Neurologist we see, but her hands are tied by the system.    We really need a PET scan to see more.I see we have people from the Cleveland Clinic on here.. anyone willing to take up his case?It is so sad to see my young husband going through this.Any advice et is extremely welcome."
