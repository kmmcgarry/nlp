"My father is in the final stages of dementia. He can no longer hold anything or walk. He quit speaking about 4 years ago. I just was recently told that he no longer chews. This has been for about 6 weeks. His food is thickened so he can swallow it. He has lost about 20 pounds in 5 months. His albumin level is 2.7, and 2.5 is sometimes the criteria for hospice care. My question is, how much longer before he loses his ability to swallow? He has aspirated a few times, but no pneumonia, even though there is fluid in his lungs. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me, any time guidelines, though I know each case is different. I have children and a very stressful job and live far away, and it is hard to be there until close to his death. Thank you all so much."
