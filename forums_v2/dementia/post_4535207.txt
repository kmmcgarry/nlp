"My mother is in end stage dementia, is bedridden and has renal failure and double incontinence,    she has had dementia for about 6 years and has gone downhill rapidly this year having just come out of hospital being she had malnutrition due to not realising she had to eat.    She is 87 years old and is being assessed for a care home place.    I would like to know what is the possible life expectancy for her - would it be better to die in her own home, rather than be shifted out to a care home for assessment and then on somewhere else after that.    What is the likelihood of her living much longer.    I wish she could pass away peacefully at home."
