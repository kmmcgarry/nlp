"My sister in law had a heart surgery a month ago.Recovering was connected to severe complications (lung infection becouse of ventilation,inability of breathing.. )so she was under the anestesia about 25 days.Immediately after waking strange things were happening such as seeing people that were not there,talking about events that were not happened.We thought that was teporarily but it has been    about 20 days she is awoken but can not remember past events,she did not know    reason she was in the hospital (we told her),forgot we visited her there,she thought her older sister was dead,convinced something has happened that is not true.....Could you, please, tell me what is happening to her.We are affraid of dementia."
