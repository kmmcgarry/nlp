"My father is 93 years old.    Fell and was hospitalized.    Hospital gave him Seroquel 12.5 mg, morning and night to control his agitation and supposedly reduce his delusions and paranoia.    (He also suffers from very occasional halucinations.)    When he released home, his aggressive behavior ramped up, since he is so weak he cannot get himself out of bed which angers him.    The doctor upped the Seroquel to 25 mg at night.    He's now been this medication 1 week, and the last 4 days at 25 mg at night (plus 12.5 mg during the day).    He appears to be more confused and having more hallucinations, so it doesn't appear to be working.    On top of that, I've researched this drug and see it is contraindicated for treating people with dementia.    Essentially, what we want is a drug to give him at bed time that will help keep him calm and help him sleep so he doesn't try to climb out of his hospital bed (now in the home) causing another fall.    What would be suggested for this purpose with the least possible side effects.    Also, very occasionally he becomes agitated during the day due to some bizzare thought in his head.    When this occurs, what would be suggested for an \"as needed\" medication."
