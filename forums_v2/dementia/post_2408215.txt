"Hello....One neuropsychologist tested my mother and says dementia another tested her 2 months later and said MCI...mild cognitive impairment. Her internist did a MMSE and the score was 28. What could be going on here? If she can name 25 animals in a category    it should not be dementia according to the MERK manual. Could medications or stress be involved?"
