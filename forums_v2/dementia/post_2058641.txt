"Hello: In September 2005 I suffered a massive brain hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke. I underwent two brain surgeries: one to clip two ruptured aneurysms and one to install a permanent shunt to remove blood and cerebro-spinal fluid from my intracranial cavity. While I have experienced some recovery in some areas, MY SHORT-TERM MEMORY and sequencing abilities are severely diminished.I have been recently tested for Vascular Dementia by neuropsychologists at the local Medial Center (UC Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, CA). The results have not yet been provided to me; however, I expect to receive a DX at the end of the month.What options (pharmaceutical or otherwise) are normally employed to treat vascular dementia? Thank You So Much! I feel that my memory is growing steadily worse and am quite worried. Any information will be appreciated.BRAIN2005"
