"I am looking for information on dementia and surgery. My dad needs knee replacement surgery but he was recently diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. I'm in Kathmandu, Nepal (3rd world country) and most doctors cannot tell me how it may affect my dad. Went to a neurologist and he says go ahead with knee replacement surgery since it might increase his quality of life. But he says dementia might get worse because of the stress from surgery and might be permanent but that's the risk. I don't know if the risk is worth taking. Right now, his memory has gone downhill but the most drastic thing is his speech. He cannot communicate well; has difficulty finding the right words to form a sentence. He recognizes people and the condition is still bearable. I don't want to put my dad at risk but he cannot walk because of the weakness (advanced arthritis). He is not in pain, he says. He is taking neurocetam 800mg, 3 times a day as prescribed my the neurologist but he says he might only improve a little bit. I know no one can tell me exactly what the best option is but any advise will be appreciated. Thank you...Junkirri***@****"
