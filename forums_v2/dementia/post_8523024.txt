"My wife has HM and is having migraine attacks 7 to 8 times each day. Sometimes these attacks cause memory loss. She can't remember what we watched on TV the night before or several days before. She sometimes doesn't people who have been around her on a daily basis. On a recent ER visit, I ask the doctor about this. He said that the memory loss is not caused by the migraine, but offered no advice on what to do. What kind of doctor does she need to see to have this checked out? need help."
