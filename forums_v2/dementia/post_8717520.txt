"My brother who has dementia lives with my sister who is his carer. However she does not give him his daily statin as she read in a newspaper that statins cause memory loss. She said his dr agreed he could stop taking them.I have been looking after him this last week and noticed that the statins are still on his repeat prescription.As well as Dementia he has a heart condition."
