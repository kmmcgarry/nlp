"My mother-in-law is a very active 66 years old.    She had a particularly busy and stressful past year along with a number of funerals of close relatives.    Up until Xmas she seemed like her usual self with the exception of seeming more opinionated.    Within the last 4 weeks she has lost most of her short term memory and some of her long term memory.    The other day my wife phoned to say hello and was not reconized, (this seems really odd to me as my wife and my sister-in-law are twins and no one can tell them apart when they are on the phone).    My sister-in-law has taken her to a psychiatrist, a doctor, and had a CAT scan done.    The diagnosis is that it is the onset of a form of dementia and unlikely to improve.    One problem I have is that besides being 3000 miles away, my sister-in-law is close to being a hypochondriac and had numerous real or imaginary problems.Is it normal or likely for this type of regression to happen in 4 weeks?Could a memory loss be triggered by excessive mental stress?"
