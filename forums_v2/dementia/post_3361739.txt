"I have a 65 year old grandma that is having siezures with auras and has memory loss. However she is aware of her memory loss. Leading me to think she may have vascular dementia that is affect a part of the brain and triggering the siezures and memory loss. None of her doctors have been able to tell her what is wrong. Currently they have her on medication that is making her loose weight. The memory loss usually follows a siezure and sometimes she shows no sign of a siezure but has an aura. Is it more important to control the siezure. or focus on the memory loss?"
