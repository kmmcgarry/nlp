"Hi all.I'm 28 yo. I have been diagnosed with GAD, stress disorder, and depersonalization/derealization including mild depression and other smaller problems such as OCD and phobias. I have been on medications for at least 12 years and currently taking effexor and klonopin. I had a severe emotional trauma when I was 12 but I didn't develop PTSD.For the past 4 years my memory has been getting worse, so has my depersonalization and derealization.I have to think hard what I did yesterday or day before. I am also forgetful. I had 2 brain scans in the past and 1 was just a year ago.what scared me the most is when someone mentioned an event that happened a few months ago and I cannot remember it at all. It did happen but I cannot picture it.I live with this brain fog daily and is hard to function but I fear it could be dementia.Any ideas?PS. Klonopin seems to help for stress and anxiety and now I even can work but not being able to recall this event scares the hell out of me."
