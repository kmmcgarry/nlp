"My mum has a stint in the opening of the pancreas to stop it closing off, this has been caused through rispererdone and quetiapine.    Mum is now suffering pain in the lower left side of her back and is bleeding intermittenly from the bowel. There are also a number of tablets involved now as MUM HAD A NEAR FATAL REACTION TO QUETIANE and went into heart defib also increasing her dementia from mild to moderate. Up until then my mother had not been on tablets for any length of time and was very fit.Should I be looking at the tablets, the stint, or something more serious. Regards Trish"
