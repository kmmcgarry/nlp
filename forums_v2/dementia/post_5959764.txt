"My Mother, an 82 yo DM2, has had an MRI, DX small vessel dementia.    She has declined over the last decade.    She doesn't recognize her children, short term memory is < 3 min.    She is anxious and fearful.    If we stop her meds; Metoprolol, statin, Advandia, Glibizide, what would happen?    We don,t want her to have pain but she is unhappy & afraid 99% of the time.    She walks with a wide semi steady gait and is continent.    Lives with her daughter and can,t be left alone."
