"My husband has been taking 10mg of Aricept for 2 years now and I have not noticed any significant difference in his memory.    Actually, my observation is his memory is becoming worse.    I'm struggling with whether I should discontinue the medication since I don't see improvement and because it is quite costly.     I also know Aricept is designed to slow down the dementia so if I discontinue it I'm wondering if he will become worse much faster.    Is there any other medication out there that may work better and cost less?Thank youTrinity"
