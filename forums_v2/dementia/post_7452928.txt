"Hi, folks--Dad (now 86) diagnosed with probable vascular dementia 2 years ago this coming Feb. He's had 2 strokes the past 9 months (one major, one small); right CVAs. We've suspected for many years that he has bipolar disease and personality disorder, though these have not been confirmed (just started seeing psych person w/in past couple months, and given the whole picture, ferreting out what's what has not been feasible.) My Dad has never been one to really cooperate w/ family, now it's worse. He's in assisted living now; looks like I may have to go for guardianship due to increased behavior problems and his having no understanding of his abilities/challenges/need for assistance. Had    hoped to avoid legal action because he's so nasty already.In his \"healthy\" years, he frequently sued people, often far-fetched and found to be w/o merit. Dread this. Any suggestions from people that have been through similar situations would be really helpful--things you'd do differently if you knew what you know now? I have 2 sisters and they are not much help, sometimes more hindrance than just non-participatory. Thanks for any help you can provide!"
