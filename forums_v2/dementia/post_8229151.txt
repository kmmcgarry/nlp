"Hi! I am in the process of having more tests done, but it seems my docs don't even know which direction to LOOK. One doc gave me 10 different \"guesses\" as to what she thought the cause of my memory loss/confusion is.    I am a 35yr old female, w/ history of migraine w/ aura & several episodes of \"complicated migraine\". 2-3 months ago, I had an episode that they can only assume was a complicated migraine (MRI & EEGs were normal). The severity of the episode improved over 24-48hrs (I had gotten lost while driving around, in a familiar place, couldn't remember how to use my phone to get help, & was confused by everything...signs, words, conversations, etc)...except some memory loss & confusion. I have a hard time with timelines, what seems like happened 2-3 wks ago, I am told happened only a day ago. I can only remember bits & pieces of things, & what I DO remember, seems like it happened several weeks ago (like trying to recall a dream that you only vaguely remember). My thoughts get \"jumbled up\" & I don't know what's what sometimes (makes me wonder if it's an actual complicated migraine when that happens). But I don't know if complicated migraines can leave you with ongoing memory loss & confusion like this. I can't \"hold on\" to information for more than a few seconds before I have to get the info again. I usually can't recall the things I've done earlier in the day...like my brain is just not making a memory of it.The neurologist I saw after my ER visit told me it could be a vitamin B-12 deficiency (and advised I started taking a B-complex vitamin...which I have been taking every day since then), she also suggested it could be hypothryoidism (which my mom has, & my tests last year were normal...but I plan to ask for a re-test), she also suggested a sleep disorder (but I've had trouble falling asleep since I was a kid, & nothing has changed). My doc is on the verge of calling this an early-onset form of dementia... I am even exploring psychiatric causes (schizophrenia) but I have no family history of that. I just want to know which direction to go in, & hope that it's something that can be TREATED.I know you can't diagnose on here, I was just hoping for some insight & medical opinions on what possibilities can cause this, b/c right now my docs seems stumped (and so do I), & I haven't yet seen the 2nd neuro (who I hope doesn't play pin-the-tail-on-the-patient w/ her diagnoses like the last one). :)Thank you for ANY insight/opinions you can share!~Kim"
