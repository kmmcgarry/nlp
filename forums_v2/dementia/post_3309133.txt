"Hi I have had undiagnosed neurological problems for two years. I am thirty two years old and suffer from neurological problems such as dementia, muscle wasting, peripheral neuropathy, there are two sisters that have celiacs and two nephews with it. I am concerned about my son if he is gluten sensitive he could develop the same issues as me so I want to have genetic testing done for this. From what I understand people who develop the neurological problems and disease from gluten often do not have problems with the bowel. Anyways my question is would I need to have the genetic testing done or both of us. I am concerned about my health but my main concern for the testing is the future health of my son."
