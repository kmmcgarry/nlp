"My mom is 57 and has just been diagnosed with absence seizures.    Over the last two years she has also been experiencing some memory loss.    She has been attributing the memory issues to menopause.    However, in the last couple of months, she has become more concerned about her memory, due to more episodes of \"fogginess\", forgetting names, situations etc.    This has led to increased anxiety and worry.    She is just awaiting her next appointment with her neurologist.    I have been trying to do some research regarding the link between adult onset epilepsy and dementia.    Is there a link?    Is it possible that the memory issues are being compounded by her anxiety about them, or could they be related to menopause?As you can imagine, we are very concerned, especially since she is very young to be having these kinds of symptoms."
