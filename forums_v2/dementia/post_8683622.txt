"My father in law has dementia. His doc has him on xanax to help him sleep at night (to try to keep the reversal from happening, which happened with my MIL). He seems to have developed a resistance to the dose already - it has only been a couple of months so he is calling people in the middle of the night to chat causing us to have to run over there in the middle of the night to check on him.    Any luck with melatonin or other things to help?He wants to stay at home but cannot afford 24hr care so he is left alone at night after he is put to bed. He is told to stay in bed (he has O2 and depends and pads so he does not have to get up) but he still gets up.He is seeing the doc in a couple of days anyway - just wondered if anyone had any ideas?"
