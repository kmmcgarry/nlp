"WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GRANDMOTHER IS SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA.IN THE LAST 4 YEARS - SHE HAS GRADUALLY BECOME MORE AND MORE HATEFUL TO OUR GRANDFATHER.    THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED OVER 60 YEARS NOW SHE IS ACCUSING HIM OF HAVING MARRIAGE AFFAIRS, OF NOT LOVING HER , OF NOT HAVING ANY FAMILY .PLEASE NOTE THAT GRAMPS LOVES HER , TAKES CARE OF HER, MAKES HER MORNING COFFEE(WHICH NOW AFTER ALL THESE YEARS SHE WILL NOT DRINK BECAUSE SHE \"DOESN'T WANT ANYTHING FROM HIM\" .    SHE HAS 7 KIDS AND DOZEN OF GRANDCHILDREN.    BUT EACH DAY SHE SEEMS MORE AND MORE LIKE SOMEONE WE DON'T KNOW.    SHE WILL NOT ALLOW US TO TAKE HER TO A PSYCHOLOGIST .    SHE'S ALWAYS ANGRY AT GRAMPS.    SOMETIMES SHE LEAVES THE BEDROOM AND SLEEP IN THE LIVING ROOM ON THE SOFA.    WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH. SHE WON'T GO SPEAK TO THE PASTOR. SINCE THE DAY SHE AND GRAMPS GOT MARRIED THEY PRAYED EVERY NIGHT TOGETHER IN THE BEDROOM NOW SHE REFUSES.SHE IS SUFFERING BUT SHE IS ALSO TAKING THE WIND OUT OF GRAMPS.    HE CRYS, HE FEELS SO SAD FOR WHAT SHE IS BECOMING. WHAT DO WE DO? WHO DO WE NEED TO SEE? CAN SHE TAKE MEDICATION?"
