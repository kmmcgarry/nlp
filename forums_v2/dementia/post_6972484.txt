"I an 27 and I was diagnosed homozygous for A1298C MTHFR mutation. The articles that I have read online are all very vague. I know that my pregnancy losses are attributed to this, but the more I read the more I see red flags that pop up in my family's medical history. My mother has had a stroke, my grandmother had dementia and schitsophrenia, my aunt had leukemia. I am wondering if it is all connected. To go a bit further down the rabbit hole....I read about the posibility of this increasing the risks for spina bifida, I was born    with my intestines on the outside....have there ever been any tests or research that might    link that as well?    I want to know more! Please help."
