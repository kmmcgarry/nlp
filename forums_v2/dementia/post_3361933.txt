"I am a psychology assistant working with people with learning disabilities and Dementia.We are currently using an assessment tool called the Dementia questionnairre for people with Learning Disabilities (DLD), but I would like to start using the CAMDEX-DS.    Does anyone know whether there are scoring criteria for the CAMDEX? As we have bought the tool but cannot find anything on how to decide whether the change in scores over time is significant.    Thanks for any help,Faye."
