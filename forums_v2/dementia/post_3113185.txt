"My mom was diagnosed with dementia about 8 months ago.    Something happened yesterday that has scared me.    The neighbor had cleaned her flower garden and had pulled some that were dead and they were lying on the ground.    My mom told me that she was the one that had pulled the flowers.    There is a chain link fence between the properties so there is no way she could have even gone into the neighbor√¢ Ä ôs lawn.    Also, we had been cleaning out mom√¢ Ä ôs lawn about a month ago.    Do you think she may be thinking of that time or is she delusional or hallucinating?    Thank You"
