"My mom been diagnosed with dementia 1 year ago. She's on Aricipt & Namada - and hasn't had any problems with the meds (on them for the year).She's lately been sleeping most of the day. She gets up, has coffee, then goes back to bed and can sleep until almost dinner time. Is she going into the advanced stage? What can we expect?"
