"2 years ago at the age of 42 I had a heart procedure done where my heart stopped 3 times and I suffered nerve damage throughout my body and what my dr thinks was oxygen loss and mild brain damage. I also have moderate obstructive sleep apnea and have loss of oxgen which I think makes the problem worse.Could that brain damage and oxygen deprivation cause dementia/alzeheimers? how do I tell?the past 2 years I've gone through periods of complete memory loss issues, forgetfulness, and \"brain freezes\" that leave me completely stumped...at first after surgery, I noticed little things wrong with my memory like not remembering my older children were from my first marriage or that I had been married before but the dr said that might be due to PTSD and the memories may come back.for example I know what words; are but forget what they mean or mix words up; like last week in my dr's office I told him I would sit in the table instead of chair; when I know full well what a table & chair are for and didn't even notice I said I would sit in a table until the dr looked at me weird and questioned me.another thing is when someone jokes as my husband often does, I don't know what it means any more and have to ask him to explain it all to me...I have problems sometimes even remembering my children's birthdays or how old they are...that should be easy, and I thought my husband and I had met when we were teens yet we didn't know each other or live in the same city and didn't meet until he was 29.I was shocked to find when I had a psych eval last month that I could not subtract numbers as I used to no matter how much I tried I only got 1 number right -    I mean 3rd grade math stuff subtracting 7 from 100 I got; but then i couldn't even remember what that number was or how to subtract 7 from that sum.In the past 2 years, I've had a ton of tests done to try and figure out what's going on healthwise.    The only thing besides electriacl issues with my heart; is I have inflammation throughout my body they can't find a cause of and I've had just about every blood test there is to check for most possible problems.any ideas?"
