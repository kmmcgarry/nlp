"I have dementia that has been determined to be of neurological origin but not progressive. It can cause episodes of cognitive confusion and memory loss that can be of concern. Last night I had to change the Catapres application I am prescribed but I forgot to remove the old application until the morning which is unsafe. Sometimes I forget to keep track of when I am cooking and things like that.I applied for a home atttendant a while back but was not found to be eligible. I have discussed potential treatments with my neurologists who are following up. They agree that I should remain where I live in the community which is what I want as well. What I am asking about and even a few tips would help is some is some pragmatic ideas on how to deal with episodes of memory loss and cognitive confusion and how to prevent any errors in judgement they might cause. Thanks."
