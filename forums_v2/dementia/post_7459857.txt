"My mother who is 70, has been diagnosed with a Vascular Dementia Condition. This is further complicated by depression. She is on treatment for depression, asprin and a statin.I always thought Dementia was a slow progressing condition.But it appears that over the last few months the condition just seems to get that little bit worse week by week.The Dr said that sometimes there is a run of tine wee strokes and then things may plateou out for a while, however, we are a year down the line and this has not happened.I am a person that kidn of looks at worst case scenario and best case scenario and work somewhere inbetween, however, I cannot find much on what type of prognosis could occur.Any advise gratefully received"
