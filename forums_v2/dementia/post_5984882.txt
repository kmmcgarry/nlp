"I am signing up to discuss my father's health.    He is 85 and I recently moved him to an Assisted Living Facility.    I like the place and I visit regularly but although my father was already diagnosed with Dementia, I see him more withdrawn as time passes by and this progressed rapidly after I moved him to the ALF.I noticed that he is taking Sequerol and recently needed to have oxygen because his oxygen level was low.    He is also diabetic and receives insulin shots twice a day.    Aside from his other medications, he was taking Aricept before and now is he Sequerol.    I am concerned about Sequerol since I don't think my dad is bipolar or has schizophrenia.    How damaging can Sequerol be?    Is it better to continue with his Aricept to go along with the Namenda.    Other medications are Lipitor, Metformin.. and I'll double check on add'l. ones.Thank You"
