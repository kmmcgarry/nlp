"Hey, My grandmother is    84 years old and for about 5 years ago she has been diagnosed with dementia. Shes taking some kind of anxiety/ depression medicine for it. She would have little panic attack here and there, and we use to be able to get her to realize she is fine. Recently my aunt took over pills because my grandma thinks me and my mom do to much, its been about maybe 4 months since they have been in control of her and my grandpa's pills, they bring them when ever they feel like it and don't make sure they take them and you can see they don't care, But in the past months they have been taking care of my grandmother I have noticed shes more aggravated and more aggressive and shes a lot more upset and starts seeing people and having made up conversations in her mind and she worries to the point of panic and ended up in the hospital. I cant tell if maybe shes just getting worse of if maybe her meds aren't being regulated like they should be? I was just wondering if anyone knew is she just getting worse or could they possibly be neglecting my grandmother? They live alone,in the house I grew up in its on like a farm, and my grandpa is handicap in a wheel chair and has MS. Me and my mom are maybe 5 minutes at the least away from the house. So were really just a phone call away, but maybe its time for more help? Any answers are welcome.... Thank you."
