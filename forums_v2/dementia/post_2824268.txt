"Hi,I hope someone can give me an answer soon. 10/07/08 I had a Cat Scan done because I was concerned about my memory and not being a sharp as I was.It showed mild bifrontal atrophy and everything else appeared normal.    I have severe neck problems so at first I thought it had to do with various medications I am on. Saw a new Dr. for depression and my memory problems came up and he wanted to have a MRI with and w/o contrast which I did. My follow up visit had to be postponed so I got the report.    Most of it was normal, except under findings -noncontrast images reveal a few scattered areas of high signal change in the periventricular deep white matter bilaterally. Under Impression - a few scattered small vessel ischemic change foci demonstrated in the periventricular deep white matter.Does anyone know what this means in laymen terms and does it have anything to do with dementia?    I am so stressed out.    Please can someone help and try and answer this?Thanks so much"
