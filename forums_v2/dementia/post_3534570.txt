"Today i heard about the drug Remba, which sounds like a promising antidote, reversing memory loss etc.Someone in this forum mentioned that we can find this drug on the web.I have not been succesful in my search.I know it is either on research stages, or possibly in use in England.My mom suffers from this lewy body dementia, and i wish there was something more effective out there other thanaricept or exelon...If anyone knows anything about REMBA, please drop me a line....I thank you andgood luck to you ,or your loved one!Vanna7"
