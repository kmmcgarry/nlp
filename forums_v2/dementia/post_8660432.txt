"Hello. Well my grandad has had dementia for over 7 years now, and he is in a nursing home. Being a teenager it was quite difficult for me to cope at home, with the chaos between him and my grandma and mum. He started getting violent and thats when we decided enough was enough. And that he had to go in to the nursing home then because it was getting just too much. That was over 1 year ago. So anyway, instead of telling you a story, all i want to really ask is (if anyone knows...), around about how long might my grandad have till he may pass away. I mean he is now lying in a bed unable to move properly. Isnt able to walk, and sometimes is almost unresponsive (verbally). He is able to talk a bit, crackinga few jokes every now and then, but there are other times where he just stared at the wall and says nothing. How long might he have left?"
