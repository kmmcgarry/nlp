"Hello, my Mom and I live with and have been taking care of my Grandma who has dementia. She sleeps most of the day sitting in a recliner and often she wakes up completely startled and begins crying eventually.    She usually thinks someone told her she was bad and is being kicked out of her house but can't remember what she did. (No one has told her anything like this ) or she is thinking about her parents or sister who has passed away,    or she is worried that the animals are going to starve to death. Anyway,    when she thinks negatively it is accompanied by a constant feeling of being extremely cold (even when the house is roasting and she has a hot water bottle and blankets covering her),also she will start saying 'Ouch! Ouch!' and touching her fingertips saying that it feels like something is biting her or like electric shocks. Sometimes it is even going down her arms and in her armpits. My question is is this something that is related to the dementia? Is it normal or something else?    We have wondered sometimes if it is a heart problem but the doctors have looked at her arteries and seem to think everything is fine. Also electric shock is usually nerve related isn't it?"
