"My father is 82. He has had dementia for about 10 years. He hasn't spoken a word for about 4 years, yet he will holler out or moan at times. He quit walking about 6 months ago, and can no longer hold anything, except his cup to drink. He usually eats all of his meals. He sleeps about 12+ hours in a 24 hour period. He has had episodes of projectile vomiting and diahhrea. He has that blank stare. He is definitely in stage 7 and has been for about 3 years. His albumin is a bit low. How much longer can he live?"
