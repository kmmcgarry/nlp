"My Grandmother has some form of dementia and I don't really know what the right way of handeling some of her behaviors. One thing that seems to be a constant is that she seems happy to be angry-nothing is ever right.I try to find the \"silver lining\" but she will have none of it.She is very paranoid-everyone is whispering about her-& lately she is very demanding.This morning she phoned me @7:30 and wanted laundry soap and when I said I would get her some later she said \"forget it!'& hung up on me.She would have me running all day everyday &still find more things for me to do. She feels like she has no problems with her memory & I am the one who is \"out to lunch\" I know this is the disease talking but I'm getting frustrated none the less.Could someone please give me some helpful hints? Thanks so much for your time in advance!"
