"Phenytoin toxicity seems to share many symtoms(symptoms)with vascular dementia - slurred speech, unsteadiness, cognitive impairment.    Without a blood test to check for the unbound level of phenytoin, is there any symptons that are specific in one disorder and absolutely not in the other?Many thanks"
