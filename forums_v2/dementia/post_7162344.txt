"Hi.once again! I am going crazy dealing with my grandmother who has some form of dementia. She has been telling stories that are way out there & while I realize this is part of the disease I am trying to keep these stories under control so she doesn't tell them to other people.She is 87 yrs. old & refuses to have anyone live with her or to go into a home.She feels that there is nothing wrong with her even though home care comes in daily to give her Aricept-that is the norm to her.She doesn't bath,although she swears up and down she does & just her overall ability to take care of herself is gone.I have power of attorney & take care    of her bills, grocery shopping & such but on occasion she goes to the bank by taxi or whoever will take her & takes out stupid amounts of money which slowly disappears & then she tells others that I am stealing money from her. I'm sorry that this is all over the place but I am just about at whits end & I don't know what else to do or where or how to do it.Does anyone have any suggestions? Does it HAVE to go before the courts to be able to do anything?    Thanks for reading my rambelings & your time!         \"P\""
