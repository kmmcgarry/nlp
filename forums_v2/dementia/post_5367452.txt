"Hi,    I am Hypothyroid and went undiagnosed for years.    8 years after I found out, I was also diagnosed with a pituitary tumor, which has since been removed.    I have short-term memory loss, have extreme difficulty remembering names and faces and constantly loosing my keys and other items.    I have noticed I get aggitated easy and have become less socialble. I don't like to be around people anymore. Sometimes when I talk, the words in my mind do not come out of my mouth the way I am thinking of them.    My cognative abilities have decreased a lot.    Although, I do make jokes about all this to my friends and people I meet,    but I am really starting to think I have this.I have MS that runs in the family and I am also currently being evaluated for that too.For years many of my doctors believed i was just a hypochondriac, but I proved them wrong.    Trying to recall indcidents and conversations are nearly impossible and everyone just looks at me like I am lying or pretending and it is driving me nuts.Can a 41 year old woman get Dementia?"
