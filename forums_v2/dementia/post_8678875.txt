"My 78 year old father was diagnosed with dimentia(dementia)about 5 years ago. Finding that there are good days and bad days with this disease. Last night my father was speaking with my sister in CA (we live in MI) and she was talking about her boyfriend of 25 years and my father emphatically believed that he was simply her landlord and not her boyfriend and even had trouble remembering his name. My father lives alone in a house about 40 minutes away from me.My father has always been a rational and logical person. Watching this deterioration is heart-breaking. Anyways brought this issue up and asked him what he expected me to do with this information since he is always in denial about things like this. He told me that he knows he is having a \"little\" trouble and instructed me not to do anything and that he will let me know when it is time for me to step in and help. I told him that I am worried that he may be out driving one day and forget what yield means or what a red light means and that he may injure himself or someone else. That didn't seem to phase him.Guess I am looking for advice. Don't want to forcibly put him in any home. We've toured Assisted Living facilities, and as nice as they are nowadays, in his mind they are just dressed up final resting place before death. I won't force him into any place like that unless the care he would require is beyond my ability.Thank you to all for any advice.Laurie"
