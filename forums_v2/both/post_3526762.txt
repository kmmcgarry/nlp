"MCI is the dx given to my husband by the Neuropsychologist. She also mentioned Chronic ischemic microvascular disease. I have NO idea what that means, unless it means small blood vessels in his brain are shutting down.My questions are overwhelming and I cannot ask my husband's neurologist because He [my husband] is very sensitive about the terms dementia and Alzheimer's.i read that most MCI patients go on to have an Alzheimer's dx within 5 yrs. Is this TRUE?I am really new to all this and having a hard time digesting and accepting all this.Thanks for any help you have to give."
