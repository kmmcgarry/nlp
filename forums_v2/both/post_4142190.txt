"My wife has been diagnosed to be at the early stage of Alzheimers or Dementia. She is on medication (Arizept and many other suggested vitamins).She is loosing weight rapidly, has no interest in things (except great Granchildren).She sleeps during the night and most of the day if I do not take her for a ride. She refuses to walk with me,and do the usual things we used to do together.(She will do laundy almost daily however.)My question is:How can I stimulate her inerest to become mentally more active? She was been given several books to read, but does not seem to be interested in reading other than the daily flyes and ads. Her excuse is her macular degeneration (One eye).I am desperately trying to help her, but do not know how to approach the probles as she seems to resent suggestions I make based on literature I read on the subject.Thank you."
