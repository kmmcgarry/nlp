"I am 41 years old and have brain damage and dementia due to an overdose in 2003. I have 2 MRI's over the years .. one just recent. Both show I have 4 white spots and haven't changed over the years but want to keep an eye on them. I was wondering if they are caused by brain damage and dementia.Also, they assume I will develope Alzheimer's, as Dad had it at young age. Would an MRI show Alzheimer's. I live in Canada and that is the only best available technology they can do. I am on maximum aricept now and have short term memory loss still and can no longer calculate.Just wondering if they will ever know besides autopsy if and when I have full blown Alzheimers with MRI."
