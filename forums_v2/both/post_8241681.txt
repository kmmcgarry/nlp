"My elderly mother has Alzheimer's Disease, she is 87, and recently developed elevated Liver Enzymes. Her geriatrician stopped all her meds including those for Alzheimers to stabilize her liver. Once her Liver stabilized, the doctor introduced Risperdal stating that it is less liver antagonistic.I have read much about Risperdal being fatal to the    elderly but I have also read that given in low doses it is quite effective. My mother is currently in the hospital now for a week, and the Psychiatrist has increased the dose to 2 mg a day. He tells me that this is a low dose but I keep obsessing over the mortality issue. Aside from the Dementia, my mother is in decent health except for COPD, and does not require oxygen.Could someone shed some light on this subject, and the dosage, as it has created much anxiety for me despite her beginning to positively respond."
