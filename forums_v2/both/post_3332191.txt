"My father is 51 years old and I am moving to be with him.    I am 23 years old and am unsure what to expect.    My father will not share any information but just wants me there.    From what I gather from my sister he has dementia caused by mini strokes he has been having for most of his life unnoticed.    I can't seem to find any information on this disease without it being linked with Alzheimers.    He does not have that so I don't know what to expect.    I have some experience with working with autistic behavioral children and caring for adults with polio but am unsure what to look foward to. Can someone please help me... either by answering these questions or sending me a link that can give me more detailed information. Also I hear that people that young live with dementia, not die from it so how bad is it going to get?    My father is healthy all around other than this. Please help anyone who can"
