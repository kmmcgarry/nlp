"My mother started showing signs of dementia when she was in her mid 50's.    No one in Mom's family had these type of symptoms at a young age. In fact, most lived into their 80's and 90's and were still living alone.    Because of that I wasn't convinced she had Alzheimers.    A relative told me about Picks.    He said it was caused by stress or abuse.    My mother was verbally and emotionally abused by my father their entire marriage. I could understand closing her mind to get away from him.I guess my questions are...Is this a true statement regarding Picks?Are Alzheimers or Picks inheirited?    (Sorry, I know that's spelled wrong)I'm getting close to the age my mother was when she first started exhibiting symptoms and am scared to death.    Every time I misplace my keys or forget someones name I panic, thinking that I'm getting one disease or the other.Can anyone help?    Mom passed away in February after suffering with this for over 20 years.    I need to know if I'm going to be imprisoned like Mom was.Thanks!Goldiebear"
