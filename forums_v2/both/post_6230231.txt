"My brother is 40 yrs old and was told that he has brain shrinkage. They say that he has dementia. His conditiona has progressively gotten worse over the past two years. He is usually confused, he doesn't speak with complete sentances, he stutters alot and his comprehension skills are very minimal. The doctors told us that this is somthing that they usually see in 70 yr olds. They say they are not sure why this happened to him. They apologized to us and said that there is nothing that they can do for him. They also said that he won't get better and he should stay away from drugs ans alcohol becaus this will just make him worse.Thanks,ForJayThis discussion is related toBrain shrinkage or Alzheimer's."
