"Mother had been experiencing dreams, nightmares really centering on the things she fears the most - abandoment, loss of control of her money, being pushed down the stairs, etc.    These dreams were very real to her and she would then argue with her husband about why he said he wanted to do these things to her.    He, of course, knew nothing of these \"conversations and situations\" she thought were so real.    Additionally, when she focused on a subject she could not let it go until someone helped her make sense of it.    Often she has had angry outbursts over the past few years also, has been afraid of descending stairways, falling, and dark places.    Mother is in her late 90s now, but this has been going on for over 10 years.Recently she went to see a neurologist who took a blood test and ordered a brain scan.    THis doctor told her that her brain is shrinking and that she does not have Alzheimer's disease.    However, he prescribed Aricept for her to take.    It wasn't calming her down any, and she did not refil the prescription.    2 months later she had another bad dream and the doctor was notified.    He then prescribed exelon.My question:    If she does not have Alzheimer's disease, why would he prescribe either of these medicines for her?    If this is dimentia(dementia), aren't there other drugs out there for that or even drugs that have a claming effect?    From what I have read about excelon, I am not sure if it is compatible with her heart medication.A second question:    She also takes coumadin to thin her blood, and I have read that excelon could cause bleeding.    Could there be a drug interaction between these two drugs that may cause internal bleeding to occur?Thank you for your time."
