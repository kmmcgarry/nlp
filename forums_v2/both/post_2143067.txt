"My    gquestion has to do with    medication that is being administered to my stepfather with Alzheimers--he is being treated in a Geriatric Behavior Program at a hospital due to his formerresidemtial placement stating that he was aggressive.    He has been placed on Depoke, Seqoquel,Ativan    antoher antidepressent --not sure of spelling--Celexa or selexa.He has been in this program for 2 weeks--he has regressed to not feeding himself    nor is he eating--they are trying to feed him    (has never been feed--would take to resturant at least once a week) having not walking--has always walked a lotnever been placed in wheel chair until entering this facility,    he is also not as responsive--major decline--he is now having hallucinations.    I have never seen him in this level of decline--especially in 14 days.We are trying to meet with the Psychiatrist with no luck.    We have schuled a meeting for TuesdayNov 27, but have been informed that the nurse not the Dr would be there.    We are concerned thathe may not be able to do anything if this continures.    He does push away people and becomes agitated when he has to be changed (tolieting) and now that they are trying to feed him.I am looking for another facility to evaluate him,    planning to try University of North Carolina for help.Any info on medication used for aggression or irritability would    be of great help.At present:    Adivan 1 tab 3x day     Selexa    (Celexa) 20 mgDepoke 125    3xd    (not sure of dosage)Seroqual 50 mg at bedtime        25 2xdCelebrex     (has bad knee)If he gets aggressive (not sure what level ) they give him more/has also given it to him by injectionThis man has Alzheimer    or    a form of Dementia     he is not psychotic"
