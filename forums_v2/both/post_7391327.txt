"First of all my biggest fear in the world is getting Alzheimers. So with that being said here is my query.I am not a big drinker at all. Maybe 4 glasses of wine a week, 2 at a setting. I also take Celexa 20 mg and Klonopin prn, but only use that whenever I have panic (every 14 days or so) The Celexa works.    I am 64, work full time, and for the most part I think my memory is pretty good.I went to dinner with some friends after taking a Klonopin .5 mg, and had 2 glasses of Merlot. I had a lovely time, A week later, I saw a guy in the diner who said hi, and he knew me. Said he had met me that night at dinner and we chatted, I pretended to know him because I did not want to appear rude or look odd/ I did ask him where he worked and he told me and I had a vague recognition of that topic.That scared the beJesus out of me. Should I be worried? Was that a blackout from mixing the two drugs, or is this a warning sign that I could be heading for dementia. My doc never mentioned not to have a drink when taking Klonopin. There is no dementia in my family by the way."
