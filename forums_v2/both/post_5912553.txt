"My gf's mum who is 58 this year bathed multiple times this morning and everytime she came out of the bathroom, she claimed that she can't recall having already taken shower. She had similar situations like this in the past but not as bad as today. Could this be a symptom of dementia or Alzheimer's?Many thanks."
