"My mother whom is 63yrs was diagnosed with Alzheimers 2 years ago.She has developed slurred speach usually first thing on a morning.The GP says that she has not had a stroke and that it is not phlegm/chest infection but it is due to her dementia.How advanced is her Alzheimers for slurred speach to occur? and will she start to deteriorate rapidly from now on?"
