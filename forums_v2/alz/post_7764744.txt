"When my husband wakes up from sleeping, he can't seem to remember things.    For example, earlier in the day he called our mechanic about our car.    Later in the day when he woke up from a nap and I asked him what was wrong with the car, he was confused that I was asking about the car.    About 5 minutes later he remembered.    Is this normal?    He is 65.    Also, for the past 6 nights I have asked him to leave a certain pillow on the bed as it it gives me neck support at night.    Each night for the past 6 nights he has no recall that I asked him to leave the pillow on the bed.    Is this normal?"
