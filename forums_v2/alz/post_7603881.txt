"My grandpa was diagnosed with alzheimer's back in December when he was put in a nursing home after breaking his hip.I'm happy to report that, now, he's doing really good. Sometimes he thinks he's in the Old West---something he never lived, obviously, but a product of watching John Wayne movies, according to his doctor. He might be coming home by March if the physical therapy all goes well.If he gets to go home, it's going to be on us to take care of him and my grandma. She's too old to help him with the Stair Lift we had installed, or to do ALL the cooking and cleaning the way she used to. Plus, her eyes are too bad to drive. My uncle, aunt, parents, and myself (16 year old girl) are going to be helping out instead.I was wondering if someone could give me some information on what to expect with Alzheimer's in the future? He's in the early stages right now, so he still knows names, faces, all of those things. He just has his moments when he thinks he's in another time period, usually things that he's never been through. I wanna know what to look for, when to call the doctor, all of those kinds of things.Thanks so much!~ Em"
