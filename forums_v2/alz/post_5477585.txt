"It's been one month since my mother doesn't recognise her own house anymore. She keeps asking me to take    her home and no matter what I tell her or do she believes she lives in a different place although she is, of course, at home ! How can I make her realise she never left her house ? Any suggestions, please ? Thanks !!!"
