"My dad suffers from AD.    He is 65 years old....diagnosed at 62 and is already considered early stage 2 of the disease.    My mom and myself are his primary caregivers (she lives at home w/ him I live in the same town, but with my son and husband..)    The AD came early, and, came quick.    I have watched my dad go from being my loving, sweet, intelligent dad.....to a nervous, obsessive, sometimes grouchy shell of himself.    I have seen cancer take people in what I thought to be the most viscious of ways...until now.    AD is by far one of the most devastating diseases I've ever come in contact with.    Utterly heartbreaking....I feel for each and every one of you who live with this disease...as patients or caretakers.I am always looking for new medicines to treat AD....looking for what's on the horizon. Several months ago I came upon a small article that talked about THC (the active component in Marijuana) being studied to inhibit plaque growth on the brain.    I've been constantly checking on these studies to see what has progressed and what I read is promising....http://www.babyboomer-magazine.com/news/123/ARTICLE/1131/2008-01-31.htmlWhat do you all think?    I think it's ironic...treating a disease that epitomizes forgetfulness with a drug that for years has been said to cause it??"
