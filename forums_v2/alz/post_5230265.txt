"I've noticed that an acquaintance who has early stage Alzheimers seems to be particularly sensitive to a very moderate amount of alcohol. This person shows pronounced decrease in communicative skills after consuming only 5 ozs of wine while showing no other signs of being tipsy. Is this increased sensitivity to alcohol characteristic of early AD patients?"
