"My mom (91) was in an alzheimers facility and last September they said I should consider hospice since she was not eating.    I couldn't do it and she ended up eating again.    Then In December she stopped eating again.    Hospice was once again suggested.    I agreed at that time and 5 days later she passed.    My dad is currently in an assisted living facility.    He is now 92.    He has parkinsons, only 19% renal function (1 kidney), has had some small TIA's (like small strokes) and doesn't want to see anymore doctors.    The facility has suggested Hospice for him.    I did agree, although to me he doesn't appear that bad.    It is my understanding that to qualify for hospice the patient would have less than 6 months to live.    When he was evaluated he did qualify.    I am getting really depressed.    I have not yet mourned my moms passing - lots of chaos in my personal life that I won't go into - but now facing this with my dad I seem to cry at the drop of a pin.    Can anyone shed more light on hospice?    I guess what I am wondering is how accurate are they in the evaluation and life expectancy."
