"Recently had ct in er finding is asymmetric and prominent on rt side lateral ventricle near frontal horn. There may be some mild non-infarct chronic microvascular ischemic change. Elsewhere the periventricular white matter looks normal No atrophy seen. Some    low attenuatioon along the white matter along the white matter below the right insula. I am very concerned not the doctor in er nor my regular doctor talked with me about this. Says I should consider a MRI. What advice do you have. Thank You"
