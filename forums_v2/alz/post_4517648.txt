"I√¢ Ä ôm 59 years old, male, Portuguese. A week ago in a routine CAT I found the following result (I did my best to translate into English in an accurate way):The encephalic appreciation shows diffusely enlarged spaces sulcus-cisternal, without notorious asymmetries, but constituting a pattern of diffuse cortical atrophy, of cerebral predominance although also attaining in the cerebellum vermian sulcus and superior cerebellum hemispheric. There are not relevant focal asymmetries, namely there are not signals of subdural hematome.Since I was not suspecting of anything and did the CAT only because I insisted with my doctor to do it because a friend of mine died a year ago with cerebral cancer, now I√¢ Ä ôm very concerned with this unexpected result.As soon as possible I will speak with my doctor, but I would appreciate very much if you could tell me what this may mean. Is it an indication of Alzheimer disease?I work as an engineer. Eight years ago I got the HCV, but I recovered by myself and the virus never came again - anyway could the present atrophy be a consequence? I drink a little, but there are periods that I succeed and don√¢ Ä ôt dink any alcohol.    I√¢ Ä ôm a pre-diabetic √¢ Ä ì I control my diabetes only with exercise.Many thanks for your helpAmadeu"
