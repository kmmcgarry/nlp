"I have been doing research on brain Lesions. One article said alzheimer's patients can have them.    I have had 4 MRI's I have brain lesions on my brain. Each MRI the lesions have not changed. The MS dr does not want to diagnose me. so I'm trying to find out more. My Great grandpa, Great grandma, Grandpa, two of his sisters and one daughter have or had all been diagnosed with ALzheimer's and no none of them had atopsys because they were diagnosed with it so we did not think they needed on. I    quess the main thing I'm asking is what are the posibilitie that what I have could be alzheimer's?"
