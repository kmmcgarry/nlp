"My sister 76 has had    Alzheimer for 4 years and we have just discovered a large lump in her breast. She is in the stage of not recognising anyone and just sits - therefore we have decided not to get the lump biopsy but I would like to know does she feels any pain from the breast or any where else she may have a ache? Many thanks"
