"Hello all,My cusin aged 32 is having alzheimer symtops-short term memory, tremor in his jaw muscles etc. Recently he tried using binaural music using headphones(there are various companies selling this music-holosync, hemisync, Immrama etc). He has experienced soothing effect using this music but we are concerned about side effects of using this music as it causes sometimes headaches and hangover kind of state. Please can anyone let me know if using such music safe for long term and any medical studies related to this music usage on alzheimer patient which are authentic."
