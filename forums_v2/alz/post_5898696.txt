"I am a active, female of 62 years of age, approx, 14 days ago I fell in the yard and broke 2 cartlidges near my sternum. The pain was bad for about 2 days but seemed to ease up the on my 4th day, I tried swimming on the 5th day, slight pain but on a scale of 1 to 10..... probably a 4...... I continue to have slight pain when getting out of a seated position, my question is ......will this damage me further to swim when I have slight pain or isn't exercise always good,,,,,I usually swim about 3/4 of a mile a day in the summertime which is about 27 laps in the city pool. my friends are threatening no sympathy if I continue to swim before I am completely pain free.    I also bike 2-3 times a week approx..8 miles at a time....I am a little worried about that stresss due to the hills I climb so I have not biked since my accident.    your input would be greatly appreciated....."
