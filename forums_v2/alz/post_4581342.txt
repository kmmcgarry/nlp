"Hi to all, I am a 30 year old male and I have been having this problem for many years now. I have some sort of shaking/vibration in my head and I am not sure where exactly it comes from. It severely affects my concentration and I have been unable to hold down a job. Sometimes it results in a crippling headache, other times I feel nauseous. I have tried to do some face exercises like clenching my jaw tightly and shaking my head but it wouldn't relieve the shaking. Due to the shaking/vibration i my head, I find it very hard to focus and do even some simple tasks. I ever had a CT scan done many years ago but it showed nothing. Basically I just feel like I will just have to live with this all my life. The problem becomes more servere when I am subject to stress. I am really at a lost as to how I can find a way to allievate this incessant shaking in my head. I can't concentrate on doing something for any long period of time. I also have a history of depression/OCD but I don't think it is the cause of this shaking. I almost feel like there is something shaking/shivering in my head and I am sure its not psychological. Many people tell me it is but after suffering for 10 years, I am sure its not. I am a very light smoker and these few days when I try to stop smoking completely, the shaking comes back. I sometimes feel so alone, and I know not many people understand what I am going through because I look normal on the outside. I also have problems doing some simple tasks at times like having enough focus to hold up a bowl of hot soup and place it properly on the table... It feels like there is this cloud over my brain that disturbs my focus...Please share any ideas or suggestions that you may have. Take care."
