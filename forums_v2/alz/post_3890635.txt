"My husband(68 years old) had a MRI without contrast recently that showed widespread atrophy and    white matter changes with probable amyloid angiopathy.    No aneurysm or vascular malformation is seen.    There was mention of possible NPH but the neurosurgeon feels hesistant to insert a shunt due to his past history of angioplasty(8 stents in right artery), lung cancer survivor, asthma.    He has all the symtoms(symptoms)of NPH...incontinence, confusion, and walking/balance difficulty.    Is there anything that can be done to reverse some of this, improve a little of it, halt the downfall.    He seems to be more and more confused, especially after laying down and taking a nap in the afternoon.    Is there anything medically that can be done for him?    Is there anything I can do to enhance his life?        What can I expect in the future?"
