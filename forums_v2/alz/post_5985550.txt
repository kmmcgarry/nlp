"I'm 67 yr old female, had aches and pains in hips and legs , shoulders extremely tired , doctor said fibromyaliga took Lyrica had serious reactionto drug, throat close , doctor prescribe Sevella was still fearful so I did not take this drug. I went to a Muscul/Skeletal center, there I was diagnosedwith reheumatoid arthritis, He also did other test and said I tested positive for Lupus , but because of the lack of other systems he didn't think I had that , also mild back flow of left heart valve. Treatment was a shot of cortisone in each hip and priscribed(prescribed)Meloxicam 1 day for 6 weeks this all helped a great deal.So I started packing for my road trip to NJ, the day before I awoke not feeling myself couldn't put a finger on it, waited a couple of more daysDepression thats what it is, called doctor asked him if Meloxicam could cause this , he said he didn't think so, he priscribed(prescribed)Sertraline, had servereside effects, extreme heart burn , sore throat, tongue and mouth blisterslost 8 lbs in 5 days, not complaining about that part.     Dr. prescribed Lexapro, rapid pound heart, weak and tingling in arms and legs.Stoped this drug. Asked Dr. about something natural he said St. John Wort. After all this I'm still depressed    so I did some research on St. John Wortside effects do not seem to be so extreme as the chemical drugsI've been taking now for 5 days a little upset stomach but other than thatI seem to be able to tolarate it and am still depressed but last 2 night I woke up from sleep with rapid heart beat could this be from St. John Wort or the Depression.    I feel like it is hopeless"
