"I am 52 years old, just recently I have been having trouble remembering things and having trouble with my speech.    I couldn't remember my husband's middle name or where I use to work.    Every once in awhile I slur my speech or don't make sense.    This just started happening but it doesn't happen frequently. Comes and goes."
