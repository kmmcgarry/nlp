"My father has advanced alzheimer's disease.    He doesn't speak and doesn't seem to recognize me when I see him though he responds to affection albeit very slowly.    He is in a nursing home.     He is on Respirdol among other things which slows him even more I suspect.     Would an increase in the frequency of visits make a difference in his memory of me?     Would he know it was even me who was visiting him?     Does he remember me, our past etc?     I realize these are fairly broad questions and there will be a spectrum of possible answers but any facts or opinions would be greatly appreciated.    Many thanks--J"
