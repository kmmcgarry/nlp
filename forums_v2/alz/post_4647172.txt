"My father has been a Altzheimer's facility for one year and was diagnosed a little over 2 years ago with the disease. .    Last night on the phone he was so clear and knew who I was and wanted to \"go home\".    Why does this happen.    One moment he is in \"la la land\" and the next moment he is so clear.    He is in Stage 6 - I thought this doesn't happen in Stage 6."
