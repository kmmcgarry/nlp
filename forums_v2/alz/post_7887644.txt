"my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2007.    i tried caring for her at home but could not longer do it. we (my sisters brothers and I) moved her to an adult care facility 1 24 12.    we were recently advised because her incontinence is un-managed we will need to soon place her in skilled nursing.    she is totally ambulatory, she is confused but still communicates (speaks).    we toured skilled nursing facilities and know it will kill her at least emotionally to be placed in a snf at this point in time.    we live in new york is it true that no longer understanding the process of relieving ones self but having the ability to get to the toilet is reason for skilled nursing placement?"
