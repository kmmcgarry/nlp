"mom is in stage 6. back to hopital to readjust meds for 2nd time. she hardly ever sleeps now. read recently that heavier seditives may be called for as last resort. we are at last resort. she has been taking .05 and 1mg adivan along with lortabs. they have never really helped but for a SHORT nap. Can anyone sujest what type of heavier sedatives might put her down for a good night (or days) rest? she also takes Remeron at bedtime along with other routine alzheimer meds."
