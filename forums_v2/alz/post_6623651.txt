"I am concerned about early onset ALZ. I have 8 siblings and two of them developed this around 58 yo (male) and they are both in homes now. one is 64 and very far along w/disease. The other is not that bad yet (60yo) but his wife put him in a home. I am concerned (as are my other siblings) about our risk. HELP"
