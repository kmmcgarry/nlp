"I am a 56 year old woman living    in the northern mid west.    Up here our winters tend to be cloudy and sunshine is the exception not the rule.    I have noticed the older I get, the more 'blue' days I experience.    I am in fairly good health with the exception of lower back issues.    I have degenerative disk disease for which I am undergoing pain management. I have an internal neuro-stimulator, wear fentanyl patches and use hydrocodon for break through pain.    I feel more pain when I get cold and consequently do not like to be outside at this time of the year.    Unfortunately I experience functional/depression- not sure that is an offocial thing but sums up my state.    I know I am depressed but can meet the basic requirements of my dialy living.    I find that I must force myself to go out and usually do so only when I can not avoid it.    This is beginning to affect the relationship with my husband.    I know there are many times that we would socialize if not for me 'not feeling well'.    I do not feel like this during the summer months, or when we vacation to warmer climates during the winter months.    I am physical when it is warmer.    I golf, garden, walk, etc.    I am wondering if this depression could be tied to sunlight deficiency or if it is just cold winter blues.    Any suggestions?"
