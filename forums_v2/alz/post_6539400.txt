"I am 28 yrs old.    I have IC.    I have been having recent short term memory loss.    I do not use drugs nor have I had any trauma.    What might be the cause of this.    I am not having any other symptoms of anything but not able to remember things of short term unless they are significant.    I can't remember things that I even did yesterday.    worst part is that I do not have insurance to get to a doctor to have tests ran to receive help that I might need to help find out what I have going on.    What can I do and what might be wrong with me?"
