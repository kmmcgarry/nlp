"HEllo, My dad is 66 years. he had his gall bladded removed some 6 years before. For abouot a few years before he started experiencing tingling, numbness in his legs, slow movement, imbalance etc. these effects are gradually increasing..we referred an doctor who suggested MRI of Cervico- dorsal spine....the reports suggested \"Patchy cord changes seen appearing hyperintense on T2W at D4-D5 on the right side. This could be secondary possibly due to demyelination or ischemic changes changes. No evidence to suggest Subacute Combined degeneration (SACD). No cord compression. No Cord SOL. No infective disease process in the spine\" \"Screening for the braion reveals bilateral frontopariental subcortical and deep white matter ischemic changes. Age related cortical changes with mild atrophy and bilateral frontoparental periventricular ischemia. No hemmorrahage or SOL\" The doctor suggested vitamin B12 injections. we gave him methycobalim injections for quite some time (it was weekly initially and then fortnightly and now it is monthly) HE also take Tab. Liofen (guess it is for muscular relaxation)lately the symptoms of imbalance, numbess while walking have increased. he looks like he is ageing(aging)faster.- What can be the reson for the patchy cord changes/demylineation? was Gallbladder removel(removal)the issue-    now what to do. the B12 supplements seems not to have worked as expected. the deteriorations seems to happenieng at a regular rate- Any other form of treatment that can help us here- dietary suggestions (my dad is veggie)- physiotheraphy....any suggestions will be appreciated.thanksREgardsPrafullMumbai"
