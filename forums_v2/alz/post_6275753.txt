"Hellosorry if this has been discussed before but I'm new to the forum.    My mother is very tired, often confused and has a shocking memory.    She also gets up at night and looks for things or wanders around.    The consultant has prescribed risperidone, although we were hoping for Aricept.    I am very concerned about this as internet research suggests it is for aggressive behaviour and will result in oversedation even drooling.    I don't want my mum to be a zombie - I'd just like her to be more like her old self.    Does anyone have any experience of this drug at all?    I'm not going to give it to her until I learn more.    Thank you"
