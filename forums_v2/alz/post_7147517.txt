"I'm a 51 year old man.My MRI Scan of Brain diagnosis read :MR reveals few punctuate T2 and FLAIR hyper-intensities in bilateral centrum semiovale.These are isointense on T1 and do not show restricted diffusion on DWI, suggestive of Chronic ischemic Microangiopathc changes.No evidence of acute infaract,hemorrhage,mass lesion,arteriovenous malformations, Chiari malformation/basal invagination or demyelination is seen.The doctor says I have high risk of Alzheimer's in a few years.How high is this risk?How accurate is this diagnosis?"
