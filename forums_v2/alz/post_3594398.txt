"My 78-yr-old mom has alzheimers and she has worn these special rings on her thumbs for arthritis for many years.    She says she can't hold anything without them.    She takes them off each night and puts them on in morning.    She was helping me clean the other day and put them in a place other than where she normally puts them, so she's forgotten to put them back on (this was a few days ago).    I noticed last night she hasn't been wearing them and she's picking up glasses to drink from, putting dishes away, etc. all things she's previously said she can't do without the rings.    I can't figure out what's going on with her now - now that she can do everything without the rings.    Is her brain now NOT telling her she has pain?    Thank you"
