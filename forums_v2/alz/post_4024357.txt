"My mother will be 53 next month. Over the last couple of years or so, I've noticed a bit of a decline in her cognitive skills. Her memory, problem-solving and decision-making skills seem to be deteriorating a little and I worry it could be something bad. I have suggested she look into it, but she thinks she's not old enough for these to be symptoms of anything and just dismisses it as her being generally aloof. I think 53 is pretty young for alzheimers, but is there anything else it could be? Should she see a doctor?She has also recently been diagnosed with arthritis in her lower back, and has been taking tamoxifen for a few years now, following the removal of a pre-cancerous mass in her left breast. I'm not sure if any of this matters, but I'm not a doctor so I don't know what might be connected.Thank you to anyone who can help."
