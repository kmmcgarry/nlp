"My grandfather is almost 87 years old. He's had Alzheimer's for about 8 years now. He's been in stage 7 for almost a year and a half, although the only criteria he doesn't meet is completely losing the ability to talk. (He can say 4-5 words at time, although most of it makes no sense). Last year he was in full renal failure from not eating, at which time my grandmother signed a DNI, DNR, and a living will. Some how he pulled through, but I think this is it now. 4 days ago he began freaking out more than usual, grunting and screaming and could not get comfortable. He's been wetting himself 4-5 times a day. Last night he was having trouble breathing, so they called 911. Today at the hospital they learned his heart has started beating irregularly, and he has a urinary tract infection that won't go away. He's a trooper, but I have a feeling he won't be coming out of the hospital this time. I live about 700 miles away from my entire extended family. Should I be planning (I'm a teacher) on going home for a funeral? What are your thoughts and/or experiences?"
