"Hi, my name is Michelle. I have a question about Alzheimer's. I read that there is a new product for Alzheimer's which is based on the results from the nun-study. They say it does not fight plaques but inflammation of the brains, which is, according to the nun study the root cause of Alzheimer's.The medicine is called OCW for Alzheimer's. Does anyone has any experience with that? Did someone try this OCW medicine? The website where they sell it and the film documentations there convinced me a lot but before I buy the product I want to ask whether someone has any experience with that.Thank you so much for your response.Kind regardsMichelle"
