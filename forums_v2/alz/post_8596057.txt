"my 60 yr old sister just received a diagnosis of probable alzheimers.    I am uncomfortable with this information/diagnosis and believe it is premature.    I am not EXACTLY sure these were the words used by the Dr, or just what her mind heard.    The Dr did a brain scan (not sure which type) and found spots on her brain.    He stated these spots may be due to small strokes which she suffered -at some time in her life- and intends to do additional testing(in attempt to determine the cause of the spots).    She has demonstrated    small levels of forgetfulness through the years, slightly increasing, but not to the point that it is affecting her functionality. She has ALWAYS been a bit 'scatter-brained' and she and her husband feel it has gotten worse.    The rest of the family, who do not see her regularily, have noticed a slight change when she is stressed only. Our father passed away 3 years ago from cancer (at 80) and had been diagnosed with Alzheimers 4 years earlier. His symptoms were obvious but he was still living at home with assistance from his wife. I am concerned that my sister, is using Dad's diagnosis as a fatalistic prognosis without waiting for a full/complete work up.    What can be told by brain spots?    What additional testing should we expect to see?    What reading is available for me to research Alzheimer diagnostics? She has not told the whole family 'until she gets the rest of the testing done', which I agree with.    I just wish she would wait for the tests too.    She believes she has alzheimers and consequently is very depressed.    I would like to help her open her mind to possible alternate diagnosis-at least until a more conclusive diagnosis can be made and other causes eliminated."
