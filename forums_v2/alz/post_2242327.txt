"My mother (91) is in a memory care nursing home.    I brought her (and my dad who is in assisted living) out to Arizona in May - they were both in a similar facility in New York.    It seems like my moms condition started to decline about 6 weeks after the move.    She has had Alz probably 4 years or better.    My dad did a great job of hiding it.    Recently she has been refusing to eat.    She has lost weight and is weak.    The home suggested getting her evaluated for hospice which I did, and yes she \"qualifies\".    I had the hospice lady speek with my dad who seems against it.    I think he may feel that she will be relocated to another facility and would not be able to see her - but I am not sure.    He is a man of very few words.    Shortly after the evaluation she began eating again so I did not follow thru with anything.    Now she has stopped eating again the the home is very concerned and once again suggested hospice.    They tell me she would stay right there.    I do have a meeting with the social worker tomorrow to discuss her care plan.    I feel as if by my moving her maybe I caused the decline.    I also don't want to initiate anything to upset my dad.    My mom did sign a health care proxy many years ago and stated that if she were to have an irreversible physical or mental disease that she be allowed to die peacefully.    Has anyone been thru this or can anyone offer suggestions?"
