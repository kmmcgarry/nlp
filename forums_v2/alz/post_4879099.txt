"I am a 61 year old women who is on med's for high blood pressure, cholestorol, blood thinner, and maybe several years ago I might of had a TIA? They didn't know for sure at the ER/     I saw a report from my MRI recent report, which said I had this small cyst in my brain.I always had this one problem for years that is remembering peoples names. But most recently I am having problems with other things that I never had before remembering. I make up excuses with people around me so they won't know.I have to fig out a different doctor to see.    My doctor is ok if you got the flu but not anything else.    He isn't thorough."
