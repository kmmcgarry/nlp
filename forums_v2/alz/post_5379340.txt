"My wife's father has AD about a year now. Has good days and bad but progressively getting worse. He is now living with her sister and her two kids. The kids are driving him crazy. He says mean and hurtful things and resists moving in with my wife and I. We can't seem to convince him to come with us. And he thinks everyone is out to get him.Any suggestions?Thanks, Bob"
