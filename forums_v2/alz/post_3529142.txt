"My mother is 65. She is terrified of getting AD, because her own mother has it. She has been having very mild memory troubles that may or may not be early symptoms of AD for a couple of years. But the other day, something very different happened to her. She was visiting my brother, and they were talking about her house, when suddenly she couldn't picture her house or anything about it. This lasted almost a minute.She is convinced that this episode means that she does indeed have Alzheimer's. She's going to see a neurologist. But I'm not so sure. From what I've read, it doesn't sound like something that happens to a patient in the very early stages of AD. Sounds more like a TIA or something. Does anyone know? Thanks."
