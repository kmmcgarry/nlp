"Hey everyone!I'm 32yo female, and something's up with my 65yo father. There's alcoholism, NPD, and OCD, but it looks like he's getting Alzheimer's as well. So far he's still living on his own, being \"independent\". I've been watching after him, but recently, with these funny Alzheimer's issues, I cannot be sure he (or his surroundings) are safe if he's not supervised 24/7. A doc here told me to keep sharp objects out of my father's reach, but I can't do it as all of my involvement is framed as support, advice, or, in the worst cases, threat to remove privileges. But he's still a free person, having choices.Now I need to confront him with the need to get evaluated, thus a chance of supervision, and, considering alcoholism and NPD, this would be a tough discussion. I myself am in no danger, I'll surely get a backup before I approach him with it. But I don't want to make it harder on him than it has to be, and I want to be successful: to get him to agree to be evaluated, to make it to the appointment, etc, whatever comes next, I don't know how it works when people can't manage on their own and someone gets to control them.I know I must be sounding bad: I don't even have a diagnosis, and already want him locked up. As if that was all I cared about. Yet he's literally dangerous to himself and others, this is the main issue, I want to ensure everybody's safety. I raised the issue a few times, suggestively, and got a strong refusal (Do you dare to say I'm insane?!!!).How do you confront them for the first time? How do you get them to cooperate with docs? I understand they do get angry even without alcoholism and NPD, so it must be a tough discussion for all. How did it go with you? What did you do? What happened? What do you wish you've done differently? What proved to be a good decision? How did your parent react?Thank you very much!!!"
