"HiI'm very worried about my girlfriend. She occasionally forgets words (she notices this) and also mixes words up - he/she - knife/fork. I should point out that English is not her first language, but she tells me she sometimes forgets words in polish too, and she never used to do this before.Recently she seems to forget things, like her phone or keys.She has been to the doctor and scored perfectly on the cognitive test - Count backwards from 100 by deducting 7 - Remember these three items - What is the date? -    Those kind of things.The doctor has ordered blood tests (Thyroid - blood count - liver function - and some others) But we haven't had the results yet.She has recently started a new business (investing her own money) and I know that this is a stress on her. Although she never acts stressed or tells me she feels stressed.Has anyone gone through anything similar? I am so worried that she is getting worse.Thanks,Paul"
