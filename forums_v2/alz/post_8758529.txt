"My dad has cirrhosis of the liver caused from a blood clot in his portal vein.    We are accustomed to dealing with personality issues from his ammonia levels.    He was recently diagnosed with moderate Alzs although we think he has been undiagnosed for years.    He is currently hospitalized and physically restrained because he became combative in the nursing home.    His ammonia level was elevated but has come down.    However, the agitation/aggression hasn't changed.     The dr started him on namenda last week.    Has anyone seen this kind of aggression from namenda??    HELP!!"
