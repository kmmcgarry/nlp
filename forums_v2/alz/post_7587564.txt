"My 93 year old mother is loosing her cognitive memory and abilities. Does that have anything to do with the fact that when she is tired, she looses strength in her left leg and tends to fall. When real tired, she can not move. After a brief rest, she can move for a few moments but scared now that she might fall again. Does anyone aware of these symptons? No pinched nerve and brain scans show nothing."
