"My mom is 80 years old with the onset of alzheimner`s disease.    She just fell and hit her head on the driveway.    She had stitches on the side of her head and had blood on her brain. The cat scan showed no sign of brain damage.    She has been stabalized and has left ICU. While she was in ICU she recognized family members and spoke short sentences.    Since leaving ICU she now does not speak and had a high fever which they say is contributed by a bladder infection.    The doctor says her lack of speech and confusion is from the infection. She is worse then ever its been a week since her injury. Ã‚ »What can be the problem-she is in a top nerological hospital in Buffalo, N.Y. noone has any answers-they just keep telling us to wait until infection clears up. Apparently, no damage to brain and blood on brain is slowly going away.    Please help-what can be going on- She was on Plavix before injury and no more blood is leaking on the brain."
