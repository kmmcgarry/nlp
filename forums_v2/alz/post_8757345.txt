"My nanny is 86 and has had the disease for several years.    She is now hallucinating often.    She hardly ever sleeps.    The drs have her on klonopin and Ativan but nothing helps her sleep.    She has slept two hours in 50.    Is this normal?     Should we try sleeping meds without the drs prescribing it?"
