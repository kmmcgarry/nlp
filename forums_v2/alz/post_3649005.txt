"My mother-in-law is 78 and we believe she has Altzheimers.    My question is whether having altzheimers causes the person to return to extremely negative bahavior (extreme irrational anger, bitterness, stubborness and just plain hatefullness) towards adult children where there had been a reconciliation for 6 years?    She also seems to lack care about the progress of her husband (who is 87) who is in a convelscent center with a broken hip.    My husband indicatesthat she has always been somewhat uncaring towards her five children and has seemed to return to these same reactions.Thank you for any help.............the family is in an uproar without answers."
