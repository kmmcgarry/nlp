"A lot of points have to be touched, and I have to mention a few points so I will try to make this short. At my early days of 13 - 16 I was doing drugs heavily. I've always laughed how I've never gotten an after effect. I know I suffered from a memory loss at a young age because I blacked out most of my youth from 8 - 17. Nowadays, which is only 5 years later I can hardly remember what I did last night, what I ate at yesterday's breakfast. In the past few months I've been unemployed and I am not sure if these are common signs of depression but I lost most of my friends, and I rarely leave the house. When my wife mentions something that I forget, I always panic and try to hide it which resolves us in getting into a fight.Is there anything I can do to practice on memory loss?"
