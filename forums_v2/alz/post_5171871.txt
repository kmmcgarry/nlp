"In responding to a previous question, my 89 year old mother withalzheimer's started grinding her teeth about a year ago. I've found that giving her a piece of gum to chew alleviates the grinding.    She grinds her teeth many different times--I don't feel that it is always stress related..    I have even heard her tell herself to stop! She even grinds her teeth sometimes while she is reading something aloud to herself (can talk and grind at the same time)Hopefully , chewing gum will alleviate the problems for some others.This discussion is related toAlzheimers and grinding of teeth."
