"Struggling for answers, finding it hard for doctors to belive me as I am so young. I am a RN and what I was taught is that if you know there is something wrong with you there is. My higher family also has odd, similar symtpoms, so I'm beginning to think it's one of those rare genetic disorders. I have a positive ANA, joint pain, extreme fatigue, initially diagnosed with lupus, now I swear I have symtpoms similar to MS. I have spine and bone problems as my family does. I have major GI issues, like my family, and it looks like I will need a bowel resection. My mom has lupus. My aunt has symptoms milder than mine. My other aunt has DI and is allergic to every antibiotic once she takes it. Because I am 23 doctors tend to label me as a psych case or a drug seeker. For that reason I know I must get a diagnosis in order for them to believe me so that I may get my symtpms treated and go back to doing what I love and do best; Hospice nursing and finish getting my NP in palliative care. Thank you."
