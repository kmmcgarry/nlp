"I am on morphine for pain, so my memory is .... a memory.    But I either read or heard of a treatment for Alzheimer's by a shot to the lower spine.    Reversal starts that day.Was I dreaming?     Any of you heard of this?    I think it was on a local TV channel a few months ago, so the treatment is relatively new.If there is such a shot, I can't help wonder what the side effects are.     Sorry, I don't remember the name of the drug."
