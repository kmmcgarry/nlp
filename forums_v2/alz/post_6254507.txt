"I am a 46 year old male that has been experiencing some memory problems. Most people I know have memory problems so the question is what's normal. I can remember verbatim the last 30 to 50 words spoken on a television show or my locker combination from elementary school. But I can't remember where I set stuff down. I forget that I turned the tea kettle on or put a bag of popcorn in the microwave. I do remember it hits me, when I look for my tea. I talk with friends who share some difficulties but it is scaring me.I have an uncle who has alzheimers and a neighbor who was in her forties when it struck her. I used to pride myself in the fact that I could remember everything from my license number to credit card numbers. I can still play simon online. But I am not sure if that's a different type of memory.I realize that anyone can get it but for two unrelated people that live across the street from each other to get it at such an early age would be really something."
