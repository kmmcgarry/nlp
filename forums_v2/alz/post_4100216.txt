He'll give some convincing reasons for this link that most doctors are unaware of. Dr. Jones will be discussing how this common sleep disorder is a likely cause of Alzheimer's and possibly a host of other neurologic conditions.To register and receive the teleconference call in number, click http://www.westside-ent.com/teleseminarsignup.htmlIf you can't make it, register anyway and you'll get a link to the recording afterwards.http://www.medhelp.org/user_journals/show/71671"
