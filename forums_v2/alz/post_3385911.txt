"Im 18 years old and have recently been having a strange sensation. It's difficult to describe, but Im going to give it try. The first symptom is frequently becoming suddenly aware of my surroundings. The only thing I can compare this to is standing up too quickly and \"browning out\". The sensation you get the instant you return from the blackout is what I'm experiencing. If i think about it, Im able to recall all of the details of how i got where I am. However, the strange part is that it doesn't feel like it was part of the same moment, but instead like I'm trying to recall yesterdays events. Its like a brief lapse in my short term memory. Having to consciously try to remember the previous events and there significance in my life is very unsettling.The second symptom is that live events don't fully register with my brain. Life feels much more like a movie than reality, and I have almost zero sense of self. I will be in a place and every so often it will occur to me that the event is actually taking place. I should state however that Im in no way depressed, just that nothing quite feels real. Physical exercise seems to temporarily stop all of the above symptoms, and Im active as often as possible.I know Im not giving you much to work with, but any advice would be helpful. Im basically asking if you think something is wrong, or if Im just becoming an adult.Much Thanks"
