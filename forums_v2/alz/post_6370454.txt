"My mother is experiencing a lot of memory loss and can barely do things for herself. She is 53 years old and alzheimer's runs in her family. She is currently on two types of medication that don't seem to be helping but do seem to be making her severely depressed. We just got a copy of her MRI and I just want someone that can summarize it for us in layman's terms.Findings: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with sagittal and coronal T1-weighted images, diffusion weighted axial images, gradient echo acial images, FLAIR axial images and fast spin-echo T2-weighted axial images on a 1.5 Yesla MR unit.There is a punctate hyperintensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images in the right posterior frontal corona radiata white matter, and several additional punctate hyperintensities in the left parietal subcortical white matter. The ventricles and cortical sulci maybe mildly prominent for the patien'ts age. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass-effect or extra-axial collection.Flow-voids are identified in the interal carotid and basialar arteries consistent with their patency.There is mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary and left ethmoid sinuses and mild to moderate inflammatory signal abnormailty and bilateral inferir mastoid air cells. The visualized portions of the remaining paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, nasopharynx and orbits are unremarkable.Impression\" Mild ventricular and sulcal prominence for age which could be within the range of normal limits, or could be due to mild cerebal atrophy. Several supratentorial white matter hyperintensities are present, which is a nonspecific finding that may be due to multiple etiologies including small vessel ischemic demyelinaation, demyelinating disease, migraine headaches, Lyme diesease, viral disease and vasculitis."
