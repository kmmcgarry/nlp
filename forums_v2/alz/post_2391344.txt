"At the age of 57, my husband was diagnosed with degenerative brain disease. He is now 63 years of age. On November 20, 2007, he was placed in a nursing home. My husband knows who I am, but can only say a few words (what, no). He is totally dependent on the staff to feed, clothe, bathe, etc. He only says    (2) words (No and what). Is this the usual progression of this disease?I have MRI's (inconclusive), spinal taps, etc.Did I miss anything?"
