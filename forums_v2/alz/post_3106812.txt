"My mother in law is about 78 yrs old and still active but was just recently diagnosed with alzheimers.    She has not been feeling well lately.    Dizzy, no appetite and very tired.    The dr says that one of her kidneys is only functioning at 50%.    We want to know what we should do and what it could be.    Thanks for any advice."
