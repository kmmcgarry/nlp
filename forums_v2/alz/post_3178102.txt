"It's finally happened...My Grandma's alzheimers has finally escalated to the point that she has developed super human strength and energy...And is scary angry...She has attempted to strangle the group home staff, has smacked the other residents, is tearing apart everything she can get her hands on,(actually pulled the top off a dresser!), spits her medications in the faces of those who try to give them to her, sits on other patients beds and urinates on them (purposefully), and frequently exit seeks -bolting past anyone if the door is open..and has paranoid behaviors (They're trying to kill me! We must hide!) There's much, much, more...this has been worsening over the past 2 1/2 months and the Drs seemed unwilling or unable to manage her medications enough to get her to a \"happy place\" before it got this bad...I tell myself that those things take time, but I see her completely losing it, and am frustrated with the process...sigh...all I want is for her to have a small quality of life again..And I'd like to have my life back too...I can't get anything done because I'm constantly babysitting her in attempts to calm her and keep her from destroying the home, and it's destroying my marriage and 9 year old daughter's summer vacation...I don't know how it's possible to love someone so much, and yet desire to strangle them....                                        ~MM"
