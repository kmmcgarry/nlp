"My husband is 47 years old.    Two years ago I started noticing significant change in his thought process.    Evenually, in May of 2008 he went to see a NeuroPsyc. where he was diagnosed with ADHD.    He did not receive any Meds until December.    He is an Engineer Assistant for a large utility company.    In August of 2008 he received his first warning in 10 years for poor communication, not following through ect.. I didn't find out about the warning until March.    In April he had an MRI and went to see a Nuerologist, who put him on Aricept as a precaution, and starting running tests for Alzhiemer.    He also went back to the NeuroPsyc for a second evalution which showed his memory had improved but his cognition was only at 30% now.    Since then we have had a PET Scan which showed syptoms(symptoms)of Early Onset Alzhiemers.    He lost 30 lbs. on the Aricept with no change in his mental state.    He is having severe headaches, hand tremors. balance problems, nasea, mood issues as well as thought processing.    There are times where he looks very pasty.    We went to a Psyciatrist last Thursday.    He has taken him off of Adderall(adderrall)and Straterra and He will start Cymbalta 60 mg. and Lamital today.     He is on sick leave until July.    We have no action plan right now.    We are not scheduled to go back to the Nuerologist until July.    His symptoms have gotten incresing worse in the last week.    Please give me your expert advise on what you would do if it were your spouse."
