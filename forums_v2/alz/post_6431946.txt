"www.    free patents online.        com    /        20090204058.     pdfSorry have to space it out or the filters will block it.THis patent is a device that claims to remove aluminum and other compounds from the brain.    Its an electrode with cathode placed on the back of the skull and the anode placed up the nasal passage.    A low DC current is passed through creating a field that will draw the toxins toward the anode for removal.     This is the first invention Im aware of (thats not saying anything ;-) that addresses the removal of heavy metals like Aluminum from the brain.    Its non envisage and it states could be used on a daily basis if needed.Among the inventors listed Johnson and Johnson either bought it, or financed the development.Where is this device? If need be I will build on out myself, if they are squatting on the patent.Here is part of the patent:BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the cleavage of beta amyloid protein precursor from the intracellular membrane often produces a protein AB-42 which is incompletely removed by normal clearance processes. Over time, this protein is deposited as a beta amyloid protein AÃŽ ² plaque within brain tissue, leading to the local destruction of neurons. The AÃŽ ² plaque deposition is also believed to provoke an inflammatory response by microglia and macrophages. These cells are believed to respond to the plaque deposition by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although the inflammatory response may be provoked in an effort to clear the brain tissue of the detrimental plaque, it is now believed that this inflammation also injures local neuronal tissue, thereby exacerbating AD.High levels of aluminum, copper, iron, and zinc have been found in the brains of AD patients. For example, Finefrock, J. Am. Geriatr. Soc., 51, 1143-1148, (2003)It has been hypothesized by Finefrock, supra, that age-related dyshomeostasis and environmental accumulation are responsible for these high metal levels.Furthermore, it is believed that these heavy metals play a critical role in the precipitation of BAP. It is known that BAP binds to these heavy metals and even has highly specific binding sites for copper. Accordingly, high levels of these heavy metals have been found in BAP plaques. Huang, J. Nutrition, 2000, May 130(5S Supp.) 1488S-92S).Moreover, since both copper and iron are redox active, these metal-laden deposits act as catalysts for cell-free redox reactions that generate hydrogen peroxide and consequently highly toxic hydroxyl radical.Accordingly, it is believed that higher-than-normal levels of heavy metals in the brain are deleterious because they not only promote the deposition of BAP plaques, a portion of them promote oxidative stress when deposited.Aluminum is of particular concern. It has long been hypothesized that aluminum plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD, although this point has remained controversial. Nonetheless, according to Gupta, Cell Mol. Life Sci., 2005 Jan. 62(2) 143-58, the neurotoxic effects of aluminum are beyond any doubt. Moreover, it has further been reported that, once it has entered the brain, aluminum is fairly persistent. Yokel, Toxicol. Sciences, 64, 77-82 (2001) has hypothesized an aluminum half-life in the rat brain of about 150 days, and in the human brain of about 12 years. According to Yokel, supra, repeated aluminum exposure paired with aluminum persistence produces aluminum accumulation. Therefore, the neurotoxicity and the long-half life of aluminum have made it a potential therapeutic target for AD.I have a patent in a different field but accidentally found this since it is tagged with the word electrode (which is what my patent is listed with)    After reading this I started connecting the dots with some symptoms I and many others are experiencing.    The strange \"migraine after 2 drink\" sufferers seems to be growing and it was only after I found this site that I learned I was not alone.I watched a documentary just recently called \"what in the world are they spraying\" (you can watch it on youtube, just search for it by name) and suddenly realized this could be the cause of our problems, and if hard data can be collected to back it up, would shed light on the increase of AH we see today.I would be willing to subject myself for testing if anyone is willing to discuss it further.    If a sample of tissue from the sinus area was tested and came back positive for the same compound they are using for the geoengineering spray campaign we see over our heads on almost a daily basis, (aluminum, chromium, and sulphur compounds) we may have some answers.Comments can be directed to \"dallasgoldbug    at     g mail    dot    com\""
