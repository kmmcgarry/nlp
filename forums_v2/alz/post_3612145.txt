"My 96 yr old mother who is cared for by my sister gets real upset and forgetful with the least    stressful situation.Dr. told sis about two years ago that he could not prescribe medicine for her unless she personally agreed that she was having trouble. Is this true with all doctors? We all know there is a problem and feel that some sort of med would greatly improve her quality of life."
