"I am suffering from mental confusion. While I read any book or advertisement I have to read the letters of the words very slowly and takes a bit of time to know what word (words) are they. If I look a long view my head reels and I get mental confusion for the vehicles and people and it takes some time for me to recognize them.I have cervical spondilitisI have sinusitis.Does these two defects cause mental confusion? Kindly someone advice."
