"Hi, I read that aluminum is possibly one of the causes of alzheimers?    Or some people have some sort of gene that allows aluminum to pass the blood brain barrier?I was just wondering... does anyone know that if aluminum passes the blood brain barrier, is it possible that it can go back the other way?    Or is the blood brain barrier just a one way street?Anyone know of any great ways for aluminum detox?I'm 24 and I have serious memory problems.    I need a serious detox and just looking for answers."
