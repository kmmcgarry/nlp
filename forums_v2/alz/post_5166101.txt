"Hello. My Grandfather is currently in the hospital with end stages of alzheimers and he has lost the ability to swallow and is having muscle contractions where it looks like he \"wants to sit up\" I haven't seen him in quite awhile and when my daughter and I went to visit him he looked up at us and reached for my daughter, and when she bent down to him, he tried to kiss her on her head. Our family has decided to let him pass on because of the inability to swallow, and a feeding tube would only prolong his suffering with this disease. I guess my question is basically this...is it possible for him to have short spurts of remembering? He would fall \"out of it\" then kindof look around and seem like he was \"there\" I asked him \"are you ready to go home and get out of this hospital, I know that bed has got to be killing your back\" and he said YEAH in a whisper. He hasn't eaten anything for 5 days and I was told he can't swallow, but when I gave him a little bit of water thru a straw...he held onto it for a second in his mouth, then eventually swallowed on his own. Is this common in the end stages of alzheimers where they do this sort of remembering and acting off and on??"
