"Has anybody ever heard of this before? My teenage daughter decided 2 years ago that she wanted to go vegetarian and I started using more soy to make sure she was getting enough protein. Lately, I decided maybe I'd join her to get a little healthier, etc. and I had someone just recently tell me that eating too much soy can lead to Alzheimers. Has anyone else ever heard of this? Should we not eat soy? My friend who told me this said she read this in a book and that they did a study, etc. Has anyone else ever heard of this? Now I'm not sure what to think. I thought soy was supposed to be good for you. It's just a little bean! Anybody know? I'd appreciate more information on it if anybody knows. Thanks,"
