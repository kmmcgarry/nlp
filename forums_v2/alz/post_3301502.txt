"Hi, Im 22 years old and I am having short term memory loss. Ive read up on it, and for the record, im not on drugs, no std's, no trauma to the head, and ive never been pregnant. I forget entire conversations ive had, i forget im cooking, i completley forget a lot of movies ive seen, i could watch them again, and feel for the most part that ive never seen it. I forget small things like when im supposed to be somewhere or where i put something, even if i tell myself, \"remember to do this\", or \"remember where you put that\", like a hiding spot or something. Its weird.. and part of me thinks my life is busy.. its normal to forget things, but than when I have my mom and my friends, asking me with a serious face if i remember this or that and than telling me that there might be something wrong, than I second guess the situation. So, am I normal, or could this be something to get checked out? Also, what might this be from, if anything. Any information would be greatly appreciated....thank you!"
