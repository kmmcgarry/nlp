"Hi, I am writing a book and I thought I might get a professional to answer some questions about amnesia.The protagonist wakes up on a boat, unable to remember his name and recent events, however, he remembers everything before 2 weeks ago very clearly, but not his name.Is this medically possible? If not, what kind of memory loss could best fit this plot?Thank you!"
