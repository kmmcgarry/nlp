"ok.. I started noticing this after I smoked. I smoked weed one day and had lots of twitches. Like random body parts would like just involuntarily move.But then like ever since then I've been having these muscle twitches. And I was looking up what it could be and I found like something about it being a sign of it. I also notice that i get them more after I use drugs for some reason.. Like when I smoked a cigarette I get them for the next day a lot more. The same with if I drink or with opiates... Why does it increase when I do drugs?And maybe I am just over analyzing this.. idk. My mom recently died from it though and I think I inherited it. Her dad died from the same disease too. my dad said that the test results of if she really had hd were negative but she had all the symptoms. Or could it possibly be she had another disease?And I think I read that like the more it's passed, the earlier in age the symptoms occur. I am only 17, does it ever come on this young?"
