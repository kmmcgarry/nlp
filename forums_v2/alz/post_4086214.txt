"I have custody of my 54 yr old brother who is down syndrone but was functioning well until he had a stroke last yr. and was diagnosed as having Alzheimer.    He now does not want to feed himself most of the time, don't want to eat much, has accidents on himself, won't get out of bed to go to the bathroom unless I help him ect.    Can someone please tell me what to expect next?     How many stages are there to this?    My email is ***@****.    Any info would be appreciated.    His blood pressure is very low and he passed out 2 times for a couple of min.in the past 6 months.    He picks at imaginary things and says there are ants in his food.....like pepper.... and ants on his clothes ect.    Is this part of it.    he sees our dead mom too.ThanksMary"
