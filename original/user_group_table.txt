vertigo	VERTIGO	Public	 Neurology 	31	VERTIGO can cause a variety of symptoms.......Vertigo is a treatable condition without the use of drugs.  I am not a physician. I speak only from experience.Some symptoms are: dizzy, vomiting, tiredness, weakness, poor cognition and more.After ruling out other serious conditions, see an ENT specialist.  He/she can diagnose Vertigo in seconds..........He/she can treat Vertigo in minutes with one maneuver called Epley.  There are other maneuvers......this worked for me. Experiencing Vertigo is scary and debilitating. What better than a cure with no pills and only takes minutes?

behcet_s_disease___neuro_behcets_	Behcet's Disease & Neuro behcets 	Public	 Autoimmune 	3	Hi I am recently diagnosed with NBD and thought i would start this user group for people like me and also people at the start of trying to get some answers to their questions pre- diagnoses.I felt the hardest thing for me over the years of limbo was knowing I had this and people thinking I was mad, So my first pearl of wisdom is   seek the best neurologist you can afford and no matter where they are in the World go and see them as this will save you thousands and will also cut out all the crap one is faced with seeing under qualified people. Normal people say "I just don't know when asked a question" Some Doctors are so arrogant they can not say this basic sentence it is beyond them. So it is easier to accuse the client of been insane even doe the medical evidence says otherwise. So class lesson number one you know you, don't let anyone try and convince you otherwise, My illness started with itchy hands and then progressed to mild mathematical disfunction, visual disturbance, and then after 2 years muscle twitching, tremor and   weakness this is not all the time but most days.I also get mouth sores and yes the unmentionables get the lesions as well, I have been tested for stiffer-less and VD more times than any porn star. So lets get this rolling i am open to your questions !

bipolar_central_website_a_scam_and_here_s_why____	Bipolar Central Website a SCAM and here's why....	Public	 Mental/Emotional Health 	1	I just had to write to this guy and finally tell him what I thought about his so called "Website" and emails to help people that suffer from Bipolar Disorder. I hate to see people being scammed like this.. So, I let the guy know what I thought. It might be interesting to someone one day, and helpful.My Email:Your last âBipolar Newsâ made mention of articles being too violent... but as Iâve received your newsletters on a regular basis, I just had a few comments to make that have nothing to do with the âImportant Notice"If you donât mind, and this may well help, Iâll mention a few things I notice about your website and your emails.Iâll give you a rundown of what stands out.In this article you say â I can only post what I getâ and âIâm not a news stationâ and âI donât have the time or resources to search endlessly for bipolar news everywhereâ âAlso, I donât filter the news I receive. I simply get it through many expensive and reliable news services and make it available to you.âClick there and you change your tune a bit: I personally spend dozens of hours each week researching the latest developments in bipolar disorder, interviewing people with bipolar disorder and their supporters, and finding experts in the medical community who have new and helpful information to share with my readers. Any âexpertâ that I feature in my products or hire to help create these resources first must undergo an intense grilling â¦ where I pick apart every aspect of their story and advice. More than 75% of the people I meet and the information I uncover is disqualified as worth of sharing with you. In these resources, youâll get only tested, proven and thoroughly validated strategies, tactics and advice.This is certainly not what your recent newsletter claims. You âsimply get your information from many expensive and reliable news servicesâ - and by that I am guessing you search the web for any article that has the word âBipolarâ in it and then link it to your site. Letâs start with the banner ad on the left of the page.âNeed Money for Bipolar Disorder?â - âWork from Homeâ âStart Immediatelyâ âEarn up to $1000+ weeklyâ âStart Part-Timeâ âFree DVDâ âclick here - FREE. etc..âFirst, you must know that a person with BP disorder is going to be highly interested in not leaving the house, being bad with money and always need it, might not be able to work a full-time job, and thepart-time âhookâ only makes it more attractive, almost as much as the âStart Part-Timeâ as if it were a âJobâ. Then, it takes you to a site that has an article/e-book/catalog or whatever for these people who âNeed Moneyâ - and Iâm wondering where this up to $1000 weekly comes from? Free DVD of what? âhow to make money?âIt simply looks like another way to guide some already misguided and perhaps manic readers of your newsletter where they expect to make money but instead need to pay money.If Iâm wrong, please correct me.You sign off, after offering these helpful items to put in you âcartâ by this:Good luck â¦ and I wish you great success as you deal with this destructive disorder. Iâll talk to you again soon,On this page: http://www.bipolarcentral.com/bipolarnews.phpThe links on the right side have server 403 errors, donât work, or they appear as a helpful article that leads you to yet another place to purchase something to âhelpâ âsufferersâ.Iâve read your emailsIâve looked at your articles that are all scraped content from the webI know you can set your Search Engine to use keywords to pull up any news on the web about BP Disorders and other related âDisordersâI know that the content is not original and your comments above are redundant... Are you a person who spends Dozens of hours each week researching the latest developments as you claim, or are you a   â I can only post what I getâ and âIâm not a news stationâ and âI donât have the time or resources to search endlessly for bipolar news everywhereâ âAlso, I donât filter the news I receive. I simply get it through many expensive and reliable news services and make it available to you.â???Your newsletter, when there is one, is copied content and rarely interesting. Your entire site is devoted to making money for yourself using the desperation of âallâ these people:â¢ People withâ¢ Supporters ofâ¢ Forward to friendsAll the links at the top âHealth Directoryâ for example, are third party affiliates that pay you when someone clicks and itâs all under the Umbrella of âBipolar Centralâ and in this very small print - Note: These sites are displayed only as an informational resource to our site visitors. The owner of this website does not warrant or endorse any site listed here and is not liable for the content or actions of these sites. Please use these resources only at your own discretion. Thank you.You add links that you donât endorse and claim no liability for the contents or action of these sites.I just want you to know that I am too a sufferer of BP disorder, and I am an intelligent person who yes, have had my serious ups and downs like most BP people do. I find this site to be not madefor the âuserâ but made for you, simply to give poor information, or links to purchase information with exciting claims. Your âsupportersâ of BP people, desperate to get help, are lead to a site where theyalso have to purchase information.I just realized, you did not create this site to help people, but to make the most money possible for yourself by these people with âthis destructive disorderâ.I feel sorry for the people who have paid to order these articles, and fall for all the other affiliates that profit from it.  Toss in some âWant to Lose Weight?â and âWant to stop Panic Attacksâ and â Amazing new system, click here>>>â Itâs a simply ghastly website and to think that you are using it to help is so sad, as these people are sometimes so desperate.  Iâd simply say, go see a doctor and follow their advice.Add a link to the SSA site for information on applying for disability.Have links to true sites that give people an opportunity for real information from authoritative sources, recommend blogs...Links to the Mayo Clinic or the NIH... no, they are free and not what your intentions are. You, simply put are scamming people, people who have a mental disorder, out of their money.You allow people to send you an email, but you donât let people show comments they make to you or about your site. Youâve created a shield.Itâs so unfair and self-serving, your website, for all the reasons Iâve listed above. Itâs a cheap and shabby site and in my opinion ( unsolicited of course ) a SCAM. A ripoff and you make yourselfout to be this âexpertâ because your mother was sick.What background in mental health issues do you have? What training have you gone through to be offering advice?Iâm seriously curious. Youâd never let me leave a comment like this for other people to read... would you?  Itâs too true.My best wishes, and glad I got this off my chest.
bilateral_diaphramatic_paralysis	Bilateral Diaphramatic Paralysis	Public	 Rare Diseases 	1	Well it is January 20, 2013 I have had a lot of things good and bad happen to me... I thought I would add to my last post. First I am considered Perm. Disabled. I have been approved for Social Security Disability... I also have gotten my New York State Retirement Disability. This all happen by October 2011.... I was Approved on my 1st Application. 2nd My Doctors all are on the same page as they all were in April of 2011 when this all began. They all feel that the Bilateral Diaphragmatic Paralisys that I have been told I have is due to some sort of MDS thing. The problem is that they feel that it has not been discovered yet. They feel that someday it might but the sad thing is more people have to come down with this problem before they will even think to spend the Millions it cost to do Medical testing on it. There are Doctor's in New Jersey and in West Vergina that do proceedures on Diaphragms but they only deal with one side not both. So here is an update on my life. I am doing ok. I get very tired very very fast. It is not like wow I am getting Tired it is like oh man I need to sit NOW and REST NOW. I do have a Chair to use when I go to the Store or Mall. I have Sex with my Wife and I am done all the next day. If I talk a lot during the day I am more tired that night. I have been doing my Family tree. I have had my Mom come over to help me with it. I might work on it for a Couple of hours and then I am done. It is all on the Computer no WORK required but I am tired and have to sit down and rest. The other day I got up when 20 mins over the hill to pick up my Mom took her to Rochester for a Dr's appointment, went to lunch, came home to my house rested a couple of hours, then went to the Funeral home in Geneseo and then went to dinner. By this time I was so tired that my wife had to drive to Dansville to take Mom home and back to our house. Now you might say that is alot I don't think so... It is not like I was out lifting wood or digging up flowers. It was not hard labored work it was just sitting and driving and eating. That is it. But I was so tired that really at the Funeral Home I did not want to leave just wanted to put my feet up and go to sleep. That was not me ever. But now I can't do what I have done before at all. I did go out to Cleveland and those wonderful Doctor's out there basically told me that what is being done for me in Rochester is what they would do and not anything more. I have met a couple of other people that are having the same issues. Some are on a Trach and Ventelator and I am not. Sometimes I think that maybe I should be doing more because I am not as bad as those people. But the other week I had to get up at 5:30 in the morning because my Daughter and her husband own and operate a Dairy Farm so they needed me to watch their daughter my Granddaughter. I got up but on the 2nd day of a 4 day "job" I was like there is not way in hell I could ever do this. I only have her for like 2 hours and she is sleeping for like and hour and a half of that time. I can go back to sleep after she goes home but I still know I could never get up and go out to work and be able to perform any type of job unless it is to test Mattresses and I could sleep on each one for a couple of hours each... I am having my 15 minutes of fame, the local paper here in Livingston County called The Mt. Morris Shopper is doing a 4 week article on me and my condition. I am glad cause I feel that the only way people are going to know anything about my Problem is through the Media. I know some prolly would not agree but if you are having this type of problem we need to pull together and try to get this information out to them. This week I am going to write a letter to my local Senator that I know and see if there is a way for me to speak to Albany here in NY so maybe if I talk to the Polititions they might help get the word out. We will see. Thanks for listening.. If you ever want to talk to me you can e-mail me at cctaft6 @ rochester . rr . com I read my E-Mail's like 2 or 3 times a day. If you have this problem please E-Mail me so I know who you are and we can put our heads together and compair notes too. I am going to make a Support Group page on Facebook. Once I do I will post that Title on here and hope that everyone with this type of problem will come out and join me to help each other out and support each other.... Take care and God Bless you and God Bless the United States of America!

Chronic diarrhea, bloating, cramping.  DIET MATTERS - LIFESTYLE CHANGES HELP.REDUCE STRSS Getting better without all the DRUGS! What are the most current helpful treatments available for these conditions, your disease?  If you have an article, share it.  If you have a treatment that works for you, share that too. We will get better because we do have control on our overall health and can eliminate/reduce inflammation in our body.  There is power in numbers.  When we come together - we have power to overcome and move forward in good health.  The more we know the more power we have!Support and Understanding - Chronic illness is very much misunderstood by people that do not suffer from one, they just don't get it.  People, even your family members, have difficulty wrapping their brains around these conditions/diseases.  There are people that do understand and do experience similar symptoms - You are not alone and can get support and help from people that care.PS: Conventional treatments for Autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions work for some, but really only treat the symptoms.  It's easy to take a pill and continue with the day without a change.  If this makes the pain go away, you think you are better.  For a lot of us, our bodies need more and deserve more.  We need to make a change and step up and do what our body requires of us to get better. We need to listen to our bodies and respond to our needs. It takes effort and requires motivation, will and faith in something more.  **TAKE ACTION TO CHANGE YOUR SITUATION**

detox_from_home_off_methadone_	Detox from Home off Methadone 	Public	 Addiction 	7	If youâre reading this, odds are youâve already made a decision to come off of Methadone. Having kicked Methadone I would like to share how I detoxed myself at home and would like to share my experience and some tipsâ¦that worked for me.The process is difficult. It takes endurance. It takes work. It takes committment. It takes willingness. And that being said, once you've made that decision and follow through on it, I can tell you that what lies on the other side...being clean & knowing that  after you made it through the hardest and most toughest time that you seem you wasn't gonna make it you overcome it and it is well worth any fight you might undergo.Each individual will experience the following to varying degrees dependent upon your time on Methadone, dosage, age, other pre-existing physical and emotional issues. Not everyone will experience each of these side effects. The WD symptoms & PAWS are a waiting game and you have to play it out to end.THEY ARE HOWEVER, A NORMAL PART OF THE PROCESSâ¦JUST NOT PLEASANTWITHDRAWAL & POST ACUTE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMSAnxietyIncrease in blood pressureFeeling that you're jumping out of your skinDiarrheaVomitingSweatingGoosebumpsLeg & back/shoulder painSleep deprivationDehyrdrationDepressionLethargyRapid-fire sneezingRunny eyes/noseUnrelenting coughingNON-ADDICTING COMFORT MEDICATIONSClonodine: BP med (you'll need an RX).

It's emotionally soothing and helps with spasms in back/legsHeating pad on lower back & on calves can helpThe sleep deprivation is probably the longest lasting effects of Methadone WD. It's frustrating, it's anxiety producing and depressing...but you won't die from it.Exercise...lightly in the beginning. You can start by walking. Build up your endorphin/serotonin levels. This will greatly aid with sleep, depression and energy.Keep your goals VERY small to start. Just getting up and showering may tax your energy level. Make sure to eat and drink water.And most importantly,. DON'T QUIT BEFORE THE MIRACLE!

This is a feeling that for me personally has never gone away, although sometimes it's more tolerable than others.  I have come across hundreds of other individuals in my years of research who share in these unique and unexplainable symptoms.  Most often, other symptoms accompany the spaced out feeling such as feeling dizzy, disoriented, off balance, head pressure and various others.  This is a group that will allow us all to interact with each other, share our feelings, ideas, tests we have had, things that have helped, what we know, or what we don't know... basically anything that helps us cope and keep hope in finding answers.

I had two spinal surgeries a year ago and have been in Chronic pain ever since.  I had spinal stenosis and was told that I could be paralysed soon if I did not have a cervical fusion. I was at 78% blockage at that point.OK So since then I have been living a totally dfferent life, a life full of pain, fear, limitations, anxiety, and depression.Right now I have been on Oxycodone 10/325 for a year.  I am up to taking 150 of them per month along with anxiety meds, depression meds, muscle relaxers!!!  18 months ago I barely took an asprin.My question and concerns are that the oxycodone is not working anymore.   I am scared to ask my doctor for anything else.  What I would like to do is replace it wth somethng that will work.   I do not know what this would be and how to ask.  I have recently moved from AZ to CA and have only seen my doctor one time.  My muscles are twitching all night to the point  I can not sleep, my pain is constantly a 6-7 with meds and I can not live like this anymore.Any suggestions for coming off the meds, asking for what will work, help n anyway.  Doc suggestions for the Modesto area would be great tool.I am slipping fast and do not know how much longer I can take it and how to fix it....Thanks for the help,

in_undiagnosed_limbo	In Undiagnosed Limbo	Public	 Digestive 	7	First off I would like to welcome you all to this group. I hope you can find the help and support you need here. I decided to create this because for the past two years I have been dealing with undiagnosed GI problems. Through my search online to find some answers I found a handful of others going through the same things I am, and others with different GI problems. Alas, no answers.I don't know how to be a support group leader but I do know how much it helps to feel like your not so alone in what your going trough. It really helps to have people you can talk to about how awful you feel when your friends and family either don't understand or are too used to you being sick to be as sympathetic as you'd like them to be.I am also new at running a group so feel free to tell me if I'm doing something wrong or if you have any suggestions on how to make this a better and more comfortable place!I really only have one rule; everyone should be 100% respectful of each other. It's true that there is suffering in the world greater than your own, but we all live our own lives and can't always put our own pain in a greater context. Sometimes knowing that it could be worse, doesn't make it any better, and we should all be mindful and respectful of this.

loving_a_angry_child	Loving a angry child	Public	 Children's Health 	21	I am starting this group to find others like me... I am a mother of 2 beautiful boys. My first born child is a smart boy, everyone loves him... He is great with animals, he loves art, and legos.  He is great, until he becomes upset.  His violent/angry behavior started at 4 1/2.  I have tried so many things...  I have made mistakes, regrouped, tried new things...  My husband pointed out to me the other day "It is sad that a good day to you is one in which your child has not hit you".  I would like to hear stories; success, struggles, suggestions...  Very few people have ever seen this side of him.  Two different women whom I spent time in my home with.  I rarely let people visit because of fear of his behavior. He has now struck one of my friends--  His teachers never believe he is capable of such behavior. His grandparents know him to be difficult but not violent. He has started getting very rough with his brother, though his rages are generally directed at me.  I live on my own with them, except the weekends when my husband comes home. It makes for a lonely existance.  I am working on a degree in human services, to go on to Child Psychology (pretty sure).  I just wish I could understand more of what is happening in my own home.  I'd like to talk to more people like me-  (I realize I should have wrote "an angry child" but cannot fix it now... )

males_with_bpd	Males with BPD	Public	 Mental/Emotional Health 	4	BPD is rare in males. Is it? From what we understand, there are no proven clinical results for males with BPD and in fact, past and current research on male BPD has been neglected if not ignored by the psychological community at large. Some research has even dared to eliminate males from its findings. Gender comparisons to BPD as been constantly divided, pointing to some ugly generalizations such as domestic violence, sex offenders and a majority of prison inmates upon the BPD male, thus dividing gender-based distinctions. Our goal for is to enlighten, educate and discover why BPD is rare in males and to solicit the global mental health community to permit more research on males with BPD.Find us on Face Book at https://www.facebook.com/pages/BPD-Males/173062222744287

The group is also about inspiring and motivating ourselves to push boundaries, not in weight loss only, but also in life. If you wait until you're thin before you can live your life to the fullest, then you may never get the chance to live. Start living now! Forget the stress, the self-hatred and the lack of confidence; live and appreciate being alive. Take a bite at one of your "unrealistic" dreams, and maybe just the taste itself will inspire to chase after it. Get out of your "comfort zone cage" and take a moment to live completely. Learn about yourself, understand your body, know how food makes you feel and use what feels good. Don't allow the fabric of life burn you into complete shyness... you're not made of "flammable" paper, you're made of much sterner stuff!!! And while you're at it, break out of the cage that your weight has locked you in... Claim your freedom with a team of people who understand exactly what it is you're going through

medical_tourism_in_india	Medical Tourism in India	Public	 MedHelp General 	2	Medical tourism is basically a practice of going abroad to obtain health care services.There are so many benefits of going abroad from the native country to obtain health services such as lower prices, less wait times and new technological improvements. Many countries are able to offer complete travel packages including airfare, transfers, surgery costs and even post-operative vacation care.Medical and Health Care services in India now are really improved a lot while having a large no. of Hospitals with latest technology equipments.A medical vacation allows you to bring friends and family, provide some post-operative rest and relaxation, often a very high quality of service and care in luxurious accommodations.India has many corporately owned hospitals that do not have the overcrowding issues that many public hospitals have. India's Artemis health Institute performs many operations a year and holds a mortality rate that is less than half that of many U.S. and European hospitals.Now the question arises is that how to promote medical tourism in India?If someone has any idea about how we can promote medical tourism in India please let that apply.Thanks

mitochondrial_disorders	Mitochondrial Disorders	Public	 Rare Diseases 	13	I wanted to start this group for anyone out there who may have been diagnosed with a mitochondrial disorder also. Or maybe just letting people know what this disease is about. It is still just getting known in the medical community so you may have to bring it up to your doctor if you think this sounds like something you have been going through. MITOCHONDRIAL DESCRIPTIONMitochondria are small energy-producing structures found in every cell in the body. They serve as the cells' power plants (responsible for the body's energy production, converting food into energy). It's kind of like having a brown out in your body. Mitochondrial diseases result from failures of the mitochondria, specialized compartments present in almost every cell of the body. They are responsible for creating more than 90 percent of the energy needed by the body to sustain life and support growth. The mitochondria are composed of tiny packages of enzymes that speed chemical reaction. These enzymes play an essential role in turning nutrients into energy: they are linked in the electron transport chain (ETC), also known as the respiratory chain, which creates ATP (cellular energy) through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain is the final step in the energy making process in the mitochondrion where most of the ATP is generated. The mitochondrial enzymes (also known as complexes I, II, III and IV) are needed to generate the electron and proton gradient that is utilized by complex V to generate ATP. Defects in any of the enzymes could cause a mitochondrial disease. When mitochondria fail, less and less energy is generated within the cell. When this happens, cell injury and even cell death follow. If this process is repeated on a large scale throughout the body, whole systems begin to fail, and the life of the person in whom this is happening is compromised, changed or even ended. Currently there are no known cures. The treatments that are available are limited. Most treatments and medications address only symptoms of the mitochondrial disorder, not the disorder itself. Mitochondrial diseases are extremely complex; due to this complexity the severity of these diseases is unpredictable, and the range of symptoms is diverse. Symptoms may present unexpectedly at any age or they may be evident from birth or infancy. The presentation of symptoms depends upon which organs or systems are most affected by the malfunctioning mitochondria. Diseases of the mitochondria cause the most damage to cells of organs and systems that require a great deal of energy: the brain, the heart, the skeletal muscles, the kidney, liver and the endocrine and respiratory systems. The symptoms that I deal with most frequently are Fatigue, Exercise intolerance, Loss of motor control and balance, Muscle weakness, cramps, stiffness and/or spasms, Gastro intestinal disorders, Respiratory complications, Unstable body temperature, Migraine headaches, Visual/Hearing problems, chronically lowered immune system and susceptibility to infection. Add in high mental stress or extremely cold or hot weather and I suffer with seizures or stroke like episodes. I only have so much energy available on a daily basis. Some days I feel okay for part of the day. Some days I get tired just getting ready for the day. I still have to watch how much I do when I do have energy because it does not last long and overdoing will cause me to âCrashâ for days or weeks. When I am in a âCrashâ, I can barely walk from room to room.  The only thing to do to start getting over this is to rest. My doctor said when my eyes no longer focus, thatâs the sign it is time to quit what I am doing and go rest. It's hard to plan ahead since I do not know how I am going to feel from day to day. I was diagnosed in 1999. It has been a long journey so far, and who knows what life lays ahead. But I deal with it day to day. Joyful

neck_nerves_compression	Neck Nerves Compression	Public	 MedHelp General 	7	Some years ago I inquired at this site to help solve a nerve compression problem in my upper neck. The result was that I have a solveable condition for which there is no known surgeon. It is difficult enough to drive 10 hours for a doctor's appointment and be confronted by apathy, terror, and quite possibly ignorance. I say the last item because I am told that my condition is no longer being taught by the medical community. I am at a loss to know where to go next and I am looking for guidance. I have used the category of 'other' because this problem is in-between the professions of ENT, Neurosurgery, Vascular Surgery, and Spinal Surgery.

For decades, our dental industry has known about this, has strongly denounced it and still in nearly 40 years time has not made the public aware.  By the time I found out, it was too late.  I suffer from horrific burning/stinging in my lower left lip and chin.  A friend who I met on the internet suffers the worse problem with a chronic bone infection that has eaten away her upper right jawbone.  She had it rebuilt from leg parts but it continues to erode.  There is no cure for her infection, she has to try to stay one step ahead of it.  We started a website for both the public and dental industry.  Most dentists we have spoken with didn't think it was used any more.  Sadly, it is.

sick_and_tired_of_being_sick_and_tired_	Sick and tired of being sick and tired.	Public	 Digestive 	83	I guess I am looking for a place to go when things get too bad.  I don't know if this is that place, but.... I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, 15% of a liver (need a transplant, and because of the Methadone, I have little if any chance of getting on a list.), Hepatitis C, and am on 100mgs. of Methadone.  I was an addict for 40 years.  But have not used any illicit drug for 35 of those 40 years. I also suffer from severe depression that so far has not been successfully treated with medication. I guess now a lot of you have already judged me, and think that I got what I deserved.  I guess that is why I am writing this.  To see if I can receive some help or, as when I go to a doctor, just be judged for my past. I hope that is not the case because I am told that I do not have a lot of time left on this earth. I am a good man who has always taken good care of his parents and wife and kids.  But, I know that means little to anyone because it seems doctors only see the addiction that I had a long time ago.  Yes, I know I am still addicted to Methadone, but when no doctor will give me anything for for the pain that is caused by the RA, I take my relief where I can get it. If anyone out there is suffering, no matter why, maybe we can talk. To the rest of you that are judges, kiss my a<!

stabbing_nerve_pain	Stabbing nerve pain	Public	 Neurology 	5	I'm new, and have never done the "forum" thing before.  I hope I'm doing this right.I'm 36 yr old female.About 4 yrs ago I woke up to discover that my legs were weak.  It felt like I had bricks tied to my feet.  just over night I went from being active to not being able to get up from a squat, or climb stairs.  Then after a while it turned into muscle spasms, sometimes severe spasms, almost like an alien might climb out of my legs.Also spasms in my eye lids.Now for the last couple years I've been dealing with extreme, and stabbing nerve pain in my feet.  I'm talking about ever 30 seconds, and with no ryme or reason to it.  Finally about a year ago (maybe less) my Dr. gave me a medication (gabapentin).  It's to numb the nerves.  At first I loved it, It really helped.  I think it took about 80% of the pain away, but now I've worked up to the highest dose of this med, and the pain has come back, and is spreading.  I'm starting to see signs of it effecting my hands (the pain, not the meds).  I don't know how to best discribe my symptoms, but I'll try:Stabbing pain, like Nails being hammered into my feet."popping popcorn" in feet and legs.Creepy crawliesIf I scan my body, the only thing I can find that doesn't hurt are my lips.  I am in constant pain!  today I actually fell to my knees in public because of the stabbing pain.Ok, now here is the dillema.  I don't have insurance, so they did just a couple tests and then stopped.  I'm also looking for work, and have no income.  So going to the Dr. is completely out of the question right now.  I don't know what to do.  I can't take this pain!  I'm a tough cookie, but enough is enough!  I just can't stand the pain!  It's constant!  and getting worse every day!Does anyone know what's wrong with me?  I've tried all the stuff like calcium, and vitamin D, and many other things.  Nothing helps!I have diabetes, but they ruled out neuropothy.  I have bad back problems (scoliosis, and bone on bone in about 4 spots).  They thought that might be a cause, but if my back explains my feet and legs, why am I starting to feel it in my hands, and what's up with the constant spasms in my eye lids?Please, can someone help me?  Even just suggestions of what it might be, and then I can research it to see if I can find something that fits my symptoms.  Please Please Please help me!!!  I don't fee like I can go on much longer in so much pain.  Please help!Thank you

The rapid beating of the heart during SVT can make the heart a less effective pump so that the cardiac output is decreased and the blood pressure drops.

annawilliams	Support Anna Williams Heart Surgery	Public	 Heart 	2	My daughter, Anna has spent the last 11 years of her life struggling with every medical condition under the sun from cancer to septic blood infections. For the past year and a half her atrial fibrillation has caused her to be confined to the home nearly every day. She cannot drive, work a normal job, or go out and do anything that a healthy 28 year old woman should be able to do. Her insurance has decided not to cover the Radio Frequency Ablation procedure that she desperately needs to stop the persistent tachycardia and abnormal rhythms. They have deemed it unnecessary as there are drug therapies such as beta blockers and cardiac glycosides that may also control the problem. She has tried all of these drug therapies and they have either done nothing or made her sicker; even causing secondary problems for which she will also eventually need surgery to correct as well. Please help me in raising the funds to help her get back on her feet. With this simple day patient procedure it could give her a new life. With the current condition she has there is a huge risk or heart failure, stroke, and embolism. We would greatly appreciate your help in getting these weighty issues off our minds so that we may move on with our lives. Thank you for your kindness and understanding in advance.http://anna-heartsurgery.yolasite.comThank you and God bless you,Paul and family

I have had such terrible treatment in the last 20 years , not saying that prior to that it was any better , but I am just going to start when I first got clean and sober to be fair. I was treated with Depakote & Effexor for 15 years , and spent a large part of those years in the hospital for suicidal depression , and extreme mania insanity , always to show back up at Dr. Trans office , with the same treatment plan . In 2011 , I had all I could take and demanded to be treated with different meds , as I once was in 1978 , when a doctor  seen me because of the hospitalization of falling while on Lithium and spletting   my head open, Dr.Shore believed I had ADD , and bi polar , and started me on Ritalin for ADD, and Klonipin for mania from bi polar, and for the first time in years , I was free of the cycles and episodes, for over 1 year. In 1979 I started back drinking Alcohol again , and that was that until 1994. I ask for the same treatment plan from Dr.Tran , and after getting 2 other doctors to approve of this plan I went on to have one and a half bi polar free years until for no reason other than her despise , Dr. Tran took me off all bi polar meds and said I no longer had mania problems. In October 1 month from her chance to destroy my life she got her wish come true , I returned in full blown mania , ask to be hospitalized or at least give me meds and was ask to leave, I called again and ask what was i going to do that i was suicidal , and was told i could ask for a different doctor , on December with no one to help me I was put into mental health hospital for the possibility of hurting myself ,  and was put back on my mania meds , and now back to normal once again , can anyone explain why I just spent the last 4 months of my life in hell , and could not get help after 17 years of being seen by this doctor, how for her to try and put her ideas ahead of my safety, I almost lost my life .

viral_myocarditis	Viral Myocarditis	Public	 Heart 	3	I am a 48 yr old male who was diagnosed with viral myocarditis 15 months ago.  My EF at one point was 12% but has since been 55% to 65%.  I have always been very active, a non-smoker, non-drinker, no history of high BP or heart disease, which the doctors attributed my thus-far recovery to.  At present time I am on Coreg CR, simvastatin, 81 mg. 81 mg aspirin.  I was following a low-salt diet at the advice of my doctors but have since been instructed to increase my daily salt intake.  I have had a echocardiogram w/bubble test, stress test, several ultrasounds with results indicating that a heart cath is not necessary.  My questions are 1. Has anyone experienced skin sensitivity around the left side area and some aching in the ribs? 2. Shoulder blade popping, muscle cramping on left side of back and joint discomfort? 3. Does anyone know what a normal recovery time is for myocarditis and is the side pain and shoulder popping/muscle cramping any side effects of this illness? I would like to communicate with others that have had myocarditis.

b6_toxicity	Vitamin B6 Toxicity	Public	 Pain 	37	Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that can result in nerve damage when too much is taken in the form of supplements. B6 is found naturally in most grains such as flax and wheat. Many vitamin supplements and diet pills also contain more than the daily requirements of vitamin B6.B6 toxicity, also known as B6 overdose, is rare and most doctors are unfamiliar with it. It's becoming more common as manufacturers are adding B6 supplements to many vitamins and fortifying cereals.Symptoms commonly include a feeling of pins and needles, like nails being driven into you, generally in your hands and feet or anywhere else in your body where you've sustained nerve damage in the past. However, instead of pain, symptoms may include numbness. Either is refered to as neuropathy. Anytime you eat foods with certain forms of vitamin B in them (B1, B3, B6), your symptoms worsen for many hours. B6 toxicity is usually reversible by avoiding foods with vitamin B in them for 6 months to 3 years.

unknown___hypothyroid__antidepressants_	Unknown! (Hypothyroid, antidepressants)	Public	 Women's Health 	2	name is Brittney and I am a 22 year old female. (I'm short stature- 5 ft and about 120 lbs). I have a problem that has been going on for years. My symptoms include: extreme brain fog and fatigue, difficulty expressing words, overactive bladder (some days I could last 4 hours at a time and others I can't even last 10 minutes...I don't even drink as much water as I should but I go quite a lot), zero sex drive (I don't think I ever had one so I don't even know what it's like to have one...I'm very interested in guys but I don't ever get that sexual desire, and severe stomach cramps (not as much as in the past...I think it's because I haven't been eating as much breads/carbs). I have been on antidepressants since I was about 14 for OCD, anxiety, and mild depression. I started on Paxil on and off for a little while, and then I was put on Zoloft around the age of 18. I was on Zoloft for about two years or so. Then I tried Lexapro for a year. I was diagnosed with hypothyroid at age 18 and have been taking Levothyroxine (50mg) since. I have always been on the generic until just this week I wanted to try the brand name to see if that made a difference at all. My levels are normal but I don't feel normal. I decided to go off of antidepressants all together in July 2011. It has been almost 7 months and I still feel major brain fog and fatigue, constantly having to go to the bathroom, and zero sex drive...Although I think it has increased until I started Prozac last week (I only took it for 3 days and just switched to Bupropion XL 150 mg (generic Wellbutrin). I decided to try something again because I was told my symptoms could be because of depression...but I'm depressed because of my symptoms! I didn't feel any less tired, etc. while on the antidepressants in the past...Since Prozac causes sexual side effects, I didn't want to be on it. I have been to the endocrinologist, gastro, psychologist, urologist, cardiologist, etc...I am going to see a food allergist in 2 weeks. I thought maybe it could be a gluten intolerance...but I was tested for Celiacs last yr and it was negative...I was even tested for Lyme and that was negative as well.
vitamin_d_deficiency_acne_hairloss	vitamin D deficiency acne hairloss	 Private 	 MedHelp General 	1	Hi. i thought i had been suffering from hormonal symptoms for the past 4-5 years, acne, hairloss, moodyness, very irritable and depressed, allergies, the list goes on. i was tested by my integrative doctor adn she says i am very low in vit D, my level was a 4. i was also low in vit. A, magnesium, zinc, calcium, chromium, folate, and she put me on a probiotic. and took me off dairy adn gluten. my acne is worsening now. ive been off gluten for 3 months adn dairy also. i have been taking the vitamins for a little over a month. i have heard people say that things get worse before they get better with taking vitamin d. could this be it. my hairloss is also worsening. my nails are more brittle. i take 10,000 units or whtever a day. i am wondering if the vitamin deficiencies are my cause of my issues or if it could still be hormonal? why are my symptoms not gettting better when im taking all the supplements i am deficient in. the only thing i see any improvement in, i think, is my eyelashes. but everything else is worse. i feel hopeless and depressed. my skin is so oily and covered in acne. has anyone has luck with vitamin d and acne and hairloss? or any vitamins and these symptoms? and if so how long does it take to start seeing and feeling improvements?? i really need support through this. im a 28 year old woman. im suppose to feel great and attractive, but i feel horrible and ugly. its holding me back from living my life and im so tired!!

worried_needsupport	Worried About HIV Support 	Public	 HIV/STDs 	11	This group does not answer questions about your risk, yet we support each other over our fears and try to find ways to calm down and know NO matter what we will be okay. This is a support group for people who are having anxiety issues feeling that they may have been infected with HIV. Some of you are in the window period and waiting for an accurate result. Some of you may have tested negativr, but still think you are showing symptoms and can't believe your test results. This is a support group so we can all come together and support each other. In this time I know how lonely it can be, but KNOW you are not alone.If youâre concerned that you may be entering into an episode of stress depression and anxiety, this support group will be for you. Youâll want to know the psychological symptoms and the physical symptoms associated with these problems and how they affect sufferers. Here are the most common physical and psychological symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety:          Lack of energy. This common symptom is common to stress depression and anxiety and no matter how much you try, you just canât seem to get energized for anything. This affects motivation and so youâre in a catch 22 situation. The less energetic you feel, the more your motivation levels drop. The less motivated you feel, the lower your energy levels become.         Exhaustion. This is major symptom of depression and it is so debilitating. This is a different kind of exhaustion than the exhaustion you feel say after strenuous physical exercise. In depression, the exhaustion is mentally and physically crushing. Even performing simple daily tasks is way too difficult and it doesnât matter how much you sleep, the exhaustion just wonât go away.        Trembling Hands. This is mainly a stress or anxiety symptom. The sufferer may be in such an anxious, fearful state that the body floods with powerful chemicals such as adrenaline. In this state, the brain is in a high status of alert and trembling hands are one of the most noticeable, uncontrollable physical symptoms of stress and anxiety. Until of course, the root cause of these problems is addressed and the trembles will then disappear.        Disturbed Sleeping Patterns: This symptom is common to stress, depression and anxiety and it works in 2 main ways. The suffer will either sleep too much or more likely, will only sleep for a couple of hours a night, maybe even less. In many cases, sleep is disrupted because of vivid nightmares, which some sufferers may not even remember. Other sufferers have recurring nightmares. Although these vivid dreams may cause distress, please realize that it isnât representing anything about you, it is the stress, depression or anxiety that is causing the brain to work overtime and these vivid dreams are a symptom of this, so please donât blame yourself or feel guilty. The nightmares will disappear once stress, depression and anxiety are under control.        Excessive Worry. Among the more common psychological anxiety, depression and stress symptoms, excessive worry means the sufferer worries about even the smallest of lifeâs events. A sufferer will be unable to find positive outcomes to anything and will continually assign negative outcomes to all situations. In continually assigning negative outcomes, life becomes very hard as sufferers are in a fearful state of mind for prolonged periods, a state that harms the body as well as the mind.        Irritable. Irritability is a major stress symptom as anyone whoâs been under severe stress (and most of us have at some point in our lives) will know this all too well. When youâre under stress, you are stretched to your limit and your patience levels are thin. This explains why even the slightest thing can cause a sufferer to lose their temper or be off-handed or curt towards others. And even when the slightest mishap or accident occurs as they do so often during our daily routines, it will fuel the frustration causing more aggressive or nasty behaviour. Again, this is a symptom of stress and the irritability goes away when stress is relieved.       Isolation. Wanting to shut out the world is another major symptom of depression, although stress sufferers can sometimes seek solitude too. Retreating into a solitary, lonely world further pushes the sufferer down the depression spiral â itâs like self imposed solitary confinement â making it even harder for sufferers to find a way out of depression. This is because sufferers feel uncomfortable or even awkward around others and would rather be alone to avoid this feeling.        Panic. This anxiety symptom arises because the sufferer is convinced a catastrophic outcome to an event - or a number of events - in life is imminent. Possible examples could include a wedding, a house move, a work situation, relationship issues, illness, flying, or speaking in public. Sufferers simply cannot change this focus and the more they think about this catastrophe, the more panic stricken they become. Fortunately, there are a number of ways to address this so a person doesnât enter the spiral that leads to panic.        Worthless Feelings. A symptom of depression although stress sufferers may also feel this way sometimes. This is a terrible feeling to have. Sufferers lose all sense of self worth, self esteem plummets and overly critical self-deprecation is performed, adding to the torment. Self confidence erodes away to nothing and at this point, an individual will find no joy in life, including pastimes and activities that previously brought them so much joy and happiness. The good news is that confidence and self esteem are skills that can be re-learned and along with many other skills form a crucial part in treating depression.        Guilt. Another of the psychological symptoms common to stress, anxiety and depression, guilt can be a heavy burden for sufferers because itâs a lose-lose situation: They will feel guilty about things theyâve done or they will feel guilty about things they didnât do. A continual replaying of events accompanied by regrets and âIf only..â causes deep emotional anguish and heaps yet more torment on to an already tormented person. Guilt really is a powerful, destructive but ultimately worthless emotion yet the harm it inflicts on sufferers is immense. Guilt, like many other emotions, can be dealt with very effectively and this is another important skill to master in managing stress, depression and anxiety.        Headaches: Another common symptom of stress, depression and anxiety. This is a physical symptom and in some cases, the headaches turn into migraine, especially for people under severe stress. This is one symptom that shows problems like stress, depression and anxiety arenât âall in your mindâ and clearly demonstrates how stress, depression and anxiety have physical as well as mental symptoms.       Muscle Pain: Mainly a symptom of depression but stress sufferers may also suffer muscle pain. Muscle pain symptoms will typically be backache and leg cramps. These symptoms can be so painful, and a problem is that sufferers will be unaware that the pain is a symptom of depression. Once the depression is controlled, the pain vanishes.       Racing Heartbeat: Not so common with depression, more a symptom of anxiety and stress. Again, the highly-aroused emotional state floods the body with adrenaline and the heart rate rises. This may also cause âbutterfliesâ in the tummy as well.        Loss of Appetite. A symptom common to stress, anxiety and depression, loss of appetite is perhaps one of the most obvious consequences of stress, anxiety and depression because of the emotional state of the sufferer. No one feels like eating when theyâre frightened, panic stricken or feeling worthless and exhausted. There are some sufferers whose appetites have increased dramatically but they are in the minority. Loss of appetite is more common, and reducing food intake further affects energy levels and deprives the body of nourishment, further exacerbating stress, depression and anxiety. Itâs important to note that the causes of stress, depression and anxiety are not rooted in diet and diet alone cannot cure any of them. However, healthy eating does have a part to play, and it should be a part of your stress, anxiety and depression treatment.       Loss of Sex Drive. Just as above, this symptom occurs because of the emotional state of the sufferer. Paradoxically, many people who are depressed can seek emotional re-assurance from sex even though their sexual appetite has decreased. So loss of sex drive doesnât necessarily mean abstinence from sex. This is more common to depressed women than men, as for men, being in a highly stressed, anxious or depressed state can make the physical act of sex nigh-on impossible. For reasons that I hope are so obvious I need not go into any more detail! Again, as with the other symptoms, your sex drive will  return once stress, depression and anxiety have been brought under control.
