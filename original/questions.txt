post_2072065	8	The first onset of dementia was 8 months ago	170	325705	Nov 06, 2007	My Mom is 82 years old and as of June '07 she seemed fine to me.    She sometimes forgot names of people she met, but she recently moved into a lifecare community in FL from Vegas and there were alot of names to remember.    She has chronic UTI infections and she experienced one in June '07 that made her very confused.    She ended up in the hospital where she became paranoid and hallucinated. After 2 weeks in the health center, she went back to her apt. and other than not handling her medication, she went through 2 cataract surgeries and seemed to be coming back.    3 weeks ago she had another UTI infection that caused edema in her feet as it had gotten into her kidneys.    She was in the hospital for 3 days that caused the paranoia, irritability and hallucinations. She has been in the health center now for 2 weeks - on 100 mg of zoloft, aricept, namenda, seraquil and can't walk, is more confused and very irritable to others.    Not her normal personality.    Her neurologist has just taken her off zoloft, aricept and namenda and increased her seraquil to 25 mg 3 times a day (was 25 mg once a day at night).    I am hoping I am doing the right thing for her.    He is a well renowned neurologist and doesn't know what is causing her problems after looking at her EEG, MRI of the brain, Ultrasound of the caratoid artery and CAT scan of the neck.    I believe he thinks it is being caused by the medication.    Anybody have a similar problem with their parent?	7	Namenda	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_2331582	397721	?alzheimers	170	381435	Jan 07, 2008	I have been caring for my 85 yr old grandfather since July, when he was released from a nursing home. He was fine in april (driving, playing golf, going out, etc..) he was diagnosed with a uti and since was put in a nursing home and was in and out of hosp till July.    He began to show improvement and the family decided to take care of him.    Within a few weeks of being home he was walking again on his own and able to take care of himself(for the most part).    He then had a seizure, from his Dilantin level being too low and while in the hosp they did an mri and said he had evidence of an old stroke but nothing recent.    He was released and very slowly began losing motor skills with his hands and legs.    Within the past few weeks he has become very confused, unable to walk without falling and doing small tasks, such as hanging up the phone or trying to pull his pants down to use the bathroom.    He has fallen alot and trying to eat is very hard for him.    He cant pick up the food and get his hand to his mouth.    Seeing this happen has been very upsetting and I cant find the right answer.    It sounds like a litlle bit of a stroke (even though the mri says no), alheimers and/or dementia.    i was hoping i could get another idea.    please help??	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_2242327	380159	when should I consider hospice	170	327789	Dec 17, 2007	My mother (91) is in a memory care nursing home.    I brought her (and my dad who is in assisted living) out to Arizona in May - they were both in a similar facility in New York.    It seems like my moms condition started to decline about 6 weeks after the move.    She has had Alz probably 4 years or better.    My dad did a great job of hiding it.    Recently she has been refusing to eat.    She has lost weight and is weak.    The home suggested getting her evaluated for hospice which I did, and yes she "qualifies".    I had the hospice lady speek with my dad who seems against it.    I think he may feel that she will be relocated to another facility and would not be able to see her - but I am not sure.    He is a man of very few words.    Shortly after the evaluation she began eating again so I did not follow thru with anything.    Now she has stopped eating again the the home is very concerned and once again suggested hospice.    They tell me she would stay right there.    I do have a meeting with the social worker tomorrow to discuss her care plan.    I feel as if by my moving her maybe I caused the decline.    I also don't want to initiate anything to upset my dad.    My mom did sign a health care proxy many years ago and stated that if she were to have an irreversible physical or mental disease that she be allowed to die peacefully.    Has anyone been thru this or can anyone offer suggestions?	5	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_2332406	397870	Mom has Alzheimer's and Parkinson's	170	381593	Jan 08, 2008	My mom was diagnosed with Parkinson's about 4 years ago.    She was recently told that she is at the beginnings of stage 3 of Alzheimer's as well.    Recently she has been having blackouts and loss of time.    Her longest loss of time was 6 hours.    She did things during this time such as getting dressed, going to McDonald's to eat, then to a Christmas Lights show and then back home.    The last thing she remembered was getting her coat and gloves before she left the house.    She doesn't remember eating at McDonald's but she remembered some of the Christmas lights, and she doesn't remember going home and eating dinner.    The doctor's have ran all kind's of test and they think the blackouts have nothing to do with Parkinson's or Alzhiemer's.    They want to do an MRI but she can't have one done because of an implant she has in her side that has wires running up her spine into the base of her brain.    They say the implant will cause an overload of electrical surges that may or may not kill her.    Have you heard of anyone with these time losses or blackouts that have Parkinson's or Alzheimers and if so were they part of these diseases or were they diagnosed with something else?    We are at a loss and we are afraid that she may become a danger to herself if she has more of these.	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_2143076	358936	My Mother	170	343912	Nov 25, 2007	My Mother is 90 years old.    Her memory has been slipping for some time now.    However, today it took a drastic turn for the worst.    She called me and wanted to know where my father was.    She divorced him years ago and he has been deceased for years.    She denies that she has lived with her significant other for 13 years.    She also tells me that I never call her, I call her every day and spoke with her last night.    She said she wasn't home that she was with her Mother, who is also deceased.    She gets angry and says that she doesn't know what is going on and that everyone is not telling her the truth.    I know an evaluation needs to be made.    How do I proceed with that.    I can call her family doctor, but not sure how soon something can be done.	4	Exelon	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_2283299	388264	Alzheimer?	170	342507	Dec 27, 2007	The doctors say my aunt has alzheimer, from one day to the next she got so bad, I think maybe she had a stroke or something,    She refuses to eat, she repeats the same word, over and over,like 100 times in a few minutes,    she doesn't talk and has to be on oxygen all the time, they say oxygen isn't getting to the brain.    I don't know, i never knew anyone with this disease.    Can anyone tell me if this is the norm for someone with Alz?    Does this mean she is going to die soon, since the doctors are saying we should "keep her comfortable"?    Any help would be appreciated.

post_2262174	383978	Please Help !!!!	170	359370	Dec 21, 2007	My father has never had any health issues other than high blood pressure and gout. He is 64. Last Saturday my mother started noticing sometime slower than normal speach and some confusion. On Monday he forgot how to do PST at work, he is an accountant. On Tuesday it took him 1 hour to do a 5 minute invoice. Apparently not remembering where on the computer to go and how to do it, confussed. Wednesday he forgot his pin number for his bank card, the same 4 digits he has used since bank cards came out. He knows his name, the date, where he lives, who we are. He just seems to be forgetting how to do work related and number related things. It is taking a toll on both my parents and my father is getting tired and discouraged. Could this be beginning Alzheimer's? There is NO family history at all! Can it happen this fast? Could it be something else?Please help, any advice is appreciated.	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Diffusion imaging is unremarkable. The pituitary is not enlarged. The paranasal sinuses appear satisfactory.Some scattered minimal foci of hyperintense signal can be seen in the peripheralsupratentorial white matter on FLAIR axial imaging.Differential diagnosis is minimal microvascular disease versus vasculitis. A demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis is listed in the differential diagnoses, but is considered unlikely. The presentation is atypical for this. No other findings."Thank You !!!!!!

post_2145451	359499	Ehlers-Danlos	146	328145	Nov 26, 2007	I have Ehlers-Danlos III.    My mother was diagnosed with fibromyalgia and my daughter clearly has a case of Ehlers-Danlos III.    So we think my mother (deceased) had    EDS III.    Amongst an array of symptoms that fit into the EDS III category, she had MVP but it wasn't diagnosed until after the birth of her 6th child and was never an issue during pregnancy or childbirth.My question is this, can cardiovascular problems develop as an EDS'r III ages?    Ido understand that in a study between a Cincinnati clinic and the NIH (ODonnell), that approx. 20% of a group of EDS'rs (II & III) were identified to have CV involvement.    But from the literature, I can't find if there is a risk for development of CV involvement as an EDS'r ages, more specifically an EDS III patient.     From my experience with geneticists, I've learned that sometimes there isn't solid science on a matter however there is a suspicion of something common to this group ....but this is only through observation and they relay it as so.Any suspicions or science on CV involvement in the aging EDS groups besides the one with expected CV problems (is that IV?)	9	cardiovascular,mvp,ehlers-danlos,symptom	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

It is a disease incompatible with life, and my husband and I are entirely asymptomatic, pointing to an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, which is not confirmed by the medical community as of yet.The few familial cases of PPH that exist in the literature point to consanguinity. My husband and I are not remotely related. And because three out of three children have been affected, we have our doubts about the mode of inheritance (in our particular case).I am currently three and a half months pregnant via a sperm donor; I conceived this baby before learning of gonadal mosaicism. I am now sick with worry thinking I am the asymptomatic carrier, with a high volume of mutated cells in my ovaries.I was wondering if you could tell me the following: just based on odds, in a case in which three out of three children are effected with a familial condition that is EXTREMELY rare, and both parents are unrelated, would an autosomal mode of inheritance still be a more likely mode of inheritance, or is this a good indication gonadal mosaicism is more likely?

post_2134527	356916	School Project	146	341627	Nov 22, 2007	[cross posted to Teen Health]I have a school project, and we could choose from a very large amount of topics, and then get fairly creative with the project. Anyway, here is the question. I have done some research, and it seems that a person's (male) height, weight, penis size, testes size, definition of facial features, along with many other "manly" features are dependent not only on genetics, but levels of testosterone. SO, my theory was that even if a teenager is developing "normally" if they took testosterone supplements then all of the above listed "features" could be increased, such as height -- as long as bone plates have yet to fuse, penis size, male sex drive, etc, etc. Have any studies been done to support said theory? If not, would this hypothetically be at all feasible?

post_2111307	351629	I wonder if you can help me...	146	90270	Nov 16, 2007	It has been suggested by at least one doctor that I have a channelopathy of sorts. I will give you a run down as to what is going on with me. 5 years ago, I began to experience breathing issues, specifically shortness of breath with exertion. After tests were performed, specifically PFT's (low MIP, MEP MVV which indicated neuro muscular problem) , an EMG (was unremarkable then, but as years have gone by, they are abnormal...myopathy patter?), diaphragmatic fluroscopy (very abnormal...little mov't bilaterally) and several labs as well. I went from being placed on oxygen to oxygen and bipap to being ventilated full time 3 years ago due to chronic respiratory failure. I do have some muscular issues...my upper body is much weaker than my lower at this time, I can do stairs (after w orking with my legs extensively) but with difficulty. Some doctors have noted temporal atrophy as well.I have had genetic testing for myotonic myopathy..negative, have had muscle biopsies...non diagnostic. I do have other respiratory issues, mild bronchiectasis with heavy bacterial growth (most noteably b. cepacia, s. aureus and the like), digestive problems (pancreatic insufficiency) and DM type II. The docs did do a genetic profile for CF, from what I read is that I have one copy of M470V and 7T/11TG...(I just read that the other day in her office...there has been so much confusion with this), I also had sweat testing which were 48 and 50 respectively (docs also say that my chloride was higher than my sodium...reverse of what normal people are). I am treated as "clinical"    CF with chest physio, nebs and enzymes.It is because of these sweat test results, pancreatic insufficiency, neur issues (mainly diaphragmatic failure) that some docs question whether a channelopathy is at play..?    Perhaps chloride?? I guess that is what I am asking you..I have been wracking my brains, researching this stuff and not coming up with much. I am also guessing this is because it is a realitively new field that is finally being explored    with more channelpathies being discovered.I just want to tie this together somehow...clearly something isn't right here. I was 32 years old when I had to be placed on a vent full time and docs still don't understand exactly what happened...I have even been called crazy, muchausen's (yeah, I must be really good at faking ABG's and the like...!!) because docs simply don't understand. Please shed some light on this..I am sorry if any of this sounds jumbled. There is just so much to this story, it is very difficult to summarize it to a few paragraphs.

Now that I'm starting a family, I would like to know more about it and any possible complications that it may cause in newborns.The only problem is that I'm fairly screwed up genetically, so I don't know what things are related to this syndrome, and what may be standard inherited genetics. The main symptom, as the name may suggest was preauricular tags. I have multiple on each ear.Here is a list of descriptions, and hints, not all may be related to this.Preauricular tagsDouble jointed fingers and kneesApparently high rate of miscarriage or still born due to problems with heart and lungs (anecdotal from my mother)Migraines during youthAsthmaSevere allergies and/or sinus problemsNo mental retardation (some people have said I was the smartest person they knew, but I'm in the South, so take it with a grain of salt).Deformed teeth (my canines have grown out higher up and look like fangs, one dentist had said I had too many teeth, and the space behind them looks like a missing tooth).I think that's it, some of those may not be related to the disorder. If anyone can figure out what this "Ear tag syndrome" my mother was referring to could be, or even a web resource that may allow me to research it, I'd appreciate it.	1	Genetics,Preauricular	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2041586	335710	Hermaphrodite???	146	317485	Oct 29, 2007	Hello, I find this completly and totally embarrassing to ask. But I think I could possibly be a hermaphrodite. I am 16 years old, and honestly, I wouldn't know any of the symptoms because I know my body, but I don't think I know well enough to tell. I will state what I think are my symptoms.I found this a concern when I started to masterbate more. Exploring my insides I mean. I am a virgin of course, and not 3 inches into me there is a lump like form it is slightly hard but I am unsure of what it is. It is very short, not like a penis at all really. Then, I am also aware that anal sex the walls of the vagina are very thin and connected and maybe currently right below this formity, I am feeling two small ball-like shapes, it could just be 'waste' I assume. I am just wondering if this could be normal. If not, I am scared to death.I have a normal period, breast formation and everything else puberty wise is normal. I am a woman, but this is something I am concerned with.

The memory problem: I can attend and event, a lecture, and the like.    Be quite focused, attentive, understanding, but afterword can remember little more than what subject matter was covered.    Too, experiences during the day, when recollected, seem discrete and unconnected - i.e., can't quite recall when such and such happened or whether it was today or yesterday.

post_2292345	390027	Dementia ??	1428	254172	Dec 30, 2007	At age 53,my now 69 yr old husband had surgery for a benign brain tumor located between the the two frontal lobes of the brain requireing Laser Surgery. At that time he was told because of the heat generated in getting all of the tumor, he might at some later date, have some memory loss.    He has continued to work but in the last two years has noticed problems with memory. The work he    does    /did is detailed and requires concentration and memory. More recently, when in a stressful situation (not job related ) he became confused,unable to get facts straight/sorted out.    He also has a hard time making decisions.    He was abt. this same time    diagnosed with Chronic HBP and is on Lisinopril which is controlling it and seems to be helping. Fearing a return of the Tumor we consulted his Surgeon, had an EEG done, saw a top    Neurologist in our area, were prescribed Ativan &    Resperdal by two different doctors, neither of which he could tolerate. In fact he felt the Resperdal made things worse. From what the Drs. told us , at this time there is no sign of Tumor or Seizures or- they say- Dementia/Alzheimers.Could this spell of confusion have been a TIA ?    About    20 years ago, he had a spell of temporary l loss of sight in one eye, and tests showed his BP extremely high at that time. He was given a shot and sent home. The next day the Dr. told me " I thought he was going to have a Stroke right in the office ". He tried meds to control it at that time but could not tolerate the meds.In all of these Dr. appts, he was never given a complete Physical Exam, nor were any tests done to check for blockage in arteries etc. Lab work ruled out Hypoglycemia ..He was told that HBP of long standing could affect memory.I guess my question is--just because Dementia was not found now, does that mean it will not show up in the near future.    From reading I've done it seems that heat generated by Lasix may " seal off " the brain cells causing problems ???Since we did not recieve any answers defineing the problem, I would appreciate your comments.thanks,    Junie 37	3	None	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

post_2670291	470705	In denial.........	170	455605	Mar 20, 2008	I have looked for a forum that was patient based and all I can find are ones for caregivers, so I'll share my thoughts with you guys and maybe you can tell me if those you care for are going thru the same thing.Do the patients have head rushes?    The head rushes is what started everything in 1992.    Experienced them again in 94 and 96.    2002 saw them escalate to the point I became disabled.    In 2006 I was diagnosed with Alzheimers.    I was put on meds that almost killed me.    I experienced rapid weight loss, became weak and feeble, horrible head rushes, loss of balance, loss of motor skills, horrible nightmares, inability to sleep, inability to think clearly.    Those are the main ones I can think of.    I tried to explain to the doctor what I was experiencing and was told I most likely had a virus and to not stop taking the meds.    I tried for almost a month to stay on them, then stopped.    Ironically, everything went back to normal with the exceptions of the head rushes, which the doctor had said were mini seizures.The head rushes bring on the depression.The head rushes bring on the anger.The head rushes bring on poor balance.The head rushes bring on poor concentration and inability to perform.The head rushes bring on limited motor skills.I keep trying to figure out what part of that the neuro-dudes, as I affectionately call them, don't understand.If there are meds for grand mal-seizures, then why not for mini seizures?I have come to believe that Alzheimers is a blanket diagnosis given to we, the elderly, when doctors basically don't have a clue.    Alzheimers, as currently defined, pretty well covers everything we might experience as we age.    Doctors use us day in and day out as test subjects on behalf of the drug industry.    You don't think so?    Ever heard this?    Doctor says, "Try this med, and if it doesn't work, we'll "try" something else."    With TRY being the definitive word here.    TRY is basically an experiment.    If something doesn't work, then TRY something else.That theory is fine until it comes to the human body.The neuro-dudes can't tell me why I'm still articulate, still have the ability to operate complicated software used in graphics arts and the world of publishing or the most important question of all......    why I know.    I know when I've made a mistake and know how to correct it.    I know when the head rushes are getting ready to start.    I know that they last for days at a time.    I know when my words are wrong and immediately correct them.Let me hear from you guys please as to whether the ones you care for are experiencing the same things, perhaps it will better help me accept this or to continue to fight it.	22	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_2675470	471728	I am a caregiver .. Sometimes giving care is frustrating!	170	456995	Mar 21, 2008	Hello! I am a caregiver for an elderly gentleman with Alzheimers.    He is an 88 year old gentleman who is at the end of stage 2 (from what I understand), and I was hired on as a caregiver working 3 days a week. I have been working for this family for about 6 or 7 months now. While I have had a great deal of experience in the caregiver type position (I used to teach pre-school, I also used to work at a treatment center for addictions), I have never had experience with Alzheimers Disease.    I am finding my ability to give care is becoming increasingly more difficult.    I, myself, am dealing with health issues (autoimmune disorder) and the health issues of my mom (kidney & liver failure),    I have also recently started school.    Clearly, I am stressed.    BUT ... I don't think it should be *this* stressful.    I work for a family who is very overextended - trying to juggle their lives, their home (on the opposite side of town), their animals - and are now living with him, juggling his life, his house, his dog, his finances..    It is truly a mess, and I continue to get frustrated because having an objective viewpoint I can see how un-necessarily unmanageable everything is.    They refuse to put him in any type of assisted living (he doesn't want that and made a promise), but at the same time - doesn't there come a point where something has to happen? Like an intervention? There is so much going on, he is not receiving the care he needs, and how often he needs it (doesn't get daily showers, and is now eating/drinking so little that he has been dehydrated and had mid-day blood sugars as low as 39, he has an untreated foot fungus, and he's given choices in which he makes bad choices because he's not capable of making good ones, but its at the expense of others, mostly the health of the pets).     I have really tried voicing my opinion, but very little is done, and everyone's health (mental and physical) is just overextended (including the pets).    I try to keep myself out of it as much as possible, but at the same time I feel angry that I am a part of all of this (and guilty for feeling this way, I mean what do I know - I don't know anything about Alzheimers, I just work for them 3 days a week to give them a break, the family is really good to me... Is it even my place to be feeling this way? Am I justified, or just overreacting?)*Sigh* Well, thanks for listening.	4	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I've been fascinated with selegiline for months now. It sounds like the perfect drug. I study at Yale and have a very busy life, and an active sex life as well. I've researched a LOT on selegiline and it looks like this could help me a LOT. I also read somewhere though that it is recommended only for people above 30. I was wondering if there would be any problems if I used this drug, not on a daily basis, but during the intense times at college.

My teenage daughter decided 2 years ago that she wanted to go vegetarian and I started using more soy to make sure she was getting enough protein. Lately, I decided maybe I'd join her to get a little healthier, etc. and I had someone just recently tell me that eating too much soy can lead to Alzheimers. Has anyone else ever heard of this? Should we not eat soy? My friend who told me this said she read this in a book and that they did a study, etc. Has anyone else ever heard of this? Now I'm not sure what to think. I thought soy was supposed to be good for you. It's just a little bean! Anybody know? I'd appreciate more information on it if anybody knows.

post_2649129	466256	How do I confront him?	170	450618	Mar 15, 2008	Hey everyone!I'm 32yo female, and something's up with my 65yo father. There's alcoholism, NPD, and OCD, but it looks like he's getting Alzheimer's as well. So far he's still living on his own, being "independent". I've been watching after him, but recently, with these funny Alzheimer's issues, I cannot be sure he (or his surroundings) are safe if he's not supervised 24/7. A doc here told me to keep sharp objects out of my father's reach, but I can't do it as all of my involvement is framed as support, advice, or, in the worst cases, threat to remove privileges. But he's still a free person, having choices.Now I need to confront him with the need to get evaluated, thus a chance of supervision, and, considering alcoholism and NPD, this would be a tough discussion. I myself am in no danger, I'll surely get a backup before I approach him with it. But I don't want to make it harder on him than it has to be, and I want to be successful: to get him to agree to be evaluated, to make it to the appointment, etc, whatever comes next, I don't know how it works when people can't manage on their own and someone gets to control them.I know I must be sounding bad: I don't even have a diagnosis, and already want him locked up. As if that was all I cared about. Yet he's literally dangerous to himself and others, this is the main issue, I want to ensure everybody's safety. I raised the issue a few times, suggestively, and got a strong refusal (Do you dare to say I'm insane?!!!).How do you confront them for the first time? How do you get them to cooperate with docs? I understand they do get angry even without alcoholism and NPD, so it must be a tough discussion for all. How did it go with you? What did you do? What happened? What do you wish you've done differently? What proved to be a good decision? How did your parent react?Thank you very much!!!	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_2415369	415932	Rapid memory loss	170	400415	Jan 26, 2008	My mother-in-law is a very active 66 years old.    She had a particularly busy and stressful past year along with a number of funerals of close relatives.    Up until Xmas she seemed like her usual self with the exception of seeming more opinionated.    Within the last 4 weeks she has lost most of her short term memory and some of her long term memory.    The other day my wife phoned to say hello and was not reconized, (this seems really odd to me as my wife and my sister-in-law are twins and no one can tell them apart when they are on the phone).    My sister-in-law has taken her to a psychiatrist, a doctor, and had a CAT scan done.    The diagnosis is that it is the onset of a form of dementia and unlikely to improve.    One problem I have is that besides being 3000 miles away, my sister-in-law is close to being a hypochondriac and had numerous real or imaginary problems.Is it normal or likely for this type of regression to happen in 4 weeks?Could a memory loss be triggered by excessive mental stress?	2	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_2575681	450600	Advice needed on caregiving	221	213044	Feb 28, 2008	My wife and I have been living with her mother for four years now.My FIL dies four years ago, and my MIL depended on him to do everything for her. She hasn't been shopping in fifteen years, and only leaves the house to see doctors or get her hair done. This by her own choice, and really boils down to laziness.She is 83 now, and her attitude is "I worked hard all my life (about fifteen years, actually), and now I want to do what I want to do".What she wants to do is lay in bed twenty two hours a day and have meals on a whim. Her husband catered to that desire for several years, and my MIL was often sick and bedridden because she was eating at odd hours and her medication schedule was completely messed up.He finally died prematurely from trying to care for her, and we took over. Since she gets around with a walker, it was not possible to move her in with us, so we moved in with her.The first thing we did was put her back on three meals a day, with snacks as wanted or needed. She hated that, and it is still a daily point of contention.She takes heart meds, SEVERAL pain pills, vitamins, and other meds I haven't paid enough attention to know about. The point is, most of her meds require food at the same time. If she is eating regular meals, it is much easier to give her the meds at the proper time and in the proper way.Her health has improved tremendously since being put back on a routine. However, she has started to develop dementia, and her short term memory is very bad.She has the most annoying tendency to look for the bad in everything. If it's a cloudy day, she wonders about the impending storm. If it's a sunny day, she wonders about the impending storm. if she asks about the grandkids, it always progresses into the negative, annoying, depressing things. "Is she a good wife? (No) When will they get married? Does she cook for him?She looks for the bad in EVERYTHING, and then fleshes it out until I get quite annoyed. If we try to turn the conversation positive, she changes the subject and finds something else inoccuous to go on about how terible it is.She loves current events, because there is always some tragedy to    discuss. Every time some girl comes up missing it is a week of tongue clicking and speculation. The war, any war. Hillary Clinton. She hates her, and obsesses about what would happen if she gets elected. On and on and on.It sounds like I am bitter and totally unfit for my role in helping her, but all the negativity is getting very stressful. The fact that she forgets she has covered the same agravating Hillary rant twice today already does not make it any easier to listen to again.We are supporting her financially as well as caring for her. My wife does all the cooking, cleaning, bathing, etc., and her mother spends most of the day lying in bed watching TV. She could help a little, but she doesn't want to.Needless to say, she is not getting any exercise, and after almost three years of trying to get her to do simple exercises to keep her muscles from atrophying, we have given up.The reason I am posting this thread, ironically, is my concern for my wife. The stress that is oozing from my fingertips right now is nothing compared to what my wife is feeling.She wants to do what is best for her Mother, but the last four years have aged my wife considerably. She is getting less and less tolerant of her Mother's unwillingness to do anything that is good for her, and every meal turns into an argument about whether her Mother ate two bites, or three bites. Her mother acts like a child, and my wife treats her like one.This is not the way it should be. It is not the way it has been. But it is the way it is now.I act as a buffer and that helps, but the way my wife is reacting lately is not good, and she does not even see it happening. She needs more than time out with the girls or a weekend away. She needs a support group or something.She has spoken with someone at Human services, and someone from Hospice, and is going to be attending a support group for people who have lost their parents, but I'm not sure that is going to bear fruit.She has realized of late, and expressed to me, that she is angry at her Mother for killing her Father, which surprised me but also made perfect sense. Maybe the support group will be able to help her work that out.I'm not sure why I'm posting this.Maybe I'm looking for a support group?I could post three more posts this long to explain the entire situation, and maybe I will.Just looking for someone to talk to, I guess.	28	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_2709593	478706	new to this group	221	301044	Mar 29, 2008	Hello everyone, i am new to your group and am hoping i can help you and that you can help me. Like most of you, i was thrown into the caregiving position by accident. car accident, that is. my husband was on his way home from work a few years ago. A driver with a horrendous driving record slammed into the back of his car, forcing him into oncoming traffic where he was broadsided and hit head on, leaving him with permanent damage to his brain, respiratory and skeletal systems. (driver suffered broken rib). I know this sounds horrible, but i think all of us, including him, would have been better off had he not survived.I am 45 now and am so tired and resentful. sometimes i want to punch the surgeons who were patting themselves on the back for his so-called "recovery." (I have sinse learned that "recover" does not mean you get back to where you started pre-accident or illness, but is a point where you no longer qualify for 24/7 "professional" medical care.)I must be honest. I have immense family, friend and community support. Had I not, i think our son and I would be doing significantly worse. I am very grateful for their kindness. My husband needs constant supervision and attention. I feel for him because I believe he is cognizant enough to realize that things are not what they were. I feel drained and exhausted. I am hoping there is someone here who can identify with me. I was reading the post on "touchingm" and that resonated with me. I just had my hair done about a month ago and a high school girl washed my hair. I felt like i was in heaven, when I realized she, this young stranger, is the first person to lay hands on me in more than 2 years. I could go on and on. I look forward to hearing back from you.Also, I have been thru the ringer, health, disability and auto insurance, legal battles, court fees, etc. perhaps my experiences will help some of you. I am very happy to do so, very truly, cosmo23	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_2746323	486137	I am intrigued about my sons condition and treatment.	221	472634	Apr 06, 2008	About four years ago while hospitalized for a psych evaluation after he had went to the ER for alcohol poisoning the doctor their diagnosed him with schizoaffective disorder. He was prescribed Haloperidol but he never took it and ended up in jail two months later after crashing his car into a persons fence. He lost his job and began drifting around the streets living in dope houses as he later told me before me and my husband finally got him into outpatient commitment. Now they have him on his medication in a time released 2 week form but he complains that the drugs are damaging his brain and making him feel like hes being tortured and he continues to claim that he doesn't have any illness at all. Our doctor told us that the side effects of the medication can cause anxiety so he prescribed restoril, cogentin, elavil and lamictal to go with it and claims his inability to understand his illness is something called anosognosia or however its spelt. The medication seems to be working fine except that he's basically a zombie. It's like he's not my son anymore and I asked the doctor if he could lower the dosages or try some other medications but the doctor claims that he would just stop taking them again if he were able.Are these pills just knocking his brain out or are they treating a medical disease?	2	schizoaffective,Schizophrenia,anti psychotics,medication,side effects,mental illness	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_2761594	489300	Help for ALL caregivers	221	465121	Apr 10, 2008	To: Everyone interested in this subjectI posted this infomation on a specific post, but then realized ALL caregivers need this information.    I cut and pasted my original information and started this new thread.First of all, know that I am an Occupational Therapist who works in home health and deal with this problem EVERY single day.    At the same time, I was a caregiver for my father for 6 years and now my mother for the past 12 years.    I have MUCH empathy and personal/professional experience that I could write non-stop for 24 hours per day 7 days a week and 365 days a year, but I won't bore you.    I'll keep this post short and highlight some pointers.Often times, people get caught up by trying to be good doers and quickly get in over their head.    The people we take care of have rights, but so do caregivers.    It usually comes down to power and control issues.Know:1) You must set clear boundaries as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.    Once set, there are no room for give and take.2) It's important to ask for help instead of trying to do everything yourself.    If other family members are involved and not pulling their share, then you must be specific in asking for help AND delegating specific tasks.3) If your spouse is involved everyone helping MUST be on the same page for the benefit of your relationship.    So, the two of you NEED to talk and agree on the situation at hand.NOTE:    Don't forget to make a date with your spouse to keep your relationship healthy, even if it's a date for a cup of tea and the ONLY goal is to focus on one another.    Also important for this to be non sexual or the main caregiver will feel this is ONE more thing they must do. I promise the intimacy will benefit if you do this.4) It's OK to say NO to unreasonable behavior and NOT feel guilty over setting limits especially if the person can't set it for theirself.5) Pick your battles carefully.    Choose over standing for the important things and let the non important things go for another day.    Usually, it's the no-important things that drive us absolutely nutz.6) Start slowly in making changes to benefit YOU.    Rome wasn't conquered in a day.    Start with one task at a time and the next day do a little more.7)    It's OK to ask for outside help with specific tasks, but this means you must let go and let someone else do the task..8) There is a book called the 36 hour day written specifically for caregivers.    It's a must have to read.9)    Most states have a respite care program.    Check with county/state/local aging centers for information.10) If the situation is so out of hand and you truly have had it, then talk to the doctor and put it in his/her hands.    If the doctor says this must be done, then it's out of your hands and it MUST be done.    Let the person be mad at the doctor and talk to them.    Know health care professionals deal with this ALL the time.    It really helps if we know that the caregiver wants intervention.    It's even more important that the recommendations be followed up if you seek our help.11) Learn how to unarm a power struggle before it becomes an issue.    There is much literature on the net and local library.I'll take my own advice and start slow with my suggestions.    Try these 11 things first, let me know how it goes.    I'll check back often now that I've found this site.Good luck,Reirei	8	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

Little sister has stepped up to the plate once again to offer more help. She has offered to take mom to Europe this fall if mom is in good enough health, because this may be her last mobile year. Portable oxygen concentrators are the latest travel help on the market, and sister will drag along her hubby to act as mule for mom's shopping.Also, sister is paying for two big rounds of housecleaning while I am gone this summer, so that mom won't be living in piles of dust and dog hair, and I'll come home to a reasonably clean house. And sister brainstormed on more ways to make things keep working. Just knowing somebody is out there helping keeps me going.It will become more important in a few years when mom loses more ground, but for now I feel so much better.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

The medical society tells him to, well, tough it out for at least another 6 months. If I was depressed for two weeks straight, I could be considered clinically depressed. So why can't he get help with his grief and depression. It is a situational depression but so much depression is instigated by a traumatic situation. What gives here? Isn't this a bit prejudicial?

post_2669760	470589	helping husband	221	442082	Mar 20, 2008	Advertising DisclaimerMy husband has COPD along with other issues relating to auto immune disorders. He has lost a significant amount of weight and looks much like a skeleton. It is scary to see how thin he is - I honestly have a hard time looking at him.I can not get him to eat. I purchased Boost that he drinks instead of eating while I had in mind that he use it to increase his daily calories. So he is only getting about 900 calories a day with his 3 boosts a day and that is all he eats or drinks. The doctors prescribed marinol but that does not seem to help.I just don't know what to do anymore. He is wasting away. I do not understand how he is just not wanting to try when I need him so much. I do not want to nag him all of the time, but I am tired of preparing meals to just throw them away. I am getting very depressed and am not going to be much of a caregiver like this. I just want him to want to help himself a little. But I can not make a grown man eat. He says he has not given up, but it looks like it to me.Does anyone have any advice?	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_2765497	490049	Frontotemporal dementia and surgery	1465	477043	Apr 10, 2008	I am looking for information on dementia and surgery. My dad needs knee replacement surgery but he was recently diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. I'm in Kathmandu, Nepal (3rd world country) and most doctors cannot tell me how it may affect my dad. Went to a neurologist and he says go ahead with knee replacement surgery since it might increase his quality of life. But he says dementia might get worse because of the stress from surgery and might be permanent but that's the risk. I don't know if the risk is worth taking. Right now, his memory has gone downhill but the most drastic thing is his speech. He cannot communicate well; has difficulty finding the right words to form a sentence. He recognizes people and the condition is still bearable. I don't want to put my dad at risk but he cannot walk because of the weakness (advanced arthritis). He is not in pain, he says. He is taking neurocetam 800mg, 3 times a day as prescribed my the neurologist but he says he might only improve a little bit. I know no one can tell me exactly what the best option is but any advise will be appreciated. Thank you...Junkirri***@****	0	Dementia and Surgery	None

post_2637449	463788	choroid plexus cysts and echogenic intracardiac focus	146	448852	Mar 13, 2008	Hi, I am currently 23yrs old.This is pregnancy number 4. I have had one termination, one miscarriage and a live birth in August 2007.I am now 19 weeks pregnant.I had my ultrasound yesterday and this is what the report said:A single live foetus in cephalic presentation. Liquor volume is within normal limits and the placenta is anterior and clear of the internal cervical os. Bilateral small choroid plexus cysts are demonstrated. A isolated intracardiac echogenic focus is also present in the left ventricle. No morphologic abnormality is demonstrated. No Morphologic abnormality has been shown. Measurements are as follows:BPD: 45mmCH: 162mmAC: 142mmHL: 28mmFL: 29mmHeart Rate: 139bpmNasal bone: 6mmCerebellum: 19mmCisternamagna: 3mmNuchal Thickness: 3mmThe chord has three vessels.Conclusion:Measurements are appropriate for gestational age of 18weeks 6days. EDD 7/8/08.Choroid plexus cysts and echogenic intracardiac focus may be associated with chromosomal anomaly. Background risk for aneuploidy based on maternal age would be low and it remains low despite these findings.    The nasal bone is also noted to be of normal length.    This also reduces the lilelihood of chromosomal anomaly specifically down syndrome.    No nuchal translecency assessment is available.    No morphologic abnormality has been shown and the intracardiac focus has no bearing on cardiac function or morphology.Could you please explain what all of this means?!Is my baby ok?	7	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2660230	1	1 in 44 risk facotr for Trisomy 18	146	453959	Mar 18, 2008	I am here looking for support. I had a sequental (sp?) screening done and the 2nd part came back suggesting I have a 1 in 44 chance of having a child with Trisomy 18. Is that high? How accurate are these kinds of blood tests? I am horrified and have been looking up info on it since I found out a couple of hours ago. The Dr. office cannot get me in until Monday, so needless to say I am walking on pins and needles. I don√¢ Ä ôt understand the kind of test this is. I have looked up info online, but some of the readings are confusing to me. For example, one stated this sort of test detects 90% of children with Trisomy 18. Is this true? I am due on Aug. 22, which makes me about 17 weeks. The nurse said I should have an amnio done, but isn√¢ Ä ôt an amnio done about 16 weeks? And, maybe I should have another ultrasound done to look for physcial features? I really need some advice. I cannot stop crying and I just don√¢ Ä ôt understand this. If they didn√¢ Ä ôt have this kind of test, the first part would have been the only test done, which would have came back fine. Now, they do a 2nd part and tell me something might be wrong with my child. What if I have the amnio done and nothing is wrong but it later causes problems with my pregnancy? I have all kinds of situations running through my head and I just don√¢ Ä ôt know what to think. I might add that I have had 2 ultrasounds b/c I see a specialist due to a previous miscarriage. I believe they are level 2 b/c I didn√¢ Ä ôt have to have a full bladder and could see the fetus clearly on 2 different screens in the room. Everything has been okay with development so far, and I am calculating right on schedule with time of conception and growth of fetus only b/c I know when I conceived. I thought this might help you understand my situation better.

Neither side of our families has it that we know of.    Could it be an anomaly or do you think she has Mafans?    Is there a genetic test to rule it out? or could it be another congenital defect?

I said "short stature"? He is 4 feet tall and he is only 4 years old.    He also weighs 87lbs.    I    have done some reading about it and there might be some similarities which I always thought were behavior issues that we needed to address, till Prader-Willi was told to me.    My son is scheduled to have testing for this done on April 30.    I was hoping maybe you can shed some light on this subject for me and possibly tell me what I need to be asking the person coming to take the blood, and if they have a counselor what kinds of questions should I be asking them.

In turn, my sister and I were both tested.    We are both positive for only one copy of the H63D and our iron count is normal.    So I guess that means we are carriers.    My doctor said there is no need to change my diet and that I don't have to worry other than getting my wife tested so we would know if our offspring is at risk.

post_2697182	476194	Neurofibromatosis	146	462060	Mar 26, 2008	I am a 29 year old woman, and think I might be suffering from Neurofibromatosis, even though this has never been diagnosed, or even hinted at.I first became aware of the condition because I have several cafe-au-lait birth marks - 3 large ones that are about the size of my thumb, and numerous smaller and lighter ones. Thankfully they are around my torso area, and at the tops of my legs, so are easy to cover up. Anyway, I was searching the Internet for possible options to have these marks removed, and came across the topic of Neurofibromatosis. I was horrified to discover, I seem to fit the bill.As well as the birthmarks, my posture has never been fantastic - more so since my teens, to the point where I'm convinced I have bow-legs - another symptom. I also have failing eyesight, although since everyone in my family needs glasses, this might well be a coincidence.I'm not here for any kind of reassurance - I know only a Doctor could confirm if I had the condition or not. I'd just like to know if the occurance of several cafe-au-lait birthmarks (I probably have around 20) is highly possible without some element of the disease?Thankfully I have none of the external lumps as described the sites, although I do have a small lump on my head which I saw the doctor about when it appeared around 13 years ago. He said it was cartilidge, and nothing to worry about, but I can't help but think this another element to the sum!My Mum doesn't have the condition, but since I've never met my Dad, I wouldn't know about him.When I was a baby, I had extensive testing for Hydrocephalus, due to an enlarged head. What is the likelyhood that anything else would have been tested for then?I hate the idea that I might pass this condition onto future children, and they end up with a far worse case than I do.Any advice much appreciated.	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_2726718	27	hlab 27/ crohn's disease	146	468510	Apr 02, 2008	Hello...My brother (40) has a history of iritis and is positive for the hlab27 gene.    When my older daughter was 2 she came down with erythema multiforme.    When she    was 12 she was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease.    My youngest daughter who's 4 now had a case of erythema multiforme last fall.    I recently stumbled across an article linking EM to the hlab27 gene and another one linking Crohn's Disease to hlab27.    What should I do in regards to having my kids tested for the gene?    Is there any way to avoid my younger daughter developing iritis, Crohn's, or any other hlab27 condition if we know she is positive for the gene now?Thank you.	0	Crohn,Crohns,Crohns disease,Crohn's,Crohn's Disease	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2684072	473409	Paternitiy	146	458919	Mar 24, 2008	A woman I was with is pregnant. I had protected sex with her on Januray 4th or 5th. A condom which did not break, slip off, or appear to be damaged in anyway upon inspection (before insertion and after withdrawal). I withdrew immedialty upon if not during ejaculation into the condom. While the sex I had was protected during penetration it is possible that bare penis rubbed against vulva prior to penetration and that pre-ejaculate might have been deposited there. I suppose it's possible that the pre-ejacualate found it's way into her or that somehow sperm leaked out of the base of the condom. What are the chances? I think both those scenarios are unlikely.She had unprotected (withdrawal method with her intoxicated ex-boyfriend) sex on December 31st. Due date is expected to be 9/18/08 (she was 14 weeks pregnant on 3/20 or 3/21), so the baby is either his or mine and given the scenario probably his. While I understand it's possible that the baby is mine, I believe it is unliklely given the scenario described above. We must wait until the baby arrives, ~6 months, to prove paternity for certain. I'm driving myself crazy with worry in the meantime. Don't know how I can last 6 months of this.I simply don't know the probabilites. I would very much appreciate a physician's opinion (hopeful that it will give me peace of mind) on how much I should worry. Is this a 1 in 100, 1 in 5, 1 in 1,000 scenario that it's mine?    Just found all this out and I'm scared (obviously).PS, not that it's relevant because it clearly didn't work, but she was on the pill.	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Vision is "off"...strabismus, wandering eyes, and Im pretty sure he cannot see further than a couple of feet.    Neurologist ruled out a bunch of stuff through some diagnostic tests (MRI and ultrasound of brain) and Ophthalmologist ruled out actual disease of the eye.    We were waiting on some general metabolic and genetic testing and got the results today.The nurse said something about a duplicate something or other and I think she said somewhere on the 4th chromosome.    She said this was a tiny area and no known disease or syndromes are linked to this particular area.    She said it may or may not be related to his difficulties, and they are now wanting to see if my husband or I contributed this particular variation to him.    She said if one of us has it, then they can rule out this variation as the cause of his problems (since we don't have problems) and consider it a normal variant or something like that.    If neither of us has it, then it MIGHT be what is causing his problems, but again not for sure.This seems like a rabbit trail going nowhere...and I was wondering if someone here could help me make sense of this.

Again i concieved in Aug 2006. After 18 weeks we came to know that the baby is Anencephalic. So Doctor advised us for abortion. Again i conceived in June 2007 and before conceiving as per the advise of doctor we have taken 10mg per day folic acid 1 month before conception. and then went for Alfa Feto Protien Level Test from Ranbaxy after 5 weeks of pregancy. Doctors said that the test is within normal level. After 14 weeks we came to know through ultrasound that the baby is again Anencephalic. So again abortion was done. Doctors adviced us for chromosomal studies. The report shows that there is chromosomal defect in my husband i.e there is inversion of 9th pair of chromosome. Now Kindly advice us about following:-1) Should we for second babyor not?2) Is there any treatment for this chromosomal defect i.e inversion of 9th pair?3) My husband is taking a medicine for epilepsy (Epilex 500 and Frisium 5 mg). Is this medicine has any effect on my pregancy i.e abnormality of baby?4) Can we have 100% normal baby?Please advice us and suggest the treatmet.Thanks.	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2622962	460614	PCOS and MS	146	443799	Mar 10, 2008	Greetings Doctor,I am a 28 yr old happily married girl with PCOS. I am very well read on the syndrome and was surprised by a finding that my doctor informed me of.    Never have I heard of MS being connected to PCOS but he had stated that in some cases women with PCOS, who eventually conceive and give birth, have an elevated chance of having a child with MS. Is there truth to this? I have searched all over the web and cannot find any concrete evidence.Since this was brought to my attention I have another concern regarding PCOS and MS. My mother was diagnosed with MS over 20 years ago and exhibited minimal signs of having the disease. In the past 15 years she has had no symptoms as well, without taking any medication. Do you think this connection I have with MS would have anything to do with my PCOS?Truly,KB	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2577432	450985	Genetic Testing	146	432915	Feb 28, 2008	What are the benefits vs. downfall to genetic testing. Three of the six sisters in my family have breast cancer. One just passed away. The other two were both diagnosed with stage I. The clinics do not seem interested in testing you unless you are positive for the cancer. The one sister with cancer wants her ovaries removed-but the surgeon won't remove them without genetic testing. This does not make sense because cancer is cancer. Why let the ugly disease spread? So, the other three of us without cancer get to sit and wait in limbo until we get a positive mamogram(mammogram). Is this right-or should we be seeking other surgeons, or will the outcome be the same. I am not asking for surgery-but I also do not want to die of cancer.

I am 26 years old and 2 years ago I delivered twins a boy and girl at 24 weeks. They survived for only a week and died due to an infection. I am now 18 weeks pregnant with a single child and of course, if you have ever lost a baby it really causes you to worry the second time around. They are taking all the necessary precautions with this pregnancy because I have a weak cervix. So everyday of carrying my child in my womb is such a blessing. At 16 weeks I got the triple quad screen down and all was negative/normal. Yet, today I was informed that the baby had a little spot on its heart that could be a marker for downs. He said it is very common in fetuses. My doc said not to worry being that my results came back fine but with all that I have been through with my previous pregnancy everything worrys me. Can any moms tell me your thoughts on the situation? I am in tears just typing this to you guys. I just been throught so much already. I know that the Lord won't give me more than I can handle. Please advise when ya'll can.

post_2525902	440131	Turner's Syndrome	146	309998	Feb 18, 2008	HiI am particularly interested in the study of human genetics and have got this question: Is there X-inactivation in Turner's Syndrome (X0)? I looked up some sources and they claim there is, and in addition, it is a NON-random inactivation? What does this mean? Does it mean the only X left is being inactivated, thereby causing the girl to have literally no X? And for its inactivation, do the same rules of "escape from X-inactivation apply?" (For e.g, pseudoautosomal regions are left intact)I'll really appreciate it if someone can answer my questions. Thanks so much!	0	turner's	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_2516058	438138	Will Genetic Testing Help?	146	421117	Feb 15, 2008	My mother died of primary mucosal melanoma of the sphenoid sinus last year. Although she had had hundreds of basal cell carcinomas of the head and neck removed during her lifetime, she had no prior history of melanoma. I also have a history, much more mild than she, of basal cell carcinoma incidence. And I have another relative, my mother's brother, who also had over a hundred basal cell CAs during his lifetime and had radically mutating surgery as a result, just as my mother did.    Both lost noses, eyelids, and the external apparatus of their ears.    I am very anxious about the possibility that I may carry a genetic mutation that would predispose me to the same fate, and potentially early death, as my mother suffered. Could genetic testing help identify any genetic predisposition to mucosal melanoma, and, if so, is there anything that could be done prophylactically as a result?    In other words, is there a test?    And would it be worth it?     Thanks very much.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2505965	436240	KTW Syndrome	146	173523	Feb 13, 2008	My daughter was born with KTW.    She was seen in the genetics clinic at the children's hospital.    She has a large hemangioma that covers most of her back, part of her right arm/hand, the right side of her abdoman and some small spots on her left buttock/upper thigh.    My concern is about her foot and left ring finger.    Her left foot is 1 1/2 cm bigger than her right and her second toe is much longer on that foot as well.    Her ring finger on her left hand is bigger than the rest of her fingers.    I am concerned that they will continue to grow at an abnormal rate and that could present problems when she learns to walk.    She is going to be evaluated for OT--when she was born her hands were fisted and the thumb was over the middle finger and held them down and it is difficult for her to extend them.    Any information you can give me would be appreicated.    The Dr. in the genetics clinic is just monitoring her at this point and she will go back in six months.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_2382624	408824	Reason for fat stomach?	146	393130	Jan 19, 2008	I have been married for a little more than 2 years.    I have known my wife for more than 5.    I love her very much.    She has (and I have as well) put on a few pounds in the past 2 years.    We are currently working on it and the results are looking promising.    For the most part we aren't "fat" people.    I am about 6'2 and weigh 180.    No problem there. Just need to put the work in to get the results I want.    My wife is about 5'7-8 and weighs about 138.    She is overall a skinny girl.    Her stomach bothers her the most as it seems her body is predisposed to store fat there.    She is working on it and has done a great job eating well, watching her calorie intake, and working out almost every day.    She has lost about 6 pounds in 2 weeks.Then the bombshell...Turns out my wife has been a lot bigger in the stomach department her whole life... She has been "sucking it in" the whole time I have known her (yes the whole time) and what she says since she turned 14 or so.     It looks like how she describes it as looking 3 months pregnant.    Im proud of my wife for telling me this as she hasnt told anyone before ever.    It took a lot of guts.    Needless to say I was a little shocked.    It really does look like she is 3 months pregnant when she doesnt suck in.    Im a little worried medically about her.    I felt her stomach and it seems a little "hard" to me.    Shouldn't fat be soft for the most part?    I know mine is.Reason for me thinking its genetics is that her parents are a little on the heavy side.    Her father is a overall skinny guy.    Skinny chest, arms, and legs.    But a fat stomach.    Her mother is obese.    My wife is skinny pretty much everywhere else on her body except her stomach which seems overly big.    She says that it first started when she was about 14 or so.    Here was this little blond twig of a girl with a little mound tummy.    She has been ashamed of it forever.     We are trying to have kids soon and she doesn't want to lose too much weight as it might be unhealthy.My question is has anyone ever heard of anything like this?    Im worried as I think she might have something wrong with her hormones or something.    Her brother has a conditon called Congental Adrenal Hypoplasia(spelling).    His body cant produce the right amount of hormones and such.    Does my wife have something similiar?    Seems weird to me that she would look do disproportioned without being something wrong..Sorry for the really long post.

This can happen 4 or 5 nights a week. He is fine during the day but says he is tired all of the time.

post_3252346	591832	Seeking Help for Mom	170	570885	Aug 07, 2008	I am writing to seek help for my mom who has been diagnosed with carotid atherosclerosis and cerebral infarction. She also experiences the symptoms of short-term memory loss (she cannot remember what she had for breakfast, she gets lost in the neighborhood), irritability, confusion, etc., doctors suspect that she may have vascular dementia or AD.My mom was taking Aricept (Eisai), Enteric-coated aspirin, a Chinese medicine that contains Statins, and Ginkgo biloba. But she found purple area on her body (probably Purpura), and the now has stopped taking all drugs except Aricept.My mom develops purpura after taking Aspirin and other drugs, does it mean that she cannot take any anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs, as potentially all of the blood thinners have the risk of causing bleeding? If so, what can she do to reduce blood clotting in the artery to prevent further strokes? She was taking Asprin 100 mg per day, together with Statins, Ginkgo biloba (also an anticoagulant). Could she reduce the dose of aspirin, instead of stopping taking it at all? Or can she take Aspirin but stop taking other anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs (like Ginkgo biloba) at the same time?Thanks! Your kind help will be greatly appreciated!Vickyp.s. My mom does not have high blood pressure, no heart disease, no high blood lipids. Her blood test shows that CHOL, TG, HDL, LDL are within normal range. R80 whole blood viscosity, ESR (20. 0 MM), and RBC (0. 45 L) are beyond normal range.	0	atherosclerosis,infarction,aspirin,vascular dementia,alz,Alzheimers Disease	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_3174737	574405	Not Eating - Body Shutting Down?	170	347178	Jul 19, 2008	Mom was doing fine (except for a little delusional story last week).    But the last week she complained of diarrhea, though with as much as she had eaten (very little) she probably couldn't have had it as long as she said.    Also one day in a.m. she said she had diarrhea, the in p.m. said she was constipated.    At night when my dad and I watch tv she just lays on couch with strange look in her eyes (like she's starring off into space).    The last couple days she's basically refusing to eat - though I can get some her to eat some ice cream.From what I've read on internet it sounds like her body is shutting down-------- "Nerve cell death eventually steals the ability to recognize thirst or hunger.     A dying patient commonly loses interest in eating and drinking, and you should no longer worry about nutrition and hydration.    The person√¢ Ä ôs organ systems are shutting down and can no longer process nutrients."Mom really doesn't have alot of the other symptoms of the "severe stage" - only issues are what I've described above: one delusional story, saying she has diarrhea (can't confirm this), blank stare, a little aggression, and starting to refuse to eat.Is she starting the downward cycle?    Is her body shutting down?	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_3193443	578439	Is it time for assisted living?	170	532802	Jul 23, 2008	My father has vascular dementia.    Up until now he has lived in a senior independent living situation.    Recently, his symptoms have become more severe.    He used to spend alot of time sleeping in his favorite chair.    Now he sometimes doesn't bother to get out of bed.    One day he called me to say he needs to go into a home, that he needs some one to take care of him.    It was very sad. The first time, I looked into it for him and called him back.    He acted like I was crazy and told me he has everything he needs right where he is. He calls me sad like that about once a week.    Where he lives now, nurses come in twice a day to give him his meds. Another nurse comes in once a week to evaluate him.    He is sometimes in heart failure.    He also has post traumatic stress disorder from being in World War II.    She counsels him with that and keeps an eye on his symptoms of dementia. A CNA visits once a week.    She was helping him with socialization.    She would take him for walks, play pool or cards, and have lunch with him. Now he won't cooperate at all.    I think he is depressed.    The geriatric pyschiatrist, who sees him for about 15 min. once a month, thinks that he feels lost and in despair and needs assisted living.    Dad still is able to wash up, dress himself.    He shaves (somewhat) and cleans his dentures.    I heard that moving a dementia patient will only send them down hill more quickly.    I have to admit that when he stares off into space it scares me.    This happens when I ask him things like "would you like juice or coffee?" (I'm learning to say things like "Lets have coffee." to which he only has to answer "ok".) Dad does not know how to use the stove, microwave or coffeemaker any more.    He doesn't have the muscle strength to wander. Although I live a distance away, I visit 3 times/week, make sure he has groceries, take him out to eat, go for a little ride in the car, etc.    He is not a danger to himself or others.    So what would assisted living do for him? I think it might make him feel more lost.    Does anyone have experience with this?    Any comments would be helpful.

She also has a progressing toenail fungus that she will not let me treat. She has an established pattern of excessive daytime sleeping, but not is having extended periods of wakefulness - to the extreme of almost 24 hours at a time. She has asked me what year it is, cannot manage her finances, still insists upon driving short distances, drinks more than a 2 liter of diet pepsi per day...no other liquids, smokes up to 2 packs of cigarettes daily, picks her skin constantly. She is on the normal protocol of meds for Alzheimer's and in addition has CHF and takes meds for that condition as well. My husband and I have moved in to care for her, but it seems she may need an assisted living facility. She has flatly denied the possiblity of ever doing that and we are concerned.

post_3113185	561033	Delusional or Hallucinating	170	347178	Jul 03, 2008	My mom was diagnosed with dementia about 8 months ago.    Something happened yesterday that has scared me.

post_3015367	540226	Seeking help for my grandmother	170	530897	Jun 09, 2008	My grandmother is 79 years old and has always been an incredibly active and outgoing person.    Approximately 12-18 months ago, her personality changed suddenly and dramatically.    She is now withdrawn and quiet.    She has a flat affect and appears to suffer from anxiety and depression.    She is also convinced that she has Alzheimer's; however, tests have confirmed she does not.    She has been on Lexapro and Cymbalta with no noticeable success.    She has an unsteady gait, but her cognitive abilities are still fully intact.    She experienced a TIA several months ago.    The symptoms preceded the incident by 6 to 9 months, so I am not inclined to think the personality changed is definitely associated with the stroke.    My mother thinks she saw a story on Dateline, 20/20 or 60 minutes about elderly individuals experiencing the same problems.    They were able to recover with a specific therapy.    Does anyone have any idea what may be happening to my grandmother and any idea how we may be able to treat it?

post_3022943	541740	Avoiding Exhaustion	170	532802	Jun 10, 2008	Last week it all caught up with me.    I did not even recognize exhaustion until it was full blown. I had been communicationing with my father's primary care physician, cardiologist, dermatologist, getting medications coordinated, talking with the nurses in my father's building who dispense his medication, a visiting nurse (Dad had been in heart failure), a private nurse who checks in on Dad weekly, mostly due to ptsd from WWII and the dementia, and a CNA who visits one afternoon a week to try to get him out of his apartment. Nearly all his mail comes to me, but last week I found a bill in his apartment for a magazine he subscribed to that renews automaticly. I had to take care of that and because his doctor's office will only send correspondence to the patient, I had to send documentation from his insurance company, along with my power of attorney, to get the office to call me with any appointment reminders and pre-op instructions. I was also grieving the loss of the father I used to know.    The one who kept himself maticulously neat and clean.    Most of the time I can accept what's happening to Dad, but last week was really hard. Luckily, my husband and I were able to get away for a few days, but that can't always happen. I need to learn to take care of myself better.    Any suggestions? My father has vascular dementia. He lives in an independent living situation about 30 miles from me.    Last week, when I arrived to take him for a doctor's appointment, I stepped in a puddle on the kitchen floor. Discovering a major leak under the sink, I called maintenance.    While the worker was trying to make temporary repairs, the toilet overflowed. Dad was like a little child.    He didn't know what to do.    My heart went out to him. I explained that the maintenance people would take care of everything.    He was very mellow and accepted that. I don't know what would have happened if I wasn't there. Soon we were on our way to our appointment.    Dad did not know where we were, why or where we were going. He forgot that he has skin cancer on his head.    He will be having Moh's surgery next week.    From what I've been told the cancer was probably made worse because Dad's answer to curing all lesions is to use hydrogen peroxide which from what I understand can kill healthy cells that might combat the cancer.    Both the dermatologist and the surgeon said that the cancer might be very deep.    The surgery involves taking layers of skin and examining them under a microscope while the patient waits.    If there is still cancer present the procedure is repeated over and over until its gone. Microscopic findings can take up to an hour each time. I am trying to think of things to keep Dad occupied during that time. Any suggestions? It just occurred to me that he just might fall asleep inbetween. He sleeps alot. Other that talking about his childhood and the army, I might have difficulty engaging his interest.	2	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

About 3 months ago she threw most of her belongings in the garbage can.    When I realized what she had done (it was too late to retrieve any of the items) she said, after much coaxing, that she had to get rid of things because someone was going to be moving in with us.     About 2 weeks ago she developed such a fear because she says there are voices in her forehead.    She says she has a twin that is trying to get her to do bad things.    She is so afraid and you can see her retreat into herself.    She has eaten nothing all day today because she is afraid her twin is trying to poison her.

post_3118159	561999	hospice	221	553128	Jul 04, 2008	My mom (91) was in an alzheimers facility and last September they said I should consider hospice since she was not eating.    I couldn't do it and she ended up eating again.    Then In December she stopped eating again.    Hospice was once again suggested.    I agreed at that time and 5 days later she passed.    My dad is currently in an assisted living facility.    He is now 92.    He has parkinsons, only 19% renal function (1 kidney), has had some small TIA's (like small strokes) and doesn't want to see anymore doctors.    The facility has suggested Hospice for him.    I did agree, although to me he doesn't appear that bad.    It is my understanding that to qualify for hospice the patient would have less than 6 months to live.    When he was evaluated he did qualify.    I am getting really depressed.    I have not yet mourned my moms passing - lots of chaos in my personal life that I won't go into - but now facing this with my dad I seem to cry at the drop of a pin.    Can anyone shed more light on hospice?    I guess what I am wondering is how accurate are they in the evaluation and life expectancy.	15	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_2876083	512307	erections make diapers impossible	221	451039	May 07, 2008	I am the mother of a very irritable 14-year-old child with spastic Cerebral Palsy. He is also mentally retarded and has the mental capacity of an 18-month-old baby. He is incontinent and must wear adult diapers. It is becoming increasingly impossible to stretch a diaper over him due to the startling size and intensity of his erect penis that extends WELL past his belly button, and it is increasingly difficult to keep my 10 y/o daughter out of the room while I clean him up.    I don√¢ Ä ôt want to hurt him (bend him) so it pokes out under his t-shirt until it subsides, if at all. I hesitate to let my daughter bring her little friends over to the house for obvious reasons. A friend of mine who is also a nurse and caretaker of my son suggested the possibility of giving him special medicine to stop the effects of puberty on his body (penis), completely eliminating any further sexual development as well as curb the natural urges for sex that come with semen production. Because he will always be a baby mentally, she seems to think my pediatrician will prescribe a strong testosterone suppressant that will keep him flaccid and much more comfortable and happy. Are their any long-term health risks related to this kind of body alteration? It sounds so awful√¢ Ä ¶ Is this really a common, legitimate treatment I should look into for my disabled son?	0	erections,erection,diaper,penis,Puberty concerns	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

I have 2 MRI's over the years .. one just recent. Both show I have 4 white spots and haven't changed over the years but want to keep an eye on them. I was wondering if they are caused by brain damage and dementia.Also, they assume I will develope Alzheimer's, as Dad had it at young age. Would an MRI show Alzheimer's. I live in Canada and that is the only best available technology they can do. I am on maximum aricept now and have short term memory loss still and can no longer calculate.Just wondering if they will ever know besides autopsy if and when I have full blown Alzheimers with MRI.	0	white shots,brain damage,brain mri,dementia,trigeminal brain MRI constant	None

I have been diagnosed with GAD, stress disorder, and depersonalization/derealization including mild depression and other smaller problems such as OCD and phobias. I have been on medications for at least 12 years and currently taking effexor and klonopin. I had a severe emotional trauma when I was 12 but I didn't develop PTSD.For the past 4 years my memory has been getting worse, so has my depersonalization and derealization.I have to think hard what I did yesterday or day before. I am also forgetful. I had 2 brain scans in the past and 1 was just a year ago.what scared me the most is when someone mentioned an event that happened a few months ago and I cannot remember it at all. It did happen but I cannot picture it.I live with this brain fog daily and is hard to function but I fear it could be dementia.Any ideas?PS. Klonopin seems to help for stress and anxiety and now I even can work but not being able to recall this event scares the hell out of me.	1	None	None
post_2824268	501786	do you think I have dementia or Alzheimers	1465	490156	Apr 24, 2008	Hi,I hope someone can give me an answer soon. 10/07/08 I had a Cat Scan done because I was concerned about my memory and not being a sharp as I was.It showed mild bifrontal atrophy and everything else appeared normal.    I have severe neck problems so at first I thought it had to do with various medications I am on. Saw a new Dr. for depression and my memory problems came up and he wanted to have a MRI with and w/o contrast which I did. My follow up visit had to be postponed so I got the report.    Most of it was normal, except under findings -noncontrast images reveal a few scattered areas of high signal change in the periventricular deep white matter bilaterally. Under Impression - a few scattered small vessel ischemic change foci demonstrated in the periventricular deep white matter.Does anyone know what this means in laymen terms and does it have anything to do with dementia?    I am so stressed out.    Please can someone help and try and answer this?Thanks so much	0	None	None

post_2999153	536959	Ehlers Danlos questions	146	528083	Jun 05, 2008	I curious about Ehlers Danlos and weight loss. I was diagnosed with EDS when I was born and my mother has it as well. In the last year or so I have lost nearly 50 pounds. I feel great! But I was curious if there were any tips about pulling skin back in naturally. I am not gross and saggy or anything but I have not yet reach my goal and I was curious if it is common to have complications with the skin not pulling back in or and if there are any ideas how to help keep it in. I was also curious about weight and accuracy in meassurement of body fat percentage. As I said before I have been working on losing weight and getting into better shape. I had a body composition done to measure body fat. The results said I was within the "acceptable/healthy" range. But according to my BMI with weight and height, I am obese. I do not look obese but it seems as though I weigh more than one at my size and height might. I was curious if this is heard of or if I should just speak to a genetics doctor here and see what they have to say. I thought I would look into it this way first. Please let me know if there are any commonalities you have heard of or seen before. I am working on setting a goal. I am not sure what kind goal I should set for myself with lack of undertsanding of my measurments and what is actually expected of one with Ehlers Danlos or if this is not related at all.

post_2962323	529627	Genetic test for EDS type III	146	520104	May 27, 2008	Is it true you can't have a genetic test for EDS type III (hypermobility type)?This is what I've been told (or should I say, what I found in my research and read), and it really bugs me because it means I can't get an official diagnosis!My rheumatologist, which I see because of my CFS (NeuroEndocrineImmune Dysfunction Syndrome, more suitable name, really!) also sees fibromaylgia(fibromyalgia)patients all the time and is really putting me in a basket with all CFS/FM patients, so even though he "scanned" me for FM (twice!) and told me I clearly didn't have FM (which I know for sure anyways because working with PWFM and having done a lot of research for a local association, it's very obvious!), he still discredits every thing I tell him about my joints or pains or anything of that type because he simply doesn't listen or look at my file and just categorizes everything I say as "it's normal, it's CFS/FM"...(yeah, I'm looking for another CFS specialists, but they are pretty scarce over here!)So that one is a no-no for EDS diagnosis. Not that I didn't try. (he doesn't even aknowledges my hypermobility, which I have an official diagnosis for!).My physiologist is the one who gave me the hypermobility diagnosis. ...Well in fact he is more stuck on the "ligamenteous hyperlaxity", but doesn't flinch when I use "hypermobility" and sometimes uses it himself. But never on paper. I'm officially "hyperlax".I asked him, sounding simply curious (these creatures are easily scared!) if "I couldn't have EDS type III, you know, the hypermobility one?"... At first he looked like he didn't quite know what I was talking about, then said he didn't know much about it, and finally agreed it was "possible". Wow! But he said something like "but I think theres no way of diagnosing it officially, and what good would it do you to have that diagnosis?" Since I didn't want to push it and it was obvious he didn't want anything to do with that, I simply agreed (and it is true indeed, I won't get any treatment with a diagnosis... simply better recognition and maybe some help, but doctors don't care about that and it's hard to explain... In his mind I already have a name to put on my problem, so why care?).If there could be a test done by a genetician, I would ask for a genetician consultation the next time I see my GP. But if theres nothing to do, I don't think my GP would feel knowledgeable enough on the subject to give me the diagnosis, and if neither a physiatrist nor a rheumatologist are, who would?Thanks	3	EDS type III,EDS,Genetician,Genetics	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3240292	589046	newborn diagnosed with Thalassemia	146	580310	Aug 04, 2008	Hello, I just got a call from my pediatrician stating that my 2 week old baby has alpha thalassemia minor, as indicated by her new born screen. I am confused as to how this is passed on. She is my fourth child and the only one who has been diagnosed with this.Do my husband and I both need to be carriers for her to have this? I am questioning as to whether I could have this myself as I have always been anemic and also have smaller than normal RBC's. If I have this is that enough to have had it passed on to her, or does my husband necessarily have to be a carrier also?Also what does this mean for her when she grows up and decides to have children of her own? Will she be at risk for passing on a more severe form of thalassemia to her children?I have my RN, BSN from Linfield and have been a registered nurse for 6 years now, so I have somewhat of an understanding of the situation, but the genetics are very confusing!Thank you so much for your time, I look forward to your response!	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3228091	586183	Turner Syndrome	146	577543	Aug 01, 2008	I went through the same thing in Feb & March 2008.    I was 18 weeks pregnant had a triple screen test and it came back that I was at high risk of carrying a baby with down syndrome. I went to a specialist to find out what I was having and to also get further testing with the triple screen results. With the ultra sound, they found a large hygroma on the back of the baby's neck, and SHE also had hydrops. I allowed them to do an amnio and it comfirmed Turner Syndrom(syndrome). I was told from that point that I would lose the baby. I was sent home and told that if she stopped moving, to get to my doctor right away, and if she continued to move for the next two weeks, they would have me back to check her heart. With that being said, I was so dissatisfied with the care I was given, I went to another doctor which gave me another untrasound, and showed the hygroma was now even larger and she was filled with fluid.    Her heart showed that she had Hypo plastic left heart syndrome, meaning the left side of her heart was smaller than the right, and I was told she was in conjestive heart failure and her heart would eventually stop.    They were surprised that she hung on for as long as she did, but I carried her till I was 22 weeks, then I had to be induced and gave birth.    She weighed 2lbs and was 11 inches long.    Almost 1/2 of her weight was fluid, and it was a very hard to have to see her in such a condition.    But we were able to spend time with her, have a proper burial and so forth, which helped some.    I'ts    still to understand why something like this had to happen.    I have a four year old daughter that I had in previous relationship, which she is fine, and I never saw this coming.    I'm not sure if the worry will ever go away, but you need to try and focus on the positives in your life and go from there day by day.    I'm now trying to get pregnant again, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm so scared something like this will happen again.    But I try and remember that god won't give you more than you can handle.    I don't know if this is true, but I sure do try to believe it.    God bless you, and I will pray for all of you out there that have been through the same thing.This discussion is related toturner syndrome.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

The results said negative risk for downs syndrome and had 1 in 3000 risk,    but then after it said that based on maternal age alone the risk was 1 in 130. This really confused me. I am 37 years old.My husband and I are concerned about chromosone abnormalities and not sure if we should have an amnio or not.    We are deciding whether to wait and have the 2nd trimester screening and see what those reults come up with or just have an amnio now instead of later, I was told that it was better to have the amnio around 16 weeks and this is next week. Do the results above sound like a high risk or low risk of downs syndrome. Any thoughts or previous experience would be greatly appreciated!!Thanks so much!!!	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3195230	578852	Can you have two unsuccessful pregnancies and go on to have a healthy baby?	146	569310	Jul 24, 2008	My husband and I have been trying for two years to have a baby, in which we have gotten pregnant twice. Unfortunately, neither pregnancy made it. The first pregnancy which was with a little boy we named Zane, at 19 weeks, we found out that he had a sever brain disease known as semi-lobar holoprosensephly. This means that he was born without the front part of his brain. Our doctors said that more than likely he would die within the first 30 hours of his life and that if he got the slim chance to live, he would be a vegetable for the rest of his life, completely reliant on tubes with no emotion or sense of anything. He was blind and deaf as well. We were advised to abort the pregnancy due to everything that was wrong not to mention the complications that it would cause with me. With the second pregnancy,    at 18 weeks, we went to our specialist to make sure that what happened last time, didn't happen again. We discovered that it had not, but that something else had went wrong, the baby had no heartbeat. We had went to my regular doctor's on July 2nd and everything was fine. By July 9th when we went to the specialist, he had died. We named him Sylar. When I delivered him, his cord was wrapped around his body and neck. Currently, this is the known cause of death but because of what happened previously and then this, my husband and I are going through all kinds of genetic testing. No results have been given yet. I was curious if this had happened to anyone else, mainly the holoprosenphly. There is not much information on this particular disease that I have been able to find.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I live in Irvine, Orange County, CA and would be 35+ at the time of delivery. My first trimester testing came normal and I am considering doing Amnio knowing that first trimester testing is a screening type test. Since amnio has a potential risk of miscarriage which often can be eliminated when the procedure is performed by an experience doctor. Often recommended to find a doctor who does at least 50 procedures per year.I went through a genetic counseling session and the counselor recommended three doctors at St Joseph's Hospital in Orange County with whom the counseling group is attached to. I have no clue on these doctors' expertize and the counselor is not able to provide any statistics on the doctors' expertize or how many amnio procedures do they do. I am desperatively looking for a highly skilled doctor in Orange County or Los Angeles County to perform Amnio procedure for me.Anybody knows about a doctor who does more than 100 Amnio procedures in a year or is know for his/her expertize on Amnio test by his/her peers. Please e-mail me their contact info at my profile name at yahoo.Thanks and looking forward to your help in this matter	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3122538	562994	Numbness in hands and feet.	146	554166	Jul 06, 2008	Hello √¢ Ä ì I√¢ Ä ôd appreciate any help or advise regarding my problem. I√¢ Ä ôll try to keep this as brief as possible. I am a male in my early forties. I have a pretty rare form of Brachdactylia and as a result my hands and feet have been affected by a form of Dwarfism. To put that in perspective my feet measure 10√¢ Ä ù from heel to toe and my hands are 6 √Ç Ω√¢ Ä ù from base of palm to tip of finger. My index finger measures just under 3√¢ Ä ù in length and my big toe measures 1 √Ç Ω√¢ Ä ù The rest of me is pretty average - I am 5√¢ Ä ô10√¢ Ä ô√¢ Ä ô with an average build and no other signs of dwarfism or shortness of bones. I've never discussed this with a doctor.Until recently the only problems associated with this condition have been a small amount of social stigma if someone notices and decides to make a remark. This doesn√¢ Ä ôt happen that often and I√¢ Ä ôve pretty much been able to deal with it in a positive way. I am conscious of it and do try and hide it as much as possible, hands in pockets or clenched fists, that type of thing. I know it√¢ Ä ôs a genetic problem and just one of those things, in fact the only real issue I√¢ Ä ôve found is that I can√¢ Ä ôt get a pair of gloves to fit that well, ladies gloves fit the fingers a little better but aren√¢ Ä ôt quite wide enough.Recently though, I have been getting severe pain in my hands and feet and I can only liken it to a muscle cramp or a very painful tingling feeling. Usually the pain comes when I awake but also happens at fairly regular intervals throughout the day and the symptoms last for about 15 minutes. I√¢ Ä ôm a little bit worried that these symptoms have something to do with the Brachydactylia. I know that the best thing to do is to go and see a doctor but I thought I would post on here first to see if anyone else has heard of anything similar.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I the summertime it also spreads up my arms and around the sides of my back (up high, under the shoulders. At its worst, I had it covering my entire back, torso, stomach and half of my face.

post_2962267	529611	limited carpal fusion (partial wrist fusion) w/ EDS III?	146	520104	May 27, 2008	Hi, I'm new to this forum and hope I can get some insight on this...I've got Ehlers-Danlos type II (hypermobility type), and for the record, I've also got CFS, or as it should be called : NeuroEndocrineImmune Dysfunction Syndrome or NDS.My most recent injuries are 3 partially torn ligaments (plus cartilage tear) in my right (dominant) wrist.All injuries are pretty old, but when you have hypermobility, it takes a lot to have something investigated, and when they finally decide to do so, it takes forever here in Quebec (more than a year since the consultation where the doc decided I should have the exam to the consultation where I got the results)So the first tear happened well over 4 years ago (didn't even notice how, just kept re-injuring it every 2 weeks or so!), and a year and a half ago I sprained the wrist good, and that's when I torn the 2 other ligaments and the cartilage. Doesn't take much anymore : it crackes when I made a "rough" move to put on my vest! Of course, it was one of the rare times when I didn't have my cast on (for the previous tear).So I finally got exams and conclusive results (which is rare in our cases, huh? In fact, I only agreed to do the exams if the doc agreed to seriously look it through even if a tear had partially started to heal).Of course, because of the underlying situation, individual repairs of all 3 ligaments would be pretty much useless, the doc said, and he'd be surprised if we could find any surgeon willing to do it.Even though I agree, I was pretty frustrated, because why then did he want to do the exams? He could pretty much guess what we would find (except we thought there would be max. 2 tears, not 3 PLUS cartilage!!!).So I made him understand my deception, and that doing nothing meant I'd have to spend the rest of my life with the cast on my wrist! (I re-injure too easily and it hurts too much).So he stopped, thought, and asked how much I needed the cast in my everyday life. After I drew him a pretty ugly picture, he agreed to ask for a surgeon's opinion on repairing the torn ligaments... but not before he talked to me about another option!Pretty dramatic, but much more interesting to me than he would've ever thought : LIMITED CARPAL FUSION, or partial wrist fusion (there are at leas 2-3 other names out there!). : Instead of the big bar that fuses the hand with the forearm with all the bones in between like in the "total" fusion, it's only some of the numerous bones that compose the hand and wrist. Of course how many and which ones will have to be decided by the surgeon (with me, of course), but I guess it would be between 3 and 8.The biggest advantage would be no more sprains. Maybe even less pain, but I'm not even hoping for that. The pain isn't really related to bone movement anyways, like in arthritis.Repairing the torn ligaments is of no use because not only could I tear them again in a year, but I could tear the ligament just next to one of them just as soon. There are so many ligaments in there that there are endless possibility to an EDS III body... ;o)I do understand a surgeon not really wanting to "waste" his time and energy on a job not really "worth it". Plus, I personnaly could waste healing time and a lot of pain for nothing too... Just trying to imagine how I'd feel spraining my wrist in 2 years if I'd go for the repair option... :-OWith the fusion, I could no longer sprain the wrist ligaments, so we would know for sure it wouldn't be for nothing...The big NO argument of course is the loss of mobility. Well I especially understand how it's so huge in the mind of a doctor, for whom health and the best working body is a must, and also coming from someone in good health!But for me, having used a cast completely limiting my wrist movements for more than 2 years now, I honestly have trouble seeing the problem with limited movements... Especially since I'm guessing the limited fusion would give me more mobility than the cast!I've been hoping for the past year that I'd get a surgery, thinking the whole time : the worst that could happen, if it doesn't work, is I'll be stuck in a cast... hum, let's see... I'm already in a cast! ;o)(of course I'm not stupid, I know it could be worst if it doesn't work... there are complications possible. I meant simply not giving the results hoped for).But of course I'd like to hear from others with a similar situation or experience... Am I thinking this right? How bad is the limitation in mobility with a limited fusion surgery?Do they take bone graft with this one as they do with the total fusion?Is it usually under total aenesthetic procedure, or just local?How long did it take you to heal? Because of CFS I can't work anyways, so I'm not worried about going back to work, but simply everyday life, as much of that as I have anyways...Could I have trouble writing after that surgery? (I mean, not immediatly after, but once it's healed)So, thanks a bunch everyone!(sorry for the long post!

post_3696798	695114	Maraijuana a new treatment??	170	689859	Nov 24, 2008	My dad suffers from AD.    He is 65 years old....diagnosed at 62 and is already considered early stage 2 of the disease.    My mom and myself are his primary caregivers (she lives at home w/ him I live in the same town, but with my son and husband..)    The AD came early, and, came quick.    I have watched my dad go from being my loving, sweet, intelligent dad.....to a nervous, obsessive, sometimes grouchy shell of himself.    I have seen cancer take people in what I thought to be the most viscious of ways...until now.    AD is by far one of the most devastating diseases I've ever come in contact with.    Utterly heartbreaking....I feel for each and every one of you who live with this disease...as patients or caretakers.I am always looking for new medicines to treat AD....looking for what's on the horizon. Several months ago I came upon a small article that talked about THC (the active component in Marijuana) being studied to inhibit plaque growth on the brain.    I've been constantly checking on these studies to see what has progressed and what I read is promising....http://www.babyboomer-magazine.com/news/123/ARTICLE/1131/2008-01-31.htmlWhat do you all think?    I think it's ironic...treating a disease that epitomizes forgetfulness with a drug that for years has been said to cause it??	26	treatment,brain,THC,Altzheimer's Disease,plaque on the brain	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

My question is whether having altzheimers causes the person to return to extremely negative bahavior (extreme irrational anger, bitterness, stubborness and just plain hatefullness) towards adult children where there had been a reconciliation for 6 years?    She also seems to lack care about the progress of her husband (who is 87) who is in a convelscent center with a broken hip.

post_3385911	18	Short term memory lapse in 18 year old	170	615403	Sep 09, 2008	Im 18 years old and have recently been having a strange sensation. It's difficult to describe, but Im going to give it try. The first symptom is frequently becoming suddenly aware of my surroundings. The only thing I can compare this to is standing up too quickly and "browning out". The sensation you get the instant you return from the blackout is what I'm experiencing. If i think about it, Im able to recall all of the details of how i got where I am. However, the strange part is that it doesn't feel like it was part of the same moment, but instead like I'm trying to recall yesterdays events. Its like a brief lapse in my short term memory. Having to consciously try to remember the previous events and there significance in my life is very unsettling.The second symptom is that live events don't fully register with my brain. Life feels much more like a movie than reality, and I have almost zero sense of self. I will be in a place and every so often it will occur to me that the event is actually taking place. I should state however that Im in no way depressed, just that nothing quite feels real. Physical exercise seems to temporarily stop all of the above symptoms, and Im active as often as possible.I know Im not giving you much to work with, but any advice would be helpful. Im basically asking if you think something is wrong, or if Im just becoming an adult.Much Thanks	7	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_3594398	671240	Does pain sensations go away	170	626058	Oct 30, 2008	My 78-yr-old mom has alzheimers and she has worn these special rings on her thumbs for arthritis for many years.    She says she can't hold anything without them.    She takes them off each night and puts them on in morning.    She was helping me clean the other day and put them in a place other than where she normally puts them, so she's forgotten to put them back on (this was a few days ago).    I noticed last night she hasn't been wearing them and she's picking up glasses to drink from, putting dishes away, etc. all things she's previously said she can't do without the rings.    I can't figure out what's going on with her now - now that she can do everything without the rings.    Is her brain now NOT telling her she has pain?

post_3529142	655969	Does this sound like an Alzheimer's symptom?	170	244247	Oct 14, 2008	My mother is 65. She is terrified of getting AD, because her own mother has it. She has been having very mild memory troubles that may or may not be early symptoms of AD for a couple of years. But the other day, something very different happened to her. She was visiting my brother, and they were talking about her house, when suddenly she couldn't picture her house or anything about it. This lasted almost a minute.She is convinced that this episode means that she does indeed have Alzheimer's. She's going to see a neurologist. But I'm not so sure. From what I've read, it doesn't sound like something that happens to a patient in the very early stages of AD. Sounds more like a TIA or something. Does anyone know?

No one in Mom's family had these type of symptoms at a young age. In fact, most lived into their 80's and 90's and were still living alone.    Because of that I wasn't convinced she had Alzheimers.    A relative told me about Picks.    He said it was caused by stress or abuse.    My mother was verbally and emotionally abused by my father their entire marriage. I could understand closing her mind to get away from him.I guess my questions are...Is this a true statement regarding Picks?Are Alzheimers or Picks inheirited?    (Sorry, I know that's spelled wrong)I'm getting close to the age my mother was when she first started exhibiting symptoms and am scared to death.    Every time I misplace my keys or forget someones name I panic, thinking that I'm getting one disease or the other.Can anyone help?

post_3301502	22	Im 22 and I have memory loss	170	594849	Aug 19, 2008	Hi, Im 22 years old and I am having short term memory loss. Ive read up on it, and for the record, im not on drugs, no std's, no trauma to the head, and ive never been pregnant. I forget entire conversations ive had, i forget im cooking, i completley forget a lot of movies ive seen, i could watch them again, and feel for the most part that ive never seen it. I forget small things like when im supposed to be somewhere or where i put something, even if i tell myself, "remember to do this", or "remember where you put that", like a hiding spot or something. Its weird.. and part of me thinks my life is busy.. its normal to forget things, but than when I have my mom and my friends, asking me with a serious face if i remember this or that and than telling me that there might be something wrong, than I second guess the situation. So, am I normal, or could this be something to get checked out? Also, what might this be from, if anything. Any information would be greatly appreciated....thank you!	1	im 22 and i have memory loss!	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_3363905	617704	What policies for hired caregivers?	221	389974	Sep 04, 2008	Swampy is thinking about writing up a set of policies for caregivers. New caregivers will have to sign a copy, but current caregivers will be grandfathered in.So far, Swampy has thought of the following (and will obviously order these things and group them by subject):1. Caregiver schedule is controlled by Swampy's mom. Approve any schedule change with her.2. The caregiver is not to invite anyone to the house, unless there is a specific work related reason. Swampy's mother, naturally, can always invite someone in as a guest.3. In case of hospitalization, the caregiver must immediately notify both the health care proxy and Swampy.4. The caregiver is expected to sit with Swampy's mom at the table while she eats (and, if possible, eat with her as well).5. No caregiver is to leave dirty dishes past end of shift.6. The dishwasher will be completely emptied of clean dishes when it is first open, an open dishwasher will always contain dirty dishes.7. The caregiver is to sign in and out at start and end of shift, and to keep the logbook as required. The caregiver is to remain in the house with Swampy's mom until the next shift arrives.8. Caregivers are to maintain a polite decorum. Remember that Swampy's mom was raised in a era when formalisms such as "please" and "thank you" were a requirement.9. Swampy's mom gets to decide when she wakes up, goes to bed, uses the toilet, and eats. Caregivers must do this immediately when asked.10. Caregivers will maintain constant, predictable work hours. An occasional special circumstance may require changing shifts, however, it cannot happen often.11. Caregivers will hold information they learn through their employment confidential.12. Caregivers are not to burden Swampy's mom with their personal situations. Caregivers are to limit personal calls at work to what is minimally necessary.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_3715489	699612	Gender?	146	697343	Nov 29, 2008	Ok here's how it goes. I would consider myself a person with gender identity disorder.    But in researching that I have come to numerous questions about my birth.My parents, as far as I can remember have never talked to me about my birth. There are some pieces to the puzzle here that I call to question, my name was never put on my birth certificate,    and (until I had to get my permit for driving), I heard my sister talking to my mother about my birth awhile ago and she said that "the doctor didn't know what I was at first"....I also have always, like the typical people with gender identity disorder always felt more like a boy....since forever.Is it possible that I had some early genital ambiguity and that it was fixed and I wasn't told about it?What makes me question that is that I have never (to my knowledge) received hormone treatment, and I have a normal period in as far as it comes relatively monthly, its hard to say if it skips months because its not all that consistent in that I can't judge when it comes(not that I've really payed a lot of attention to it, with my disorder I prefer to think of it as little as possible).    And it is usually extremely painful, I'm not talking about normal cramps these things leave me writhing and I become nauseous, and sometimes my hands and legs become numb, and no its not because I hyperventilate from the pain, that's what the school nurse thought when I was in high school. I am not sexually active either. And I have gone in about that but I did some blood tests and there was really no conclusion other than take ibuprofen, which I take a lot of and that usually stops them, if I take them in time..is it reasonable to question this? Or am I just searching for other reasons why I think the way I do	3	gender,hormone,treatment,genital,other	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3716395	2	Episodic Ataxia type 2/Familial Hemiplegic Migraine	146	302054	Nov 30, 2008	Hi,I hope this post finds you well.    I have a question for you - since it's complicated - I will give you some back history in order to be able to ask the question and it make sense....My daughter has been a 'medical mystery' for almost 2 years now (she's 3 now).    She has been having many episodes of shaking (but not seizures), unresponsiveness (but breathing normally - just no response even to painful stimuli), fatigue, left side of her face droops/flattens at the nasolabial fold intermittently, right eye has Ptosis, at times her speech is hard to understand, articulation is poor.    She has episodes of left sided weakness.    She has moments where her hands and feet will open wide and she'll posture a bit.    She has feeding difficulty (thin liquids cause her to aspirate requiring thick-it for thin liquids).    She's had one seizure that we are aware of.    She has headaches and tires extremely easily.    On her 'bad' days she falls a lot and is not only irritable, but she usually usually has the droop on the left and the Ptosis on the right occur simultaneously as well as extreme fatigue.    She has had metabolic abnormalities - but nothing that 'screams' anything in particular.Genetic workup has currently revealed (through the work of an amazingly perceptive doctor!)Carrier for Tangier DiseaseMutation at 10398 A>G for the Mitochondrial Genome AnalysisMutation at exon 1 position 37 (Arginine is replaced with Glutamine) for the Episodic Ataxia type 2/FHM 1 gene.    The mutation has never been seen before - but given it's position, the fact that it's replaced with a polar amino acid (glutamine) and the fact that it's been highly conserved across all evolution (the arginine) - and that she was tested for this because she fit most of the symptoms perfectly - they feel this is disease causing.She also has hypogammaglobulinemia and receives weekly infusions of gamma globulin sub-q which has drastically improved her health and quality of life (from that aspect).Family history is strong with many on mothers side of the family having severe migraines, neurological, autoimmune issues, blood sugar issues (diabetes in many and just hypoglycemia in others), autonomic nervous system dysfunction.    Brother has Chiari Type 1, basilar migraines, ketotic hypoglycemia, hypogammaglobulinemia (infusions as well), was dx with Autism at 2 but dx has recently been changed to ADHD with OCD tendencies, heat intolerance.    Brother is not a Tangier carrier.Results are still pending for mother's EA2/FHM - but she is a confirmed carrier of Tangier Disease and also has mutation 10398 A>G in the Mitochondrial Genome Analysis.    The genetics doctor believes there's a very good chance mother has the EA2/FHM mutation given her symptoms being consistent with it.At one point there was talk of having muscle biopsy done - but since the EA2/FHM finding, that has been dropped.    Acetazolamide treatment is in the start of 2nd week.My question is this - the mutation at 10398 A>G has no pathogenic undertones in the general population - symptomatology with this mutation is all over the place....but I have heard 2 doctors pose that, alone this mutation might not mean anything - but given all of our genetic mutations and the nature of EA2/FHM - that the mutations could affect the body enough to cause, at the very least Mitochondrial dysfunction.We are seeing a doctor on Monday to ask about EA2/FHM - from what I've read - this disease CAN cause fatigue, but not to the degree she has - so I wonder if the Mitochondria could be affected in some way and exacerbating things?     What are your thoughts?Thank you for your time!	0	ataxia,episodic,familial hemiplegic  migraine	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I did have the nueclo- transluency test at 12 weeks in which no markers were indicated and my statistics were 1 in 10,000.When the technician first did all the measurements, she said everything looked great.    The Dr., however, questioned her marking of a nasal bone and said it was skin.    I am caucasian, 35, and have a healthy 2 year old boy.    My husband's sister has an 11 year girl with downs.

It was due around the 10.-14. of November 2008 (In October it came on the 15.). On Friday November 14/08 I needed to have X-rays of my pelvic,lumbar region because I'd been experiencing severe back pain that week and wanted to find out what was wrong.    The x-ray technician asked me prior to the x-rays if when the last time was that I'd had my period and realized it was so close to when it was due again. I told her that I didn't have my period right before my x-rays.So she went ahead and did them. I still haven't had my period and it's Thursday November 20. it's a week over do and there's no chance of my being pregnant. Should I see my doctor? What could be wrong with me?

post_3666453	687887	antibody risk in pregnancy	146	684905	Nov 16, 2008	Hello,I was warned that there is a risk of complications if I get pregnant again and am trying to figure out exactly what those risks are to me and the baby before I schedule a tubal ligation. My first pregnancy was totally normal. (My husband and I are o+ blood types) My second pregnancy showed an -e antibody. Regular blood work was done and the numbers never rose above 1:1. My sons biliruben levels jumped very fast after he was born and he was under bili-lights for five days.I was told the antibody issue becomes a larger problem with each pregnancy and there is a good chance I may have a miscarriage if pregnant. If I did make it to 9 months, there may be more severe complications with the baby. He suggested we not have any more children. This is fine, but I am a person who needs more details before making my decision. I do not need anything sugar coated but want to educate myself as much as possible. What is the worst case scenario? My OB suggested I see a perinatologist, but the nearest one is over 3 hours away.Thank you for your time,	0	antibody,Pregnancy,problem	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3662818	687032	Noonan's Syndrome	146	683916	Nov 15, 2008	I have a question regarding Noonan's Syndrome if anyone has any expertise.    I have 3 children that have had various health problems.    Doctors have told us there is no connection.One son was born with Tetralogy of Fallot.    He was also born with a two vessal cord, subglottic stenosis, and anal stenosis.    This child has some issues at school.    Many teachers state that he has ADHD and have suggested we look into medication, but I have not been comfortable with this.    I have also noticed that his lips and eyebrows do not look like the other childrens.    Also, my son is almost 10 yrs old and only weighs 50 lbs.    He is short, but not to an extent that red flags have went up.    Recently, he has had what appears to be blood in his urine, but when tested no blood was present.    Although, the test revealed his urine was high in protein. He has an upcoming appointment and I am going to request that his urine be tested for myoglobin. The only other issues that this child has is that he is prone to cavities and he had feeding problems at birth due to a high palate and oral-motor skills.Another son has been diagnosed with ideopathic short stature and is receiving growth hormone treatment.    He also had an episode where his shoulder seemed to dislocate on its own.    When the doctors tried to relocate it, they decided that his shoulder just sits very loose in its socket and was not actually dislocated.    This son has pretty severe mood problems.Another son has pectus excavatum and is able to dislocate on shoulder.    The shoulder area will stretch to the extent that the tissues resemble when someone is stretching taffy.    He was also born with bilateral vesicoureteral reflux and has asthma.Another son has no health issues that we have seen.    He is the youngest.I know not all, but many, of these things are associated with Noonan's syndrome.    I am wondering if Noonan's can be present but be so mild that only one or two characteristics can be exhibited in each child.    It seems that if one child presented with all of the symptoms that I listed that Noonan's would probably be considered.Does anyone have enough expertise to offer advise or let me know if this is something I should pursue?	0	Noonan's	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Initially i was informed by doctors that I had a slipped disc due to which pains were transmitting in back, legs, arms, shoulders etc. Later last year I came to know that I am hla b27 positive. My rheaumatologist started giving me steroids n pain killers which I was alreday using twice or thrice a day for last 3-4 yrs.

I am 5' - 3'' tall n weigh around 75 kgs. Now Dr. says I shud take a treatment called Remicad (am not sure how do we spell it). But he said that relief from pain is not guranteed even after this treatment. It will cost me much.. pls suggest shud i go for this treatment or not.

post_3486328	645913	Integrated screen	146	639815	Oct 03, 2008	I'm 44 and pregnant. My doctor can not seem to explain to me what a positive result on the Integrated screen would mean for me. My age alone puts me in a high risk category for Down's Sydrome- I understand that. Will the Integrated screen automatically yield a high risk result for me because of my age alone? I'm also confused that she says that the highest risk the tests can yield is 1 in 100. This, to me, means a 1% chance of having a baby with one of the birth defects the screen is measuring. However, I keep reading-- and my doctor agrees-- the screen (without amniocentesis) has a 92% accuracy rate in predicting Downs Syndrome (or Trisomy 18 or a neaural tube defect). This is conflicting data to me. If I got a positive on the integrated screen, could I interpret that to mean there is a 92% chance my baby has one of the 3 birth defects? If so, why are the results reported in a ratio such as 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 250, etc.? If it's going to come out positive simply because I'm 44, it's just another worry for me to have with no value.

It has also been verified that I have MVP and tachycardia.    I have noticed whenever I drink red wine, I will have shortness of breath, foot and calf spasms and sometimes heart palpitations.    Is this due to the MVP and if so, is it recommended to not drink any wine here after?    Is this a common occurance?    I have noticed it in the past, but now that I have an actual diagnosis of my genetic circumstances, Im wondering if it could be related.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3579082	667708	Breast Disease and Other Madness	146	663183	Oct 26, 2008	I am currently 40.    I worked full-time and went to school full-time for 10 years.    I have my BA, MS and JD.     I want to be better!!     When I was 20, I had grapefruit sized cysts that wrapped around my tube and ovaries and had to undergo a major surgery to correct this.     Then when I was 26, I started getting a lot of pain in my arms and limbs and was dxed with polyarthalgia.     I have DJD since 29 in my spinal and neck along with a couple of herniations..    In 2001, when I was 32, I went through my first breast cancer scare in my left breast - there were numerous diagnoses for this including, atypia with hyperplasia, papillomas, fibroadeomas, the list goes on and on and had a lumpectomy.        Now in 2008, I have a tumor in my right breast.    I underwent a biopsy last week and am awaiting the results.    I also get cysts on both the left and right of my head behind the ears at least I think that is what they are!.     Is there some kind of recommended genetic testing that you recommend?        I also have a congential hemangioma in my thoracic spine (it does not bother me, but wonder if this is relevant).     Many of my relatives have died of cancer - breast, adrenal, lung, metastatic, GI, stomach, many of them young as well.        I am not sure what to do here, but I simply want to get better.        Sorry to be so long, but any help would be most welcome.

I got pregnant in January and 13 weeks later miscarried at home.    I didnt get the rhogram shot.    In July I got l pregnant again, and 12 weeks later, miscarried again.    I didn't get the rhogram shot again.    This totally slipped my mind.    My mother brought it to my attention today and now I am totally freaked out.    I guess my questions are:    Can I still get the shot 9 weeks after the miscarriage? I still have breast milk?    is that making me miscarriage? Is it in my best interest to get the shot?    If I get pregnant again, is it true I will miscarry or have a still birth full term?    9-1-08 I had the worst period ever.    I was an emotional wreck.    I sleept 16+ hours a day.

post_3545520	659862	Rh negative	146	654850	Oct 18, 2008	My mother is 64 years old.    Her mother was Rh negative.    My aunt, the fir born had no problems during birht. My mother, the second born did, but continued to live. She was born in the 1940's, prior to any treatment such as Rhogam was available.She has always had heart murmur problems & anemia.    Since 1994, she has had blood clots and 3 different pulmonary embolisms.    She has been on Coumadin therapy now for the last 14 years.    Whenever, she needs to have a surgical type of procedure, the doctors must stop the Coumadin for 5 days.    After the procedure, she develops blood clots and another pulmonary embolism arises. She has now developed kidney disease and a complex renal cyst.In your opinion, could this be connected to the Rh factor? If so, are ther any treatments at this time in her life that she can take to prevent any further complications?Thank you for any information that you can provide.Shannon	1	Pregnancy,rh factor	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

My doctor just called me over the phone to inform me of this condition my baby has plus dilated kidneys. I am wondering if the deep sonogram that the specialist will perform in my next appointment will be a 100% accurate to rule out birth defects, and if he does, what are other complications I should expect for the baby to have? WIll there be a chance that my baby can die before I give birth? during birth?, or after? Will she be born early? Will I be able to still have a vaginal birth? And if I decide to do an abortion incase there are severe birth defects, does that affect me trying to get pregnant again since it would be such a late term abortion?

The full extent of the anomalies may only be known by 25-26 weeks on a scan or at birth.Since the scope of the anomalies is not predictable at this stage and since the seriousness of the anomalies which we have currently detected is severe, reduction is the prudent option.

post_3485444	645693	Family History and Cancer genes	146	625148	Oct 03, 2008	Ive written before about my health and how I am really concerned. My family always laughs at me saying Im being a hypochondriac but I know my body and I know its not well. What my concern is that my family has a history of Cancer and cysts. My mother whom I just met only a few years ago told me recently that her maternal grandmother had Breast cancer which resulted in a double mysectomy at the age of 50. My mother had a removal of a benign breast tumor, multipul ovarian cysts, removal of right ovary due to ovarian varicocele (which by the way, was not found until time of surgery to remove a large cyst ), and Endometrial cells now present for 5 mos. with cramping and pelvic pain. D&C, hystoscopy and X-lap scheduled. She also has MS if im not mistaken and liver cancer. Now I have been having some similar problems. Im very cystic and recently have a mass size of 5 maybe 6cm. Ive come very close to having Cervical cancer from Dysplasia thankfully it was cought and had a LEEP. Im in pain most of the time, sex hurts, i tend to bleed after, my ovary area feels like a stress ball being sqeezed, Im bloated all the time, i have a pressure on my bum when i sit, my cycle is wacky, hurts to walk or sit. Now I am really sore on the side of mt right breast. All these things have recently come up. Ive never had these types of symptoms before other than the ovarian cyst pain. Ive called my PCM and had several appointments with "them" and have told them my concerns. Now I know that just because my mom has all these things and my grandmother had cancer too that I am not nessesarily next in line. I justam out of ideas how to express my concern and get some real action from them. I even called to ask for a CA125 test done and i was almost laughed at and was told "no, we dont do that. Until its a concern. You will have to go see an off base doc and pay out of pocket.

post_3444280	636169	How do I know if my son has Ehlers Danlos?	146	628485	Sep 23, 2008	My 5 year old son, Zachary,    was born with rather severe swan neck deformities in his index and middle fingers on both hands.    We took him to a hand doctor and were told he might have EDS.    Zachary's elbows hyperextend more than 20 degrees.    His lower extremities do not appear to have abnormal flexibility.    He has developed at a normal rate and is very active.    He plays soccer and appears average or slightly above average in his agility and coordination.    He has never had a dislocation.    He does not bruise easily and heals quickly, however, he had stitches in his upper lip last year and they simply fell out, which I read was common in people with EDS.    He also has weak intrinsic hand muscles and is unable to suspend his body weight on the monkey bars, which the other kids in his class seem to do easily.    I took him to a hand therapist and he wears splints on his fingers.    She said his hands were weak and gave him thera putty to squeeze every day.    She thought it was likely that Zachary has EDS but could not make a referral.    Our pediatrician doesn't seem to know much about it and I don't know where to go (we live in Ohio).    I don't know if I should wait to see if he develops more symptoms or aggressively seek to diagnose or rule out this disorder so I can modify his activities and begin exercises that would promote joint stability??    If he does not have EDS why would he have the swan neck deformitities?

Allergy testing all negative as well as all other diagnostic testing for chronic coughing. Multiple doctors and many medicines, antibiotics, steriods, ct scans, sinus operations, acid reflux treatments, heart tests- echo etc. Condition continually getting worse. Received recent diagnosis of aggrivated asthma which is job related working within the construction industry for close to 40 years. Shortness of breath upon exertion is becoming a major concern. Elevated pressure in right chamber of heart, that my second heart doctor believes in not related to a heart condition. The pressure is not great enough to treat at this time. All testing was negative for everything except Asthma. However, I was found to be a carrier of CF gene, heterozygous1717 1 G-A and polymorphism M470V.    Negative sweat test.Was told that I did not have CF. Resent diagnosis is job related aggrivated asthma. Could there be a correlation between being a CF carrier and a chronic lung, coughing, sputum production, sinus problems, acid reflux etc, conditions that never improve despite all intervention. Or at the very least,    could it be that being a carrier of the CF leads to a greater susceptibility for work relates deseases. Thank you.This discussion is related toCF.	1	cf	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3367186	618437	cardiac rhabdomyoma or EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus?	146	610860	Sep 05, 2008	In an 18 week ultrasound our technican found our baby has SUA in the umbilical cord.    On our 24 week ultrasound, they identified a very small 1-5mm mass in the apex of the left ventricle (very safe place to be) saying it could be a cardiac rhabdomyoma, fibroma or a EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus.    They had to look 3x over because of it hiding so well and so small.    I am stressed to the gills with this....Because we lost a child in our previous pregnancy (she had 2 cardiac masses in her left ventricle which were on the actual left ventricle wall and septum), they can't ignore the history and are speculating that this may be the initial signs again of cardiac rhabdomyomas leading to Tuber Sclerosis but they have confirmed they cannot factually say this with the information provided.    Both my husband and I were tested for any Tuber Sclerosis mutation and we have none -- it seems it was a new mutation and there is the possibility of something called gonadal mosaicism where other sperms or eggs could have been affected (1-2% chance)...I read some many folks on the internet saying they had SUA and an EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus -- hence my thinking this sounds more like this is what this is.    we had our screening tests and downs etc. were 1 in 20,000, but apparently now reduced to 1 in 300 because of potentially 2 soft markers.    My husband says forgo any amnio and they are not recommending it but do I do it for a piece of mind?What can I do to ease my mind?    What does this sound like?    This will be the longest next 3 months of my life.	2	EchoGenic IntraCardiac Focus,SUA,cardiac rhabdomyoma,tuber sclerosis	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

There is the option of IVF, but being that there's nothing wrong with me I'd prefer not to have to take all those drugs.

The 3rd one has already did preventive surgery and have both breasts removed and ovaries removed.    She did have pre cancer spots upon removal which they said would have turned into breast cancer in 1 to 2 years.    I have already had my ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.    However, have not had breast removed due to insurance coverage.    This would be considered preventive surgery and is not covered.    How important is it that I have my breast removed?

post_3360464	8	8 year old Daughter with Excessive Body hair	146	609118	Sep 03, 2008	My daughter is almost 9, and since birth, she has had an excessive amount of hair on her body.     2 years ago she was diagnosed with Sensory Integration.    I have done a lot of research on this disorder and have found and related a lot of her physical challenges to her SI condition.    She has a learning disability, and gross motor skills have been a challenge to master.    She only learned to ride a bike without training wheels this past spring.    At the age of 17 months she had to have corrective eye surgery due to her eyes crossing.     We are coping with SI with medication and physical therapy.    Another concern is this issue with excessive body hair.    We are not talking about small amounts that are an inconvenience, she asks me to shave her legs at least 2-3 times a week.    Her body hair is the consistancy of a man's hair on his legs or arms.    Even after we shave, the hair is prickly and stubbly.    The hair is not a typical females hair follicle.    She is embarrassed and takes special attention to hide her hair problem, even at the age of 9.    About a year ago, I noticed that she had developed pubic hair.    That concerns me.    She is more developed than that of my 12 year old daughter.    The hair on my 9 year olds body is mostly black (unless she has been in the pool) and course.     If this was a problem within my family with other members, I would not feel as concerned.    However, I do not have any background ethnicity that would make me find this condition somewhat normal.    One thing to note; my daughter when delivered, the physician asked me what nationality my husband was.    He is Caucasian.    Before we were discharged from the hospital, they did a few genetic tests on her because her feet and hands were "puffy".    She also had such thick body hair; they felt that the tests would be beneficial.     The blood work came back ok.     I am just concerned that we are missing a condition not picked up with normal blood work.    This could be a pituitary issue.    Especially with the learning challenges that she has been diagnosed with.     One more thing to note.....she is sick a lot.    I would say almost monthly.    Her resistance to illness is very weak!    She has been in school only 2 short weeks and already sick.    Please any assistance will help!	0	body hair	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_3297100	602080	Stay positive	146	593813	Aug 18, 2008	I also had these 2 markers on my Level II ultrasound. I worried incessantly about the possibility of Down syndrome or some other chromsomal abnormality and did not enjoy a minute of the rest of the pregnancy. Well, my adorable, healthy baby daughter Maren Brianna was born on July 18 without Down syndrome or any other issues. So, my advice is to stay positive, especially if the odds of it being a chromsomal abnormality are much lower than the odds of losing the baby in an amniocentesis. That was the case with me. I think it was 1:1200 chance of Down syndrome or another abnormality and 1:300 losing the baby if I decided to have an amnio.This discussion is related toEchogenic Foci and Choroid Plexus Cyst.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Since I have been on this board I have seen A LOT of questions concerning NF1 and the choice to have children. This may seem like a pointless question because I do know that I have a 50% chance of passing this on to a child (if I chose to have one) but it seems as if a lot of people are being told by genetics counselours that it is best NOT to have children...why is that? I've only had 2 surgeries to remove tumors and after that I have no issues with the disease. Again, it is a pointless question but I just want to know why it is reccomended for people who have NF1 to not have children	0	Tumor,Genetics	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4062902	779233	Drugs increase death rate of Alzheimer's patients	170	594690	Mar 06, 2009	Drugs increase death rate of Alzheimer's patientsThe use of anti-psychotic drugs used to treat dementia patients.First of all, a 2006 study showed that Alzheimer's patients who took these drugs had no significant improvement over placebos. We also know that these drugs can cause some serious side effects in Alzheimer's patients, such as an increased risk of stroke and respiratory issues. And another study linked the use of "atypical" antipsychotic drugs to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death √¢ Ä ì even in younger patients.Now a study shows that the anti-psychotic drugs that are commonly prescribed to treat Alzheimer's could actually double a patient's risk of dying within a few years. The lead author of this study, Clive Ballard of the Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases at King's College London, says that risk of death likely outweighs the benefit of these drugs.Well, no kidding! I have yet to see anything good come from loading these helpless elderly people up on antipsychotic drugs that were never even intended to be used in this way.Ballard's study tracked 165 Alzheimer's patients aged 67 to 100. Half continued on their course of anti-psychotics, while the other half were took placebos.At the end of two years, 71 percent of the placebo group were still alive √¢ Ä ì but only 46 percent of the group on anti-psychotics survived.After three years, just 30 percent of those taking the anti-psychotics were alive, while 59 percent of the placebo group were still going strong.Yet in spite of the increasing evidence of the dangers of these anti-psychotic drugs such as Risperdal, Thorazine, and Stelazine (as well as other derivatives like risperidone, quetiapine, and olanzapine), they racked up a staggering $14.5 billion in international sales in 2007. These are three of the top 10 best-selling drugs on the planet.These drugs were never meant to be used long-term, yet as many as 60 percent of nursing home residents with dementia are placed on anti-psychotic regimens that last as long as two years.William Thies of the Alzheimer's Association said that "at some points, some people will be better off with no medication." I doubt that's something that the Big Pharma companies that paid for this study will want to hear.DR.W.	11	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_4024357	53	53 years old and losing cognitive function. AD or something else?	170	775190	Feb 24, 2009	My mother will be 53 next month. Over the last couple of years or so, I've noticed a bit of a decline in her cognitive skills. Her memory, problem-solving and decision-making skills seem to be deteriorating a little and I worry it could be something bad. I have suggested she look into it, but she thinks she's not old enough for these to be symptoms of anything and just dismisses it as her being generally aloof. I think 53 is pretty young for alzheimers, but is there anything else it could be? Should she see a doctor?She has also recently been diagnosed with arthritis in her lower back, and has been taking tamoxifen for a few years now, following the removal of a pre-cancerous mass in her left breast. I'm not sure if any of this matters, but I'm not a doctor so I don't know what might be connected.Thank you to anyone who can help.	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_4091291	786199	Blood Test Predicts Dementia Risk	170	594690	Mar 14, 2009	Blood Test Predicts Dementia RiskA new test can help predict whether a patient will develop frontal lobe dementia (Frontotemporal Dementia or FTD). Next to Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs, FTD is the form of dementia that strikes people most frequently at a relatively young age√¢ Ä îyounger than 65.In FTD, large numbers of brain cells begin to die off in the frontal lobe, the foremost part of the brain which comprises about 30 percent of brain mass. The frontal lobe helps regulate behavior, movement, and mood, and is responsible for functions such as language. The first signs of FTD are changes in behavior and personality. In later stages, the victim suffers from memory loss.Researcher Christine Van Broeckhoven and her colleagues found that a large percentage of people who have FTD have a genetic defect in chromosome 17. Those people produce only half the normal amount of a progranulin protein, and Van Broeckhoven discovered that a shortage of this protein, which is a growth factor, leads to cells dying in the frontal lobe. Additional results indicate that a lack of progranulin also plays a role in Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).Krisel Sleegers, one of Van Broeckhoven√¢ Ä ôs scientists, has developed a test to measure the amount of progranulin in the blood. The test, which is simple and could be used on a large scale, will help doctors determine if someone is at risk of developing FTD long before symptoms appear	8	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

He has had several episodes of projectile vomiting, which, I feel is due to a blockage somewhere. He is on comfort care only. The other day, he had an episode of projectile vomiting, and swallowed some. He had a fever of 103+, which came down in 2 days. He also had fluid in both lungs. He was given oxygen, which was taken off as his saturation reached 94%. How can someone in this stage recover so quickly? Will these episodes continue? How long can someone live in this state? I live in another state, and I feel that my life is somewhat on hold, depending on what happens with him.

post_4002436	764804	rapid memory loss	170	769167	Feb 18, 2009	hiMy father is currently ill in hospital with no diagnosis.He fell ill around Xmas 2008 (7 weeks ago).    He is 64 years old.Since Xmas until around one week ago he has had fairly rapid memory loss.    Over the course of the previous week the rate of decline has rapidly increased, e.g. he does not know he is in hospital, where he lives, cannot really hold a conversation as he tends to respond with a random statement, and immediately forgets what he or you have just said.    He is also starting to have hallucinations, e.g. dogs in the hospital, and seems to be increasingly paranoid, although he is generally happy.He has had Cat scan and MRI scans, which have identified a small cyst on his pituitary gland, although the neurosurgeon thinks due to its size this may be incidental to his symptoms.    The scans do not show any change in his brain size,    they do not suggest part of his brain is dying, nor is there any sign of bleeding or of other fluid.In addition to the confusion./memory loss over the previous seven weeks he has had several "bad turns" which tend to last around a day, these symptoms include:Full body tremors (remain conscious)High (102+) temperaturesHigh Blood PressureFast pulse 120bpm+It goes without saying that all his family are extremely concerned, and would appreciate any thoughts (or experiences) people may have.He has suffered with hand tremors for approx 10 years previously, and memory has occasionally not been 100% for quite some timeThank youGavin	7	brain,rapid memory loss,cjd,LBD,lewy,alzheimer,dementia,hormone,pituitary gland,Memory,Memory loss,Cyst,MRI,Gland	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_4003311	765022	Concerns	170	769333	Feb 18, 2009	Anxietiesby Roses1358Leave a NoteSend MessageAdd as FriendRoses1358Member since Feb 2009, 35 minutes agoTags: sleepingI am writing this for my husband who is a diabetic, take Lantus daily, a kidney transplant for 11yrs,    immune suppressant drugs daily neoral-prednisone-cellcept, high blood pressure, lisinopril,metropolol, amlodipine.    Never had a problem sleeping at night, but in the last 6mos to a year developed insomnia and anxiety.    He is 85yr old male.    I was evaluated at Memory clinic with low onset alzheimers and short term memory loss.    My primary dr first gave me Rozerem which did not help, panic became more intense.    Memory clinic dr ordered Exelon patch and 50 mg Seroquel, still did not work.    After many sleepless nights and panic .25mg daily of Alprazolam together with 50mg Seroquel helped for a while.    Seems whenever there is a change in his daily routines his sleep pattern also changes. (Friend visiting overnite or family get togethers) Seroquel was increased to 100mg. with 1 Alprazolam.    His panic worse just before bedtime (10:30pm).    Since this all started he has become consumed with urinating.    Keeps saying he has to keep going, keeps jumping out of bed every few minutes, or blames his sugar is going down.    One night I did not hear him in my first sleep, got up and took his blood 13x in a matter of 1/2 hr. (it was not down).Makes all kinds of excuses to get out of bed.    Have taken him to all his doctors, including urologist (everything is OK) they tell me. Also purchased adult diapers so he would not have to get out of bed 10x in a night to urinate, wore them 1x (not happily),but since this and increase does not seem to have that anxiety.     So now we have increased Seroquel to 200mg at bedtime and 2 Alprazolam .25mg about 9pm together with all his other pills.    Neurologist is not in favor of Alprazolam but it is the only thing that makes him sleep.    I followed neurologist order for 3 days to give him    1/2 seroquel at 9pm instead of alprazolam with increased 200mg Seroquel one hour before bedtime and it was absolute disaster.    Needless to say we both were sleep deprived.    In desperation each of those 3 nights I gave him 1 alprazolam and in 15min he was asleep like a baby and slept the rest of the night.    My question is I hear so much about the addiction of alprazolam and wonder if this will work for a while again and will we have to increase it again.    How do I explain to my neurologist my concerns for his negative feelings about alprazolam?    My children say he is 85yrs old, been through much...forget the addiction if it makes him sleep.    Stopped neurolgist's order and told his nurse I was giving him 2 alpra at 9pm and we have both had 2 nights of blissful sleep. Has lost ability to take care of any financial household matters in 2yrs (did it all for 58yrs-owned his own business) Who else has any answers or do I sound like an over concerned wife of 60yrs.	13	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_3990942	761866	Is it really Alzheimer's?	170	762700	Feb 14, 2009	About 2 years ago my mother, now 80, was diagnosed with AD.    She takes Amenda (sp).    She was diagnosed by the family doc becasue she was continually making appointments for numbness in her leg.    He would treat her and give meds and she would come again and again for the same thing like she had never been.    He asked her if she was having trouble remembering and she said yes.    My dad takes care of her but he seems to minimize her symptoms.    he says "well we have some very interesting conversations".    She tells me the same stories over and over and sometimes will tell a story that happened to someone else as if it happened to her.    With that said she still drives, although not at night and not very often anymore.    Dad got her    GPS but she won't use it.    My brother lives out of state and he says there is nothing wrong with her and she is just getting older.    She worries about me and I need to call her at least twice a day or she gets anxious.    She also will not stay at family functions when it starts to get dark and even though she wants me to call her she almost always makes my dad do most of the talking.    She was over tonight and asked me about 8 times where my dog was (it was upstairs in my son's room).    Some days I am convinced she has it and it is a proper diagnosis and other days I think I am overreacting and it is OK and she is just having normal aging.    I can't get my dad to talk about it much other than he tells me he has to stay healthy because she needs him.    He just had 7 bypass surgery and I don't want him to do this alone.    I tell him we are are here to help.    Does she need more tests?    Is there a sure way to know?    Am I over worried?    My daughter-in-law's grandmother has it but she cannot go to the bathroom by herself and needs contant care.    That is what makes me think my mom is fine because she is not like that.

post_3898999	740691	rapid, sudden onset of Dementia?	170	742115	Jan 21, 2009	My grandmother has been in poor health for about three years now- she has osteoporosis, she was diagnosed and treated for lung and throat cancer three years ago, then in the past year broke her wrist, and in the fall that resulted in the broken wrist, a tumor was discovered behind her left ear, it was benign and removed. She was in a rehabilitation hospital over the summer, and was released in October to live with my aunt. Since the surgery to remove the tumor, her hearing has been really bad, even with her hearing aids we had to practically shout for her to hear us or write down what we are saying. Then about a month ago, she broke her leg and my aunt had to temporarily put her into a home, so that she would have round the clock care. I talked to grandma on Christmas day, and other than the hearing, she seemed to be very much "there" and not at all confused.I talked to her night before last, and was devastated. She didn't know who I was at all, and seemed really unaware that I was even speaking to her some of the time, even with my mother in the room with her, telling her what I was saying. She didn't seem to know my mom or aunt- she kept calling my mother Tex and she called the phone a float. I asked her if she what she was doing and she started telling me that she was driving on a really curvy road and that it was dark.    I asked if she wanted to talk to my son, and she didn't know who I was talking about. I was very much reminded of a family member (not blood related) who did have alzheimers. I know that alzheimers is a gradual thing though. What can cause this rapid mental regression (over a period of only three weeks)?	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_3838981	2	2 Cardiovascular Proteins Tied to Severity of Alzheimer's	170	594690	Jan 05, 2009	2 Cardiovascular Proteins Tied to Severity of Alzheimer'sTheir interaction cuts blood flow to brain, limiting its ability to shed plaques(HealthDay News) -- U.S. researchers have spotted two proteins that deliver a double hit to the brain function of Alzheimer's disease patients.The proteins -- SRF (serum response factor) and myocardin -- lessen blood flow in the brain and reduce the rate at which the brain is able to remove amyloid beta, the protein that accumulates in damaging quantities in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, say a team from the University of Rochester.The findings provide firm evidence directly linking two processes believed to play a role in Alzheimer's: a reduction in blood flow and a buildup of toxic amyloid beta. The interaction between the two proteins could prove an effective target for treatment.The researchers said they were surprised to discover that two proteins known for their role in the cardiovascular system were major factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease.The study was published online Dec. 21 in the journal Nature Cell Biology."This is quite unexpected," senior author and Rochester neuroscientist Dr. Berislav Zlokovic, said in a journal news release. "On the other hand, both of these processes are mediated by the smooth muscle cells along blood vessel walls, and we know that those are seriously compromised in patients with Alzheimer's disease, so perhaps we shouldn't be completely surprised."More informationThe U.S. National Institute on Aging has more about Alzheimer's disease.-- Robert PreidtSOURCE: University of Rochester, news release, Dec. 21, 2008	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_3735783	704496	Meds for short-term memory loss	170	702488	Dec 04, 2008	My mom and I are concerned about my 74 year-old father.    He has been experiencing short-term memory loss for the past 3 years.    This spring, my mom took him to the doctor for a series of tests.    They conducted an MRI to check for tumors or a possible stroke.    They also conducted an initial screening for Alzheimers and dementia.    Everything came back clear.    The doctors agreed that there is some short-term memory loss but not enough to warrant medication.A typical example of the type of memory loss he is experiencing includes the following:My husband, daughter and I recently met up with my mom and dad for a vacation in Florida.    We flew in and rented a car for the trip.    My father asked at least once a day if we liked our new car.    We patiently told him we did not buy the car - it was a rental.    It seems like new information doesn't get filed away correctly in his memory bank and, like a broken record, he keeps repeating his thoughts.My mom and I are wondering the following: 1) if there are any medications my father could be taking to help improve his memory, and 2) whether his current combination of medication may be affecting his memory.    He is currently on zocor (20ml/day) for cholesterol, methotrixate and folic acid for psoriasis, and takes a 81 mg aspirin per day to help thin his blood.    He had a pacemaker installed in 1993 (updated in 2002).Any thoughts or suggestions as to what we might explore with the doctors would be helpful.

post_3739274	705318	In-Home Care Cost	221	703283	Dec 05, 2008	My father, a long-time paraplegic with diabetes, just learned that he will have to be bed-bound for the rest of his life on account of skin ulcers that will not heal.    He is torn between resigning himself to a nursing home for the rest of his life (which could be another year or another 40 -- he's in his 50s now) and just going back home, where he lives alone, and doing whatever he wants until an infection kills him.    This would probably happen in 1-2 years at the latest, based on his medical history.    I've been trying to convince him to give the nursing home a shot for a year or two so my husband and I can buy a house near our family and move him in with us (living in his house is not an option, nor would it save money -- he owes more on it than it's worth).    We're both 27, and we currently live in a small apartment 1500 miles away from him.    What I'd like to know is how much in-home caregivers tend to cost, per hour, or what the range is.    My husband and I both work full-time, and my father has a set amount of money for aid and attendance from the government.    I had assumed his income would be enough for someone to come in a few hours a day, change the dressing on his wounds, and make him lunch, but the more I learn, the more expensive and impossible everything sounds.    Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

post_4109051	790590	Help!	221	529109	Mar 19, 2009	I'm a caregiver to my elderly parents. My mum is in remission for cancer. I have days when I feel especially moody due to certain problems at work or with friends, and would just sit in a corner and cry, I feel isolated from my friends as many of them are preoccupied with their own lives and I can't really count on them to hear me talk out my problems.Sometimes, I feel anxious when I have to socialise and eat at public places. I have shared some of my feelings with my counsellor, however, things have not gotten any better. I feel that I am beginning to lose interest in keeping touch with people other than my few close friends.As I'm the sole breadwinner, I have not approached a doctor about this as I am apprehensive about my problems affecting my employment opportunities.Just wondering if anyone else here has had to take care of both their parents alone. And if so, would you be able to share your thoughts with me about how to manage the responsibility?As my parents are much older than me, I also often feel very afraid that I may lose them.	10	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_4129097	795330	What to do....	221	804102	Mar 25, 2009	My 79 year old mother was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer on March 5th...and was given a "limited life expectancy." For the past 18 years (since my father passed away) she has been living with me and we have an amazing relationship but we live in a tri-level home and due to her condition my family was worried about her being here with the stairs. She stayed home for the first week and was doing well...getting stronger every day. My brother and his family wanted her to come out to Arizona with him because his wife is a stay at home mom and we thought being around the grandchildren would be good for my mom. He talked to my mom and she agreed. The two of us flew out there on March 13th and I was there for about a week getting her adjusted. After about 72 hours there she started to go downhill.....she is miserable! She told me she would rather die than stay there.    She is not eating and getting weaker and weaker. Every time I talk to her she tells me that she "Just wants to come home"...I am also missing her terribly and I am willing to try to make arrangements to bring her back home. My worry is that I work full time and could not be with her during the day. I really want to bring her home though...i think she deserves to be where she wants to be now.

post_4099013	788158	Other young couples in caregiver situations due to chronic illness?	221	612876	Mar 16, 2009	Hey, I'm wondering if there are other young couples (late 20's, early 30's perhaps) trying to balance caregiver/patient roles vs. keeping their relationship young, fresh, and romantic.    I'm not finding many role models to guide how we should navigate this . . . it seems little of the information we find on caregiver issues applies to our situation.    The one book I read on young people with chronic illness really sugar-coated the relationship aspect of it as if it were only natural for the trials and tribulations we go through to bring us closer.    In a way, yes.    But, we live in the real world, and dealing with the intrusions of home health care, the demands of doctor visits, the strains of trips to the emergency room and hospital stays, and just the day-to-day caregiver stuff . . . that all puts a strain on things and doesn't let you live the life you imagined for yourselves at this age.    I would love to talk to others in this situation.    I'm not the caregiver, but that patient, so I hope it's not inappropriate for me to post here.    The two of us are trying to work together on finding balance in our relationship, and having a relationship that exists beyond the confines of my illness.    I'm posting on behalf of the two of us.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

Yet she insists on walking to the store(with her cane) while im at work. the store is about 2 minutes driving distance, but not a safe road. She claims she goes there for the paper, but in reality she goes to get a pack of cigarettes. Ive caught her with candy (which is not gluten free) so it is like poison to her body. As mad and frustrated as I get and tell her this is no good for her, she's going to do what she wants anyway. She gets medical transportation when Im at work, she has a nurse come to the house once a month to give her a b12 shot and then a nurse comes once a week to help her clean, since I am so busy with everything, and taking care of her its hard to get things done. She's killing herself and it hurts me and drives me nuts that she doesnt seem to care about her own health, I care more than she does. she only 48 and we're close.

post_3970676	757107	Caring for Aging Parents	221	760293	Feb 09, 2009	Families, professionals, learner-friendly presentations, exhibits, and dynamic collaborative opportunities make up the focus of this conference which will include a chance to schedule interviews for the Caregiver/CareSeeker Match or Ask the Experts.    The practical nature of this event addresses pressing needs of families who are faced with the challenge of providing care to their parents at home. The conference needs companies that will form new partnerships that support through sponsorships and the exhibit of products and/or services beneficial to the elderly. Join us in Orange Park, Florida May 14-15, 2009. Be part of the conference that is for everyone by 'Bridging Resources with CareSeekers and changing the landscape of caregiving.The conference grew out of the role my siblings and I assumed in the care of our parents, especially Dad who had a progressive lung disease and a neurological disorder.    The challenges we faced seemed daunting.    Frequently, we asked the following questions:    "What do I do?"    "How can I do everything and still provide the care Dad needs?"    "When do I take a break?"     After many discussions with physicians, physician assistants, pharmacists and social workers, we realized that this seemed to be par for the course.    Even those in the medical profession who assumed the caregiving role of their parents indicated concern about the time commitment needed, finding quality caregivers and getting it all done in 24 hours.    In spite of all of the information available, many are not prepared to care for their parents in a seamless manner when reality hits that the parents' health and level of independence may be compromised.We found creative ways to organize each day, meet our parents' needs that sometimes changed within minutes and communicated info for their timely care with physicians and other caregivers.    We experienced the gamut of emotions as we experienced the constant changes in Dad who remained cognitively intact until he expired.    Many of the assessment and communication forms we created were included in the chapters I wrote about aging parents.	0	parents,parent,caring,aging,caregivers,family,Lung,neurological,nature,medical,question	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

I took control of dr visits, specialist, everything. He,continued to drink. We, i use ''we'' because i do all research, all answeres to dr. EVERYTHING! My life is his life.WE have been thru 3 evulations at UCLA. The one this spring, he pulled a muscle in his lung, and it was catch up all summer. I'm doing all these things knowing he is not going to get a liver, his only hope. why should he? He still drinks some, not as much because it finally makes him so sick. There are so many other ppl out there who would not abuse a new liver, and ,sadly, i don't know,if he would, but i think so. I know he is running out of time. I'm in this alone,most family members don't know he still drinks. So, i enlighten them. He is ready to leave this world,he is sick every day. and so tired. Many days he never gets out of bed. I also care alot for 3 of my grandkids. My daughter has Valley Fever, and summers are hard for her. But, she makes life hard forhehself too. I guess my question is, how do i let go? I know God is in charge of that. I also believe God's got something for him to finish and he wont open his heart and eyes to HIM. Maybe i just need a place of my own to vent some of this,whatever i have.A place where other ppl are going thru some of the same things?

post_3790996	716478	Have to put mom in long term care	221	209646	Dec 19, 2008	Hi, I'm 40, single and have been a caregiver, while working full time, for my elderly frail mom (age 77) who has COPD (and has been on 24 hr oxygen for the last 10 years), and Schizo-affective disorder.    She recently became very weak after repeated UTI's and could no longer walk on her own with her walker as she has normally been able to do.    When I took her to the hospital where I was sure they would admit her, the dr refused to admit her to hospital and made me put her in respite care within our local LTC facility.    I've come to the realization that it's time for her to be in LTC and although I've been gearing up for it for the last year (I knew it was coming), it's definitly tougher than I thought.    I've been gearing her up for it, and she's been okay with it so far.    They at least at my insistence ran some bloodwork and discovered her hemoglobin is very low at 89 and I had to insist to her dr that he do some further testing to find out where she's losing blood.    While I know she's too frail to receive treatment if it's a serious illness (cancer, anything requiring surgery) it could be something easily treatable.    I'm having a lot of trouble with the dr. wanting to do tests and actually treat her with iron supplements to boost her iron level.    Is this a common thing with drs and LTC patients?    I was shocked and dismayed at her normally helpful family dr.Anyway, a bad week at a bad time.    At least she looked and sounded better when I visited today.Debbie	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_4096035	787422	Absence Seizures and Dementia	1465	794899	Mar 16, 2009	My mom is 57 and has just been diagnosed with absence seizures.    Over the last two years she has also been experiencing some memory loss.    She has been attributing the memory issues to menopause.    However, in the last couple of months, she has become more concerned about her memory, due to more episodes of "fogginess", forgetting names, situations etc.    This has led to increased anxiety and worry.    She is just awaiting her next appointment with her neurologist.    I have been trying to do some research regarding the link between adult onset epilepsy and dementia.    Is there a link?    Is it possible that the memory issues are being compounded by her anxiety about them, or could they be related to menopause?As you can imagine, we are very concerned, especially since she is very young to be having these kinds of symptoms.	1	absence seizures,dementia,Menopause	None

post_3986263	760777	Small fetal head:Genetic or something wrong? What do you think? Picture Links Inc...	146	763771	Feb 13, 2009	I am having ultrasounds done every three weeks in a high-risk perinatal assesment facility due to an unknown cervical mass that may have been the cause for spotting early in my pregnacy. However, the mass now cannot be seen on ultrasound at 28 weeks yet another cause for concern has arisen. During my 25 week ultrasound it was noted that the female fetal head was lagging behind in growth (about the 8th percentile) while the rest of her body was growing normally. Now at 28 weeks her head is still behind in growth (one measurment three weeks behind and the other four) while her body is measuring normal for 28 weeks! There are no other markers of a problem during ultrasound and none found in genetic testing\counceling (quad screen). Her brain structure appears normal and I was told not to worry but at the same time it was suggested that I have a fetal MRI and\or amnio-centisis. I am very concerned about the outcome of this finding and would like to know what the odds are that this will eventually become a diagnosis of microsephaly? and the odds are of her head catching up in third trimester growth?MD. Response:Doctor's Answer by Elaine Brown, MDFeb 12, 2009 11:55PMTo: NeedSecondOpinionHi!The biggest problem with doing tests is that very often something "incidental" is found which leads to lots more tests.Microcephaly is defined as a head circumference which is more than three standard deviations below the normal range.    I don't know if your baby's head meets criteria for that, and I'm going to bet it doesn't.Fetal position can have a lot to do with head measurements. If the baby's head is down really deep into the mom's pelvis, the head can be compressed and look smaller than it really is-- having the MRI wil help sort this out.You don't mention any of the major causes of mircrocephaly which also makes it less likely.    Also, you don't mention any other abnormalities which might be part of a syndrome--and    an islolated finding is less likely to be serious.Its your call on the amnio--but they are not too bad when done by    a high risk specialist,It is probably worth the peace of mind to do it.Finally, does anyone in the family have a small head?    Findings like these are often familial.It sounds like your team intends to follow up on the finding, and not just leave you hanging.    Trust your docs and ask lots of questions.Most likely, your baby will be perfect.    What is her name?Good luck!Dr BMy response:To: Elaine Brown, MDThank you soooooooo much for your input Dr. B! Her name is Tempest Rae. : )    My doctors agree that she does'nt meet the criteria for microsephaly but also stated that they could'nt tell me 100% that she does'nt have a problem in there. One said that smaller head size can mean smaller brain. I'm not sure if a fetal MRI can diagnose something like that. Furthermore, she has not been in the head down position when these measurments were being considered. As for a small head being familial I would'nt necessarily consider the father of my babys head small but rather elongated and maybe somewhat pointed while he is 6' 2" and very thin(always has been). I must say it is of rather odd shape! lol. As for her older sibling, almost 3 years now, I must addmit that her head is noteably small & elongated as well but proportionate with her small but long body in my opinion. People often comment on how tall and thin she is. At her last pediatric appointment I recall she was in the 10th or 20th% for weight and 70% for height. Head was within normal range but I have not been informed of this measurment lately (now don't I wonder!). I don't know if this has any real relevance in the matter at hand but here are some picture links to make judgement of head size in my unborn childs family(hope it works):http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=46254&imageID=15669986http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=1412605&imageID=19679161http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=1412605&imageID=19679163http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=387082899&albumID=46254&imageID=16228441	1	small fetal head,microsephaly	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_4080982	783644	Hemochromatosis Testing - Is it Necessary??	146	597354	Mar 11, 2009	My father is 74 and was just told he has hemochromatosis.    It's so bad that it will take at least a year to get the levels at respectable place.    I don't know much about it but the oncologist said he has BOTH genes??    He also told me and my four brothers, our children and my father's siblings we should all be tested for the disorder.    My mother tested negative.    I asked my dr. and my endo and they said I didn't need to be - the oncologist disagrees.    Why can't everyone agree on what should be a pretty standard answer??    Now my daughter's dr. (who is also mine) tested her.    They told me because I wasn't having any more children, no point.    I find that odd.    hahaMy dad also has non-hodgkins lymphoma so treating him for this has not been easy. He has low blood pressure and his hemoglobin levels are low after weekly bleeds so it's going to be a long time before he is better.    He has to skip weeks because of it so that just puts him further behind on the treatment.    It's so bad that he has significant liver damage and bad Ascites.My question again is "Do I need to be tested for the gene or just have regular iron and ferritin level checks?"    Seems pretty simple to me.This discussion is related toHemochromatosis.	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I mean, I don't even look like him and all of my friends know this. I tried to ask my mom for a paternity test, but she just said, 'No.' I tried to ask her questions about the man whom I think is my real dad, (questions such as 'Why did he die?'). Her voice cracked and I saw a tear slide down her face as she told me it was drugs. I honestly don't think the man is married is my dad. I mean--I'm not one bit like him, his whole side of the family treats me like I'm an alien, I don't look like him, plus there is a good possibilty that I am bipolar. And his family has no history of mental diseases or disorders. To top it off, he treats me like **** on a day-to-day basis.But my question is this: How can I get them to take a paternity test? I don't want a court one, but an at-home one. So, anyway how I can do it? I have been thinking about ordering one, telling them that its an allergy test (so they'll actually do it), and mailing off to the company who makes it. Also, are there any good, accurate paternity test out there I can get?

She said it is the metabolized form of folic acid and it doesn't matter if you have the MTHFR gene or the A1298C mutations or both.    It will bypass these.    She said it is new and everyone should take it that has a family history of this or has had these problems before.    Have you heard of this?

I have had 2 doctors in the past ask if I had ever been diagnosed with the syndrome, the first was because the doctor noticed my class 3 jaw ( I am due to have surgery on this) as far as I am aware this is not a sign of Marfan's the second doctor said it because of my height and slimish build. I am 22 years old, 6 ft 2 inches.I became so paranoid about me having this that I saw a cardiologist who performed an ECG and echocardiogram. Both came back clear, he said the valves were normal and the cardic structure and function were completely normal. I do not have a deformed chest, my sternum is every so slightly indented. No one in my family has ever been diagnosed with Marfan's. My brother, cousins and uncles are all around my height.I feel as thought I am being victimised to an extent as doctors seem to be judging me on my height, which I don't think is THAT tall anyhow. I am not hypermobile, do not have flat feet or exagerated arches. I think my palate is a little high but it is not arched at all ( asked a maxillofacial surgeon).	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I am soon to be gentically tested for Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH).My question may seem very strange but i after researching i have found nothing and hope someone here may have some answers.My parents took the news very bad and i overheard them saying that `it will all come out now` and that i might `leave them or maybe even hang myself`. They said they must do everything they can to cover this up.I know this sounds very very strange, but i know they were not jokin, they did not know they were there and i really really fear that they are not telling me something.Something that will come up on a genetics test that i do not know about.Any ideas what it could be. There is no dangerous genetic disorders that runs in my family, all of my family on both sides have lived to good ages.I believe it could be something to do with my birth maybe. I am a triplet and my parents were married for ten years before they had children.

We have been reviewing donor profiles, and have found a couple of donors we really like, however in there are concerns with their family medical histories.Donor #1- His donor profile indicates both his paternal grandmother (at age 60) and maternal grandfather (at age 64) died of bone cancer. The donor profile does not list the specific type of bone cancer. My questions are:1. Is bone cancer hereditary?2. What are the odds that our child would develop/have bone cancer (provided there are no other risk factors)?We really like this donor, but just seeing the words 'bone cancer' has us really scared.Donor #2 - His donor profile indicates he has a cousin with down syndrome. I just turned 36 two weeks ago, which I know increases my odds of having a child with down's syndrome anyway. Does the donor's cousin having DS increase my odds of having a child with DS even greater?I would really appreciate hearing your expertise/insights to help us with making this decision.Thank you!	0	TTC,Cancer,down,Down's Syndrome,Genetics	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

His MRI showed than the corpus callosum was underdeveloped (but within the range of normal).    He has an irregular and strong heart beat but once again (within the range of normal).    He has very long toes but otherwise is small (height and weights for his age - less than 5%).    He has a significant speech delay although he is able to communicate and be understood.    He has had a history of behavior problems since his adoption ranging from rages for 2-3 hours and more (when adopted - 3 years old) which have now improved to be more like aggitation/moodiness/impulsive and obsessive-compulsive (although much of the time he seems perfectly "normal" and happy).    In addition, he had significant coordination and balance issues but now plays sports (basketball and football).    He is having difficulty learning to read although he can read at about a 1st grade level.    He has never been officially diagnosed with anything other than ADHD and Mild MR.    Should we pursue having him go through genetic testing?    Any information you could provide would be appreciated.    By the way, we don't know much about his biological mother but we do know that she had very short stature (4'1") and although never tested was thought to be retarded.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Through a friend on another discussion board, I learned about a genetic test which may help predict if Tamoxifen therapy will be beneficial to me.    This person referred to it as a "Tamoxifen resistance test" due from my reading on PubMed, it appears that it is actually based on the type of metabolizer you are based on certain phenotypes.    My ethnic background is German and Swedish, so Northern/Western European.    I'm wondering if any of you have taken this test?    I am will to pay for it out of my own pocket if it shows that this treatment, with all of its side effects, would basically be worthless in my body.    If you had the test, what was the name of your test procedure and how much did it cost, at which lab?    My doctor has never ordered this on any of her patients and I would be the "test subject".

Until now, the reasons for that variance have been unclear.Plavix "targets a very important receptor on platelets, but people vary substantially in how good an anti-clotting effect they have" from the drug, explained Dr. Robert F. Storey, from the Cardiovascular Research Unit at the University of Sheffield School of Medicine in the United Kingdom. He is also the author of an accompanying comment in the journal."The variation in response is partly due to genetics, but there are other factors such as age which influence the response," Storey said.For the study, a team led by Dr. Gilles Montalescot, from the Hopital Pitie-Salpetriere in Paris, collected data on 259 patients aged 45 and younger who suffered a first heart attack and were given Plavix.Among these patients, 28 percent carried a gene variation called CYP2C19*2. This variation is common among the western population and even more common in Asia, the researchers noted.During an average of a year of follow-up, patients with the gene variation were more than three-and-a-half times more likely to die, have another heart attack or require additional cardiac treatment compared to those without the variation, the researchers found.In addition, patients with CYP2C19*2 were six times more likely to have a blockage in a stent they had received after a heart attack.Moreover, the variation continued to cause heart problems up to eight years after treatment with Plavix. In fact, patients with the variation were four times more likely to suffer additional heart problems after receiving the blood thinner.So, what can be done to minimize the risk? "Checking people's genetic make-up after a heart attack is probably not necessary, since it may be better to do a different blood test to see if they have had a good anti-clotting response to clopidogrel," Storey said. He added that "new treatments that work more reliably than clopidogrel should hopefully be available within the next year or so."Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, noted that treatment with Plavix in combination with aspirin does greatly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients after an acute coronary event, or in patients undergoing coronary stent placement."However, it is well recognized there is variable response to clopidogrel, and some patients have thrombotic events, despite treatment with aspirin and clopidogrel," Fonarow said. "If these findings can be confirmed in additional studies, genetic testing may be useful in personalizing the choice and dosing of anti-platelet therapy in cardiovascular patients," he said.Two other recent studies also found problems with Plavix in some patients.In one study of 259 people treated with Plavix, published in the Aug. 12 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers found that patients who smoked had significantly less clot formation than nonsmokers.In a second study, published in the Oct. 28 online edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Austrian researchers found that calcium channel blockers drugs, widely prescribed to lower blood pressure, might reduce the Plavix' anti-clotting effects.More informationFor more on Plavix, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.SOURCES: Robert F Storey, M.D., Cardiovascular Research Unit, University of Sheffield School of Medicine, U.K.; Gregg C.

I do not have cataracts and neither does her father(there is NO history in his family).

My grandfather had ten children-none of them were born with cataracts and only three offspring from the ten were born with cataracts.    My father had four children -none of them were born with cataracts.    However--- my father must have been a carrier and passed the carrier status on to me.    I have been reading much about dominant recesssive genes etc etc.    I'm not getting the understanding I would like.    My little girls doctor thinks the condition to be hereditary.

post_3789774	716215	marrying cousins and genetic problems	146	714844	Dec 19, 2008	I was researching on the internet about recessive genes and this site caught my eye. My friend has married her second cousin (since its ok to do so within her culture). However, she has realized that the guy√¢ Ä ôs grandma and her grandfather are siblings and his parents (mom n dad) are first cousins as well. However, no one in either side of the family has any problems related to genes. I know that the more u repeat inner marraiges the higher the chances are to get a recessive gene. So would there be a higher chance that her kids might be abnormal?

post_3787562	1298	Homozygous MTHFR A1298C	146	714380	Dec 18, 2008	Hi, I was diagnosed with Homozygous MTHFR A1298C when I delivered my 29 weeks old baby girl, who had stopped moving and her heart rate had declined, after an emergency c-section. The Pathological exam of placenta suggested maternal thrombophilia and further tests showed that i had homozygous MTHFR mutation.Since than I have seen a Heamatologist, who thinks the mutation is not a problem as long as my homocystiene levels are normal. My physician felt that I should be an Baby asprin 81mg, but heamatologist didnt feel the need, and asked me to stop taking it as that was causing bruising on my body.1) My question is what should be the treatment protocol for preventing further loss when I try to concieve(conceive)and I get pregnant.2) What exactly does this diagnosis means and what am at risk to.3) Also while reading about the mutation online I came across articles relating this particular muation with schizophernia and diabetic nephropathy.5) Also what would be the medical implications of this mutation on my children.6) Should all the members of my family get tested and consult doctors.7) Should I get regular exam to check my homocystiene levels.Would really appreciate if all my questions could be answered.ThanksShikha	0	Pregnancy	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

However, two surgeons agree that she will not require surgery on her skull but because she has face asymmetry she needs to see a craniofacial surgeon. Her neurologist couldn't tell be looking at her if her right eye is smaller than the left or it it is bone structure. He suggested that I take her to a pediatric opthamologist while I am waiting for the appointment with the craniofacial surgeon. I took her to a pediatric opthamologist yesterday and he said they eye itself seems to be the same size but that there is another problem. She appears to have cataracts in both eyes. He will have to do surgery on her next week also to remedy clogged tear ducts and to get a better eye exam while she us under anesthesia. I asked him what he thought was most likely the cause for cataracts in infants and he said he suspected a metabolic disorder and that I needed to call my pediatrician and her her order blood work. Of course I came home and googled the information and was not comforted by what I read. I am wondering if anybody knows which disorders ore most commonly associated with congenital cataracts?	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I noticed my 6 yr old's unusual eye lids when she was born.    I work in eye care so I was probably predisposed to noticing this, lol.    Her eyes watered a great deal and I could tell her lower lids were a little odd and the inner canthi didn't look quite normal.    But none of her doctors ever seemed to be concerned, including our eye doctor, and I never brought it up.The other day she asked me to paint her finger and toe nails and for the first time I noticed the 4th toe of each foot is noticably short.    Her toe nails also seem a little clubbed on each toe, but the 4th toes especially.We've dealt with some developmental issues that had to do with over-sensitivities to clothing tags and sock seams, as well as an intolerance for being bounced around, etc.    The ped even looked into her having something called sensory integration dysfunction.    It was investigated, but discarded as a diagnosis eventually.    It was also suspected she had some visual problems since she turns her head to focus on things closely, etc.    But aside from a fairly mild glasses prescription, the eye doc thought she was ok and would outgrow this head tilt habit.She is in the second half of her k'garten year and we have dealt with a few learning issues, but nothing really severe so far.I have read everything I can find on disorders that might result in both epicanthal folds and short 4th toes, but so far the only ones I can find report severe mental retardation and other physical traits she does not display.Does anyone know if there is a disorder that has these two specific traits?

The nursing staff claim that it keeps him from being agitated.     It however, leaves him in a catatonic state.     He cannot speak and he sits and nods off with his pupils like pinholes.     They claim this is for his "safety"    and that of the nursing staff.    I find this hard to believe because he is confined to a wheelchair    and cannot stand on his own.    He is a relatively weak person,    his muscles atrophied several years ago.    I have requested the doctor refrain from this chemical lobotomy but am being met with resistance.    I know that current research suggests that risperdal is infact harmful to use with dementia patients.    Has anyone had a similar experience?     I would prefer to be able to talk with my father in his final years (even if he doesn't recognize me) rather than look at someone who resembles Nicholson in the final scene of Cuckoo's nest.

Evenually, in May of 2008 he went to see a NeuroPsyc. where he was diagnosed with ADHD.    He did not receive any Meds until December.    He is an Engineer Assistant for a large utility company.    In August of 2008 he received his first warning in 10 years for poor communication, not following through ect.. I didn't find out about the warning until March.    In April he had an MRI and went to see a Nuerologist, who put him on Aricept as a precaution, and starting running tests for Alzhiemer.    He also went back to the NeuroPsyc for a second evalution which showed his memory had improved but his cognition was only at 30% now.    Since then we have had a PET Scan which showed syptoms(symptoms)of Early Onset Alzhiemers.    He lost 30 lbs. on the Aricept with no change in his mental state.    He is having severe headaches, hand tremors. balance problems, nasea, mood issues as well as thought processing.    There are times where he looks very pasty.    We went to a Psyciatrist last Thursday.    He has taken him off of Adderall(adderrall)and Straterra and He will start Cymbalta 60 mg. and Lamital today.     He is on sick leave until July.    We have no action plan right now.    We are not scheduled to go back to the Nuerologist until July.    His symptoms have gotten incresing worse in the last week.

post_4480850	955133	Possible help & peace for all of you who care for or love someone with Alzhei...	170	401786	May 19, 2009	Although I have not worked for several years, and have forgotten much, I am still a nurse.    I chose to work with the elderly, and so, I often cared for those with Alzeimer's Disease, both young AND old actually.I learned a few things during that time, and I wanted to pass some things on to you all, that might help you and your loved one.Although the memory of someone suffering from A.D. is affected, their long-term memory is usually intact.    This can be a great asset to use to connect with them and to give THEM some peace.    Caregivers need to remember that someone with A.D. can not only be confused, but so scared.    Their world no longer makes sense to them, and if you are trying to reorient them, this only serves to make them more agitated and and frightened.    When your loved one is agitated, try talking about their lives long ago.    They often still have these memories, and you might even learn something about your loved one that you didn't know.    Ask how they met their mate, and get details about their dates and such.    If your mother or other female loved one suffering is hell-bent on wondering where for instance, her baby is, rather than telling her her baby is all grown up, please try telling her that her baby is safe.    Tell her something like, "Mom, I'm sorry I forgot to tell you but So-and-so (a trusted person) has the baby b/c she missed her so, or is buying her new shoes, or whatever makes sense in your situation.It is very upsetting when your relative no longer recognizes you.    You feel so alone and disconnected from them.    You may not have the relationship with them that you once did, but you CAN still connect with them.    This is an example of looking at the glass as being half-full.    Keep with those long-term memories your loved one still has and connect with your relative on THAT basis.    You may hear things that are just charming, or allow you to see your relative in a whole new light....a light that you'd never have seen if they hadn't got A.D.Above all, just be as patient as you can and remember that becoming disoriented is a frightening experience.    Since your loved one will not recover his or her memory, it serves no purpose to try to re-orient them...Use what you can, and try to bring some sense of peace to them and learn to connect with them in a new way.    Also, please remember to take care of yourself.    Places that provide respite care, so you can have a break, whether regularly scheduled or just once in a while, can do you a world of good.Jacqui	8	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Last night on the phone he was so clear and knew who I was and wanted to "go home".    Why does this happen.    One moment he is in "la la land" and the next moment he is so clear.

post_4632833	992622	Sundown syndrome	170	960200	Jul 07, 2009	My best friend Female) of almost 50 years is experiencing , what seems to be sundowners syndrome. She is 60 years old and there aren't any other symptons that would lead me to think that she has early-onset AD. She is, however suffering from job-related stress. It seems that around 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening, she begins to have trouble focusing on conversations and some strange episodes of memory loss. Without being too wordy, I'll try to describe a few examples:1) As she started to take a loaf of bread out of a grocery sack, her stepson asked her if she had bought bread, to which she replied "No, I'm sorry. I forgot." By this time, she was holding the bread in full view.2)My husband and I were at her (and her husband's) house for a short visit. We were there for about 30 minutes just sitting and talking. After the 30 minutes she and I went into the kitchen for something and after about 2 minutes she asked if I wanted to stay for a few minutes- as if I had just walked in the door.3) At a 4th of July cookout at her house the other day, I put out a container of strawberries and some chocolate dipping sauce. Her older sister and I were discussing its decadance (my friend right ther looking into the container of strawberries). Her sister remarked how good they (the strawberries) looked to which my friend remarked "mmm- what are they? Her sister made a joke out of it and just gave me a quizzical glance.In addition to these examples, when evening rolls around, she also gets a blank look on her face with kind of a painted-on smile and seems to have medium degree of    difficulty keeping up with conversations (i.e short, uncertain responses, very little vocal contributions, etc.)What I'm wondering is, could this be stress-related sundowning or something else? Her short-term memory seems fine and her only health issues are arthritis and obesity as well as complaing os always being tired and stressed out from work- nursing in a private practice. Any suggestions?

post_4540286	970002	Am I having Alzheimer's disease???	170	930651	Jun 07, 2009	Hi allI am 30 years old female, doctor by profession . I have been suffering from this strange irritating problem (unbearable now) since my childhood that I forget minor things very easily specially the tasks assigned to me by someone else. I had always been a brilliant student all my life. I could easily remember the subject in examinations if I studied hard, otherwise I did have some problem retaining it. But if I have the concept I grab everything easily. I shall give you a few examples of my forgetfulness. believe me I never do that intentionally. I try my best not to forget.1. If someone used to ask me to bring my maths copy in the school the next day, I used to forget for many days unless I wrote it on my hand or something like that.2.    If someone tells me to bring something back while driving home, I forget, no matter how imporant that is.3. I forget to take my important documents with me if I am going to apply for anything like visa, job or important things like that.4. I forget to take my clinic keys if they are in a separate keyring other than the car keys'. And this happens almost 5/6 times a week if the keys are in a separate keyring.5. Now I have started forgetting the patient's name if I ask in the beginning of a session and I dont write it on the prescription , I have to ask it again :( I am so upset.6. I forget something everyday , lie I promise to call a friend after 15 mins and I forget. I forget to turn off the stove if I put something for cooking in the kitchen.In short, I forget all short term matters. I cant recall few simple words told to me by my brother. My long term memory is very good. Many friends of mine and my family had been very supportive but don't know how to deal with my inlaws with this problem. I look quite weak, dont look healthy and had very sensitive temprament all my life. I used to cry over small and big issues a lot. Now I ve reduced crying    a lot . I used to argue a lot over things which    have reduced a lot as well. Overall I am much more stable emotionally now but more upset with my forgetfulness. Despite of crying over small matters easily I had been very cheerful and like to be happy and witty.Do I have dementia?or Alzheimer's disease? if yes I am so much afraid that there is no diagnostic test available before I die ...any other problem    with me? how could I be so careless all my life?Why do I forget the special tasks only?what should I do?:o(amber	18	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_4581342	979940	Shaking/Tremors in my head for many years	170	676341	Jun 20, 2009	Hi to all, I am a 30 year old male and I have been having this problem for many years now. I have some sort of shaking/vibration in my head and I am not sure where exactly it comes from. It severely affects my concentration and I have been unable to hold down a job. Sometimes it results in a crippling headache, other times I feel nauseous. I have tried to do some face exercises like clenching my jaw tightly and shaking my head but it wouldn't relieve the shaking. Due to the shaking/vibration i my head, I find it very hard to focus and do even some simple tasks. I ever had a CT scan done many years ago but it showed nothing. Basically I just feel like I will just have to live with this all my life. The problem becomes more servere when I am subject to stress. I am really at a lost as to how I can find a way to allievate this incessant shaking in my head. I can't concentrate on doing something for any long period of time. I also have a history of depression/OCD but I don't think it is the cause of this shaking. I almost feel like there is something shaking/shivering in my head and I am sure its not psychological. Many people tell me it is but after suffering for 10 years, I am sure its not. I am a very light smoker and these few days when I try to stop smoking completely, the shaking comes back. I sometimes feel so alone, and I know not many people understand what I am going through because I look normal on the outside. I also have problems doing some simple tasks at times like having enough focus to hold up a bowl of hot soup and place it properly on the table... It feels like there is this cloud over my brain that disturbs my focus...Please share any ideas or suggestions that you may have. Take care.	11	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_4558172	974310	loss of chewing ability	170	768761	Jun 12, 2009	My father is in the final stages of dementia. He can no longer hold anything or walk. He quit speaking about 4 years ago. I just was recently told that he no longer chews. This has been for about 6 weeks. His food is thickened so he can swallow it. He has lost about 20 pounds in 5 months. His albumin level is 2.7, and 2.5 is sometimes the criteria for hospice care. My question is, how much longer before he loses his ability to swallow? He has aspirated a few times, but no pneumonia, even though there is fluid in his lungs. I would appreciate any help anyone can give me, any time guidelines, though I know each case is different. I have children and a very stressful job and live far away, and it is hard to be there until close to his death.

post_4558082	974283	Is it even possible?	170	936333	Jun 12, 2009	Hi! I am seventeen and I honestly don't think I have Alzheimer's disease. However, I've been having some problems for the last year or two that I am unsure how to categorize. I have memory loss, i.e. My favorite teacher that I'd had for two years was giving a presentation, and I looked at her and could not remember who she was. I knew I knew her, but I couldn't think of her name or where I knew her from. And another time, we were going to my uncle's house to deliver some dog food and we went and made a quick stop there. About twelve minutes later, I asked my mom when we were going to go to my uncle's house and she asked if I was joking. When I told her I wasn't, she informed me we were just there. And I got it then, but it was a few moments. I forget where I put stuff, due dates for schoolwork, etc. I also feel very numb and detatched, I have a hard time connecting emotionally, I am INCREDIBLY lethargic, sleeping ALL the time, my hair has been thinning, I have been using prescription strength deoderant and I still sweat profusely, but only under my arms. I lack ambition and constantly seem to be on autopilot. I've been diagnosed with depression and ADHD, and I have been taking medicine for both. I'm on Conerta and Welbuterine, and neither have helped me at all. I did lose forty pounds, and there was a modicum of increase in my energy, and I am now down to 164 lbs, but I am still experiencing all of the symptoms stated above. I am quite frankly worried. I've had numerous blood tests, including three thyroid tests, and one time, I was told I had the hormones of a post-menopausol woman. However, numerous follow-up tests returned nothing extraordinary, and I'm left with the question, "What do I do?" I started a low-dose estrogen supplying birth control pill, because a nurse practitioner suggested it, but it has been two months and I feel no different.	6	lethargy,teenager,Depression,ADHD,hormones,hair loss,Memory loss	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_4480285	955001	Alzhiemer's? dimentia(dementia)? something else?	170	445176	May 19, 2009	My father is 72.    In the past 12 years, his history is this (in chronological order): 2 small heart attacks, diabetes, high blood pressure, colon cancer, TIA, mets to the liver, shingles.Last August he had a liver resection for the mets, and has had 9 chemo treatments as of the end of March.    After his 8th treatment he went into congestive heart failure, was treated with lasics (sp?) and was fine.    After the 9th treatment he had some trouble breathing again so we gave him more lasics, and he was fine.    About four days later he broke out in shingles.    He was prescribed Valtrex, which made him slurr his words, so we took him off that, and he was on vicodin for the pain, taking on average 1.5-3 pills daily (don't know the dosage but the prescription said 1 tablet every 4-6 hours).Then he had a brain event.    He couldn't speak.    He was making sounds, but couldn't form words.    And he started getting confused, didn't know what a pen was, and when we told him, didn't know what to do with it.    When he could speak again, he couldn't find words.    He was hallucinating or delusional or something, thought it was 1990, etc.    The first neurologist said possibly seizures, possibly a tumor in the brain.    She mentioned wernike's ephasia (sp?).    He was in the hospital for a week, and had two ct scans, a ct scan with contrast, an MRI, and an LP, after which the second neurologist said it definitely wasn't ephasia, and, further, that they could find nothing wrong.    His carotid is partially blocked, but not enough to cause the problems.So he was discharged with a possible diagnosis of TIA, or possible drug interaction (the chemo, blood pressure meds, sugar meds, etc), and was prescribed pt and/or ot for the shingles, which has left his right hand nearly useless.Then he had an episode this morning.    My mother woke up and found him gone from the house.    He'd taken the car and didn't leave a note.    She went out looking for him.    He wound up at the Cablevision store five towns away, trying to buy a car.    He eventually asked the lady behind the counter to call his wife, my mother.    That's how we found him.    He'd had a minor accident, hit a pole somewhere, so he says, and broke the mirror.    Since he's been home his words are jumbled, he gets confused.    Earlier he had taken a bath and when he came out he had put his pajama top on as pants, with his legs thru the sleeves.All of these mental problems have come about in the past month or so, which seems sudden to me.    I was wondering if anyone has had similar experience, or even a possible diagnosis.    There were NO mental problems before the shingles, no memory loss, no trouble speaking, no forgetting words, nothing.    Since then he's a mess.    Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

He, of course, knew nothing of these "conversations and situations" she thought were so real.    Additionally, when she focused on a subject she could not let it go until someone helped her make sense of it.    Often she has had angry outbursts over the past few years also, has been afraid of descending stairways, falling, and dark places.    Mother is in her late 90s now, but this has been going on for over 10 years.Recently she went to see a neurologist who took a blood test and ordered a brain scan.    THis doctor told her that her brain is shrinking and that she does not have Alzheimer's disease.    However, he prescribed Aricept for her to take.    It wasn't calming her down any, and she did not refil the prescription.    2 months later she had another bad dream and the doctor was notified.    He then prescribed exelon.My question:    If she does not have Alzheimer's disease, why would he prescribe either of these medicines for her?    If this is dimentia(dementia), aren't there other drugs out there for that or even drugs that have a claming effect?    From what I have read about excelon, I am not sure if it is compatible with her heart medication.A second question:    She also takes coumadin to thin her blood, and I have read that excelon could cause bleeding.    Could there be a drug interaction between these two drugs that may cause internal bleeding to occur?Thank you for your time.	5	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_4390048	933113	Help Please	170	882383	Apr 24, 2009	My 75 year old mother is coming to visit me for 2 days and nights.    She lives far away with her husband of 5 years and has been dianosed with alzheimers.    I have not seen her for a year, but have talked to her on the phone every week.    Sometimes she knows me and sometimes she doesn't.    Her husband is going away for a well=needed break.My question is this:What should I do to make her more comfortable?    Is having her do small tasks advisable?    Such as folding towels, helping to make dinner?    Do notes help in case she wakes up in the middle of the night =-such as "You are at your daughter's house"?Any tips you can give me will be appreciated.

I get mad at her because she keeps repeating herself, yelling for "Help" when she doesn't need it.    I know I should just ignore her repeations and try to reassure her, but I find myself thinking of how strong she was and now she is so helpless.    I am also caregiver for my 50 year old sister who is brain damaged.    Some times I get so overwhelmed.    My brother and sister live far away and my other brother , who lives in town, has suffered 3 strokes in one night and he cannot speak or walk.

post_4481892	955419	Tired of the Behavior	221	901612	May 20, 2009	My husband was supposed to go to a group session this morning because he is a opiate addict. He decided he was too tired and didn't feel like going. Later he said, "he wasn't like "them," and nothing in common with blacks and streetwalkers." I said, "How can you judge these people that you haven't even met yet?" He's prejudice and doesn't think he's an addict. He's on Subonex for opiate addiction. I told him that he was just trying to get out of going. We had an arguement.Right now I am so sick of his attitude and lack of understanding what he is doing to our life together. He blames everything on me and I am just sick of it.How can I get through this? He is 72, had a heart attack, a stroke, back surgery, 2 knee replacements and has been addicted to pain pills for the last 15 years. The Methodone that he took because of being in so much pain with his knees broke the camels back. His brain and body simply said, "Enough is enough!" So that is his story briefly stated.I have gone through so much with this man. I am just spent. I don't know how much more I can take. He has unfinished projects all over the house. Things are falling apart and he is very messy. I am so tired of waiting for him to clean up his act. Especially when he begins blaming everything on me. ...like this morning.Tell me how I can do this? I feel like our relationship has become toxic. For me its imparitive that he get through this program. I know that group therapy would benefit him. But so far, he's looking for reasons not to go.	2	behaviors,Relationships	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_4431725	943244	Can you end life support on an alert person?	221	87949	May 05, 2009	I have no clue where to ask this and I only hope someone can help point me in the right direction.My aunt has been hospitalized for a while now.    I am not sure of all the details of what she has, but I know she has not been given a timeline for death or anything like that.    She is alert, responsive, fully cognizant and if it were not for the trachiotomy she could talk.    She is able to write and communicate with everyone that way.    She will laugh, cry, etc.The doctors told my cousin (her daughter) today that since there are no nursing homes to take her (they are in New Orleans and the ones that are operable have no openings) that they would have to pick a day for the family to come in and say goodbye and they would pull the plug on her ventilator (the only life support she has).I don't see how they can just pull the plug on an alert person.    I have heard cases where people fight to pull the plug on comatose ones.    This is not the case here.    She is not ready to leave this earth.The only other option that was given was for her to go home with her daughter, but my cousin was told she would have to stay awake 24/7 to watch her and if she died while there that they would charge my cousin with negligent homicide.I am getting all of this second hand (I am in Kentucky as my husband is in the Army) but this makes absolutely no sense.We don't know where to turn with this -- do we need to talk to the Department of Human Services, an attorney, the hospital administration?Please someone help point us in the right direction.

post_4559388	974627	Dementia like symptoms?	1465	936826	Jun 13, 2009	I'm a 30 yr old, otherwise healthy male. Over the period of the last four or so    months, I've become increasingly confused, and muddled. My short term memory has become very poor, my balance feels wobbly, and I'm getting muscle twitching pretty much everywhere constantly throughout the day.Whilst I can still type, and convey myself in text, verbally I can't think of what to say half the time, especially when posed a question, and when I do say something, it frequently comes out jumbled, or in the wrong words.To date, I've seen both a psychiatrist, and a neurologist, neither of whom thought I had a mental health or a neurological problem. As I've become more and more withdrawn socially over this time, mainly due to feeling increasingly confused and muddled, when leaving my flat, I've just been told I've got some sort of anxiety disorder going on, coupled with depression.What none of the doctors I've been to see so far, seem to have taken note of, is that I've only become withdraw since I started to feel so confused all the time, and not vice versa. Because of this, I'm a bit worried something has been missed.Currently, I don't feel like I know what I'm doing half the time, and just wandering about in a daze like, drunken state, which scares the hell out of me that I've got some sort of dementia like disease?	0	None	None

post_4432154	943348	Meningioma OR Dementia?	1465	895697	May 05, 2009	Hi All,This is my first time to post in this forum, i am lost with the health case my mother is having right now, so i'm hoping to find valuable opinions hereMy Mother is aged 64 now, she has Type II Diabetis, and had a meningioma surgery (Frontal Lobe) last May2005.The tumor extracted from that surgery was big, and it caused my mothers smell, so after surgery she had no sense of smell already.. but the good part is she returned to her "normal self"     e.g. she knows what she's doing, she can control her urine, and her behaviour is back to normal - unlike before she was operated where she doesn't know or is not aware of what she is doing, very evident behavioral change, and uncontrolled urine...Before she was diagnosed with meningioma she had several months of high blood sugar level, this in fact was our first theory that the long period of high blood sugar level is causing the behavioral change since she was diabetic, but later ruled out as i said because she was diagnosed with meningioma...Now, 4 years after that surgery, we are again worried for the signs we are seeing. To give a clear distinction between the case now and before with her meningioma i have breakdown our observations as follows:1. We are seeing again evident behavioral changes... The most significant is her Cognitive abilities... She can reason out properly, but she can not find or speak the word she wants to say.    She can not complete a sentence because she can not produce the word for the object/person/event that she is referring to.        The difference now from before is that before she is totally unaware of what she's doing,    unlike now she has the sense of awareness but could not speak completely due to our observation that she can not recall the word for what she is referring to (people, object, place, event)2. She can control her urine, but poorly that sometimes she urinates in her pants,    but not TOTALLY UNCONTROLLED urination as was the case before..3. She is too silent now, she doesn't tell tales or stories anymore, similar to a total loner where you will see her sitting for hours in a corner not speaking or doing anything, just sitting, even if a person is sitting in front of her she does not communicate, just silent...    - unlike before she seems to have no control of talking to anyone with any topic that comes to her mind..4. She eats normally AND she doesn't lose or gain weight...    her weight is stable at 128 lbs... - unlike before she rapidly lost weight5. She sleeps normally - unlike before she had sleeping problems...6. She has no sense of self grooming now - same as beforeWe returned her to the Neurologist that handled her before, examined her (no CT scans done). The neurologist said she can not see any signs that the Meningioma has re-occured... Her diagnosis was my mother was having a depression, so she prescribed her to take Stablon Anti-Depressant.     But after two weeks of taking Stablon, there was no expected result happening, and worst my mother began showing unawareness of what she is saying... so we immediately stopped the Stablon and informed her neurologist, which also agreed to stop the Stablon.Tomorrow we're returning my mother to the Neurologist for further examination as requested by the neurologist herself.I am now lost on my mother's case....     Based from the observations above, is this meningioma re-occuring?     Or Early stage of Dementia?     Or another Neurological disorder?Please Help me...    What should we do to get a clear definite diagnosis...	1	None	None

My husband and I lost our first born due to the rare genetic disorder Trisomy 16q+.    He was delivered by emergency c-section at 36 weeks.    Right after he was born he was placed in the NICU.    He survived only 7 days, my husband and I both had our blood taken for further tests to see if we are carriers of this disorder.    Trisomy 16 has been one of the hardest disorders to find information on. Most of the information I have found about our situation with the q+ has resulted in stillborn or death.    Our results should be in this week, I am sitting on pins and needles waiting for answers.    If we are carriers of this disorder what is the likelyhood of being able to conceive a child without this disorder?    If we are not carriers, was this just a fluke and we can try again?    I am scared right now being so fresh in the loss, my mind has been racing with so many thoughts.    I really want to have a child but am afraid of going through another situation like this.Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.	4	trisomy,scared	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

If I sit for more than 5-10 mins, my knees feel loose and unsteady, I have to shake my knees about to jiggle them into place, then they make a popping sound. If I dont go this, and flex my knees, they crunch and pop.When I get stresssed, I get little red spots under the skin, particularly on the inside of my arms, that doesn't fade when a glass is pressed.I also have spidery purple blood vessels visible on the tops of my shoulders.The pics show the elasticity and flexibility: http://picasaweb.google.com/JonnyFear/IMAStarfish?authkey=Gv1sRgCMLc9-rT9svcrwE&feat=directlinkI am particularly worried because of the blood vessel things, I don't want vascular EDS.	1	ehlers-danlos,Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,Knee,hyperextensible	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_4616697	988741	Nasal Bone	146	955284	Jul 01, 2009	Hello. I'am 20 years old and 20 weeks pregnant. This is my first pregnancy. I am half hispanic (my mothers from Honduras) and half white. The father of my baby is black. I am worried because at my 19 week ultrasound the doctor had some concerns that the nasal bone was not as prominent as he would like to see and I was referred to a high risk OBGYN. He too had difficulty detecting this nasal bone. I was told everything else was completely normal as far as growth, heart, brain, etc... He told me he doesn't think it is Downs Syndrome but I have been driving my self insane! My quad screen was normal, I don't remember what the numbers were. I opted to have the amnio done and wont have the reslults for another week!! I was just wondering if anyone had a similar experience and what the outcome was? Is it possible for everything to be normal except this absent nasal bone and still have a child with Downs?? I appreciate your replies. Thank you.	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4579040	21	Implications of abnormal 21 karyotype	146	455484	Jun 19, 2009	46xy,inv(21)(q11.qq22.3)I hope there is someone out there who can give me some insight into what this particular karyotype means.My six-year old grandson is developmentally delayed. Assessments have placed him at the emotional level of a 3-4 year old with severely delayed gross and fine motor skills. He is currently finishing grade 1 and is able to read at a lower level, but has great difficulty with printing, drawing shapes, and coloring and is far behind his classmates in all areas. He can follow complex directions. He can also navigate well on the computer and is pretty good at understanding and playing video games, but has trouble with cooperative play and rules. His vocabulary is adequate, but he has slurred speech and can be difficult to understand. Physically, he is average height and quite slender with very poor muscle tone. He has a distinctly awkward gait and has difficulty determining spatial relations and body positioning. His facial features are slightly dysmorphic - broad forehead, wideset eyes, heavy jaw - and he has difficulty chewing and swallowing. He has frequent asthma attacks that require hospitalization. Although he is at times frustrated by his limitations (the mind is willing but the body is weak), he is a sweet, loving and thoughtful boy.He has been undergoing assessments to determine the extent and long-term implications of his disabilities. All of his biological tests came back normal except for the karyotype, which indicated an abnormality - inv(21)(q11qq22.3). I understand that and extra copy of chromosome 21 causes Downs Syndrome, but what exactly does particular notation mean?We have so many questions. Is this simply a 'delay' in development? Will he catchup, or will he reach a certain point and not progress further? What are the long-term mental and physical health implications associated with abnormalities on this chromosome (i.e., Alzheimer's, nervous disorders, cancers, or other medical problems)?His follow-up appointment to discuss these results is not scheduled until August. In the meantime, we have to deal with his teachers and the school board to determine a suitable program for him next fall. We know he should be held back, but at the same time, it would be crushing for him to see another group of children move past him in the system next year. The school will not assign a classroom aide or developmental curriculum without a clear diagnosis. We would like to have at least some interpretation of these results in order to press for the special consideration he needs to succeed at school.Any insight would be most appreciated.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4491012	957651	Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (Hereditary Colon Cancer)	146	914095	May 22, 2009	I am a 21 year old female who was diagnosed with FAP when I was 11 or 12 years old.    I had a colonoscopy done because my mother died of colon cancer.    When they performed the test, they found I had quite a few pre-cancerous and cancerous cells.    About one year after these tests were performed, my doctor decided that I should have a surgery to remove the cells.    Instead, they had to remove my whole large intestine...I had a colostomy for 2 months...I was 13 years old.    I had tests performed on my esophagous and stomach.    They found polyps in both but never did surgery.    I had bad heartburn before my surgeries and after my surgeries it was gone.    I have not been able to have these tests performed in 5 years to due insurance.    I am also starting to show other signs that I am worried about.    Such as, the inability to eat a full meal, feeling like I am full after a few bites...and I am drained all the time.    Could these be signs of cancer?...or is it just the polyps aggravating me because they are either increasing in size, or multiplying?    I really need help with this because I am really scared that I may be sick.

post_4423643	941307	excessive vomiting	146	384900	May 03, 2009	This is a particularly complicated case for me, and it all started about 15 years ago (I am 22 now). It was the beginning of summer and I just had to vomit, all day. I would awake daily at 6 or 7 am due to the severe desire to vomit, and then have that feeling througout the day, occasionally actually vomitting. I would be in bed around midnight due to the horrible desire to vomit all the time, and then would have sleepless nights or frequent wakings due to the desire.There was no dizziness, no headache, no cough, no fever, no GI discomfort, nothing else but the desire to throw up. The feeling strengthened and weakened randomly in the day, but never really went away. I had very little appetite and thirst those days as most of what i ate was regurgitated and the feeling to consume was weak. I lost a lot of weight and became very weak.This persisted for weeks. I was at the hospital 4 or 5 times, never admitted. Each time the recommendation was observation and rehydration, no diagnosis ever. Blood work, urine, stool, all normal. No other symptoms made it difficult to assess as well.We then decided to go to Germany (homeland, i live in asia) for a vacation and diagnosis. I was petrified with fear because i thought i would vomit and be sick for the 24 hour total journey. The moment I was in the cab to the airport I felt much better (this aspect will come into play later). The trip went smoothly. In germany, all was well so we didnt see the need to seek help. After 2-3 weeks however, it came back as strong as ever, exactly the same way as before. So we sought a pediatrician.This new bloodwork revealed a deficiency in magnesium (however no other signs of magnesium shortage were present, by the way, I am starting third year med school in a month, and have actively researched my condition to no avail). I was prescribed supplements and within minutes of taking one, like magic I felt as strong as an ox. Maybe a placebo effect (then again i was 7 at the time) or the real cause but i felt great.I continued to take Mg supplements for about a year, and no symptoms ever returned during this time. When we ran out of tablets, we just never restocked, and all was ok.Over the next few years, it was mostly okay, every now and then, mostly random, sometimes Christmas, Summer, Term exams, regular school days, it would return, but much much weaker in feeling. A tablet got rid of it for that day immediately.On the start of college though, it was back and fiercer than ever. After about one week of school, the following monday, I awoke to the most severe attack since I was a child. I began popping supplemements, but this time, there was no effect, may as well have been candy. This continued for about 1 month. I could not lose the feeling, and then I began taking many different supplements, but to no avail. Eventually, it tapered and vanished, but it was terrible. Could barely focus, read, study, anything.It returned the next year, right after summer, again same duration and intensity, no help from supplements. Same symptoms, gone in a month.That summer, i had a theory. Maybe it was the inaction. All summer I game, sleep long hours, eat heavy, etc., then all of a sudden back to buisness, figured it might be some metabolic shock. So that summer, i decided to walk, a lot. 7-9 hours a day in the city, every other day. When i returned for my third undergrad year, i felt great, no symptoms. Again, maybe a placebo, maybe a new cause.I did this for two years. On the end of undergrad, i was so exhausted, i decided to spend my last free/good summer as a nobody student, that i gamed again, it had been 2 years since the last attack so i was confident. Returned to first year med, this time it lasted almost 3 months. I saw a doctor, and they said it was most likely anxiety. She had another patient who only had the desire to vomit during big life changes. Moving, new school, new job, death, etc. about two weeks each time. She said to relax, and stay hydrated.At the end of 1st year, i got a full time job (been working part time till now, decided to extend hours into the summer), start of second year, perfect.This summer, we went to Kuala Lumpur to watch the Sepang Malaysian GP, a gift for my bro who just finished med school. We left straight after my family exams, from the University. Whole trip was fine. On the last day, I had a severe vomit attack AND diarrhea.It might be pertinent to mention now that every few weeks I get hypermotility diarrhea when im nervous or tense, usually just take a motilium (anti-cholinergic) and Im alright. I never vomit throughout the year (only start if school) and certainly never have both at the same time. The tension diarrhea only started in med school (yes, im quite the broken human arent I :) ).It was horrible. For 12 hours on the travel home, i popped 3 motiliums and carried an array of bags to vomit into. After I got home, a good nights sleep, and it was gone. For the past 3 days, been laid back gaming. Now the 4th day, its back and stronger than ever.Just for the record, during the flight home, today, and the attacks of the past 3 or so years, I walk arounf for 1-2 hours and feel much better, but not gone.Any ideas?It might be Mg, but why does it no longer work. Might be anxiety, but why only end of summer, why not final exams, funerals, Xmas and bad family reunions, hospital work (we are a PBL school, we go into the hospital from year 1). Why does walking help? Might be a placebo effect. Why only after dormancy...or rather mostly. Why the attack in malaysia, and the random strikes as a child.Any ideas, drugs, anything?Just on a dramatic side not, it is so severe and the feeling so bad, i actually hope for death. Wake up, throw up, want to throw up all day, wanes only. Cant read, eat, sleep, watch TV or anything. This for on average one month. It is terrible	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4372957	928846	Family Lineage question	146	876864	Apr 19, 2009	Alright, so I know for sure that I have a German, Irish, and English background. I have squinty eyes whenever I smile, and smaller eyes than other guys I know, which has lead people to believe I'm Asian. Not that being part-Asian is bad or anything I just want to know if there is another European gene trait that would cause me to have smaller eyes, or if I have some Asian blood.Useful information: My mother came from a farming family in North Dakota, and as far as I know is 100% German. My came from a logger/mill family up by the Canadian border(that's where the Irish/English came in). I have 20/20 vision, and have no other traits commonly related to Asian genetic tree. (blonde/brown hair, white skin etc.)This is just a want to know question, thanks in advanced for you help.	2	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_4414643	939192	Triple test confusion	146	890432	May 01, 2009	I did the quad test at 16.1w according to LMP, and my result came back with a 1:227 risk for Down's. The MoM values for AFP was 0.53 (17.8 ng/mL), uE3 was 0.79 ( 2.16 ng/mL), hCG was 0.82 ( 21.4 IU/mL), inhibinA was 2.26 ( 427.0 pg/mL). My age at term would be about 31 years.I repeated the triple screen at 17.4 weeks according to LMP (though U/S that day gave a GA of 18w2d), and this time my risk was calculated to be 1:8000. The MoM values for    AFP was 0.48 (27.5 ng/mL), uE3 was 4.13 (5.6 ng/mL), and hCG was 0.94 (23.2 IU/mL). Note that this was done in a different lab.I would like to add that I had also done a first trimester NT plus PAPPA blood screen, which gave me a down's risk of < 1:5000. The MoM for NT was 0.8, and the PAPPA was 1.73.Additionally my level II U/S had no markers and everything looked absolutely normal. My question is based on the way my uE3 changed between the 2 maternal serum tests, I think the risk changed significantly. Does this change in uE3 seem like what would be expected at that stage in pregnancy? How much should I worry about this first multiple marker result though it seems like a false positive?I declined the amnio but now am going back and forth wondering if that was the right decision. I am looking for someone to look at my numbers closely, and see if they seem possible for an unaffected pregnancy. Just to add, I am carrying a female fetus if that adds any more information and my racial origin is Asian.I really look forward to an answer from one of the doctors since I think I am running out of time for an amnio.Thanks!	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4735139	1017846	How do I do this??	170	637356	Aug 05, 2009	My grandpa has alzheimers and we know he has it and it is getting pretty severe. He was diagnosed in South Carolina but we are having a hard time getting a hold of his records from SC. He is now living with my mom here in Texas and she is trying to take care of him. The problem is she works long hours so she relies on me to take care of him when I get home from work. I do without any complaints, but I really need her to stand up to him and tell him things he shouldn't be doing anymore, for example driving!He insisted on driving himself to the dentist yesterday and to the doctor today. Just to make sure he makes it ok I have to play stocker and follow him to and from the dentist. I also had to call the dentist and make sure he didn't write the check for more than what we had already agreed on.Then there is the constant accusations that me, my DH, and my children are stealing from him and tearing up his stuff. Which none of this is true. He told my mom that while they had his car in the shop we went and stole parts off of his car to fix mine. #1 his is a 90 mine is a 95 #2 mine is a buick LeSabre and his is a Buick Sentre.    #3 I am not even worried about fixing my car because I am looking to get a new one.    It isn't just a little fight though he starts screaming and hollering about it and then gets my mom's blood pressure up and they get in a huge fight and then later she takes it out on me.    She is getting better about laughing with me about it but I still don't like seeing her this stressed out.    Then he says that Doug stole his weedeater, which again we always have to go borrow his mom's so this isn't true. So this weekend we went to Lowe's and bought him a new one and he put gas in it(i suspect without mixing oil into it) and now it is broke. Of course he didn't do it my oldest boy broke it is his story. He also tore apart my mom's brand new riding lawn mower and told her he saw my oldest son which is only 8 and has autism get on the lawnmower and drive it all over the yard and he ran over a piece of steal 3 or 4 times and broke it and he tore it apart to fix it.    I pay my middle son which is 7 with quarters for helping me, well my son proud that he earned two dollars in quarters went and showed him and my mom. He asked my son if he could have the quarters and in exchange he would give him two dollar bills. My son agreed and then my grandpa goes off saying he doesn't know why he has to pay that boy money for quarters he stole from him.I just don't know how to handle this man! I believe he is to far gone for us to help him and that my mom needs to put him in a home or hire someone to take care of him but my mom refuses.	11	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I am very confused som etimes, for instance taking my pants down and urinating on my chairlift instead of using it to go upstairs to the loo,putting my hand into a pan on the stove to see if the water was boiling (it was) buying things I dont want on tv and in shops, forgetting how to cook a meal, problems reading a book as I forget what I have read on the previous page, stumbling about as though I were drunk (I dont drink) confused speech, constantly wanting to sleep.    I have neither friends nor family, and have no social life as I dont drink, cannot afford the theatre, and am disabled so I cannot walk more than a few yards, so I cannot go on coach trips and holidays where I might make friends, and there are no evening classes where I live.    I get frightened when I hear noises outside at night.    I am in constant, dreadful pain from 2 hip operations and have morphine for spinal pain which affects my mobility.    I live on a state pension, and cannot afford the food I am told I MUST eat.    I have hobbies; making jewellery for a charity shop, and I used to be quite a good painter, but I forget how to do that and make dreadful messes now.    I love embroidery, but my sight is not very good now, but I manage to make birthday cards etc. for the charity shop.    I can go for weeks on end and not see a single person to talk with (I cant walk round the supermarket, so have to get my shopping delivered monthly by Tesco)    Depression has been with me all my life; I have tried to commit suicide twice.    I am reasonably intelligent, quite well-read and have worked as a Civil Servant, a credit controller, a nurse and in an accounts department; none of which I could even attempt now.    Sometimes, like today, I am quite lucid, tomorrow I may be a stumbling incoherent old fat woman whom everyone laughs at assuming drunkeness!!!!    How can I do what medics tell me???"Take plenty of exercise" they say, knowing full well that sometimes I cannot even walk to the end of my road, 10 yards away "Go out and make friends" they say     -HOW!!!!!, when most of the time I am housebound "Oh youre just being defeatist" I am told- not true,    just know what I can and cannot physically do, and "go for a nice long walk" doesnt enter into it.

post_4917755	1063300	Okinawa and disease progression	170	1055396	Sep 28, 2009	My memory has started a big fade, so I am interested in any therapies. Especially frightening are the number of short term issues that occur daily. I am undiagnosed, but intend to see my doc soon.I have started reading about Okinawa Island where no one gets Alzheimers unless they adopt a lifestyle (or diet) that is not traditional to their island. That seems proof that there is more to their lifestyle preventing Alzheimers than can occur purely from just good genes. Specifically, I am looking for information to determine if there is any benefit for me in adopting their lifestyle and diet if the disease has started?	19	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

After being hospitalized twice and getting the run around I finally got them to address the real problem ( urinary issues)    They got her in with a Urologist he told us that Mom's bladdar is basically dead and does not function like it should. It wont squeeze. Same with bowels. He said urine just sits there and collects because she is bedridden and just lays there.    The cathiter would make it come out for the most part. There is now sand/crystals or substance making blockages because of this backing up of urine.I just want to know if this is a common thing with Alzheimers patients.She has history of Type 2 diabetes as well.    Several TIA's and when the bladdar was so full and she was unable to do a BM or Pee she suffered another TIA last month.The Urologist thinks that the stroke caused this problem but it was starting before the TIA we know about. I want to know if this is a common problem for dementia people?P.s please dont feel I don't appreciate a response. It may take a while for me to get time to read and respond.

At my early days of 13 - 16 I was doing drugs heavily. I've always laughed how I've never gotten an after effect. I know I suffered from a memory loss at a young age because I blacked out most of my youth from 8 - 17. Nowadays, which is only 5 years later I can hardly remember what I did last night, what I ate at yesterday's breakfast. In the past few months I've been unemployed and I am not sure if these are common signs of depression but I lost most of my friends, and I rarely leave the house. When my wife mentions something that I forget, I always panic and try to hide it which resolves us in getting into a fight.Is there anything I can do to practice on memory loss?	6	Memory loss	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

That said this is my dilemma.In several months we are planning to spend at least the winter in another state approximately a 26 hour drive from where we currently reside. We are taking my father who is in the end stages of lung disease and requires continuous oxygen. Dad is refusing to fly. Even if he would fly I have been told that the airlines will not allow oxygen on the plane.We can not possibly take enough oxygen containers in our vehicle to last the at least 3 day drive. We could make the trip faster but he can not tolerate more than six maybe seven hours of travel a day.His oxygen supply company claims he is not a candidate for their small travel concentrators. They refuse to allow us to take the large rental one out of state which would not be feasible as we traveled anyway but would offer night time oxygen as well as oxygen upon our arrival. So than what, once we arrive at our destination we must urgently find a physician that will prescribe oxygen for him....or make a trip to ER?What am I not getting? This can't be an impossibility in this day and age. I have asked these questions of his Home Health Care Providers and his rural Physician, no one can come up with a solution.

They have labeled him as manic, skitzophrenic, bi-polar, depressed etc. He has been given meds for all these symptoms. He is showing absolutely no signs of getting better. He is 72 yrs old.Within 4 yrs he has gone from a very physical person to someone I don't know. He's difficult to talk to, he seems to be on the edge all the time and the least little thing upsets him.He has started so many projects only to discover that he can't do it. So things sit and are piling up. He wanted to put crown molding in the office (do it yourself kinda guy) only to realize that he won't be able to do it. We are taking back tools that he bought and supplies to the store for a refund.My house was a place of refuge for me. I like an orderly environment (not obsessive though), just organization. Right now we painted the office and I am sitting in the middle of it using a banquet table for my pc with plastic sheeting everywhere. It's driving me crazy. We can't put anything together because we need to hire someone to replace flooring. It's just chaotic.My question is how do you live with someone who is delusional, manic, skitzophrenic, etc, etc? The conversations around here are minimal to say the least and then when we do talk ......it's just weird.I do have to say that I'm glad that I just joined Celebrate Recovery at my church.

She has other physical problems, but the most worrying right now is she finds it unbelievably difficult to swallow anything. Her throat, esophagus, and stomach were all examined thoroughly a few months ago (when she first mentioned she found it slightly hard to swallow) -and there was nothing physically wrong there!This is getting worse and worse. It is extremely hard to get nutrition into her. Her water has to be 'thickened' and she will be able to drink a couple of spoonfuls that way, same with soup and liquidized food. Ordinary (thin) drinks she starts drowning on. She gets about 3 teaspoons of food down her, and 2-3 teaspoons water (thickened)I just wondered -could swallowing difficulty be some symptom of advanced dementia? Has anyone ever heard of that?Otherwise, there COULD be some other issue which isn't being addressed by the medical staff. Of course it is difficult to communicate with her, to ask her exactly what she is feeling.	2	Swallowing difficulty,senile dementia	None
post_4730888	1016782	Dementia treated with antipsychotic?	1465	992253	Aug 04, 2009	My father is 93 years old.    Fell and was hospitalized.    Hospital gave him Seroquel 12.5 mg, morning and night to control his agitation and supposedly reduce his delusions and paranoia.    (He also suffers from very occasional halucinations.)    When he released home, his aggressive behavior ramped up, since he is so weak he cannot get himself out of bed which angers him.    The doctor upped the Seroquel to 25 mg at night.    He's now been this medication 1 week, and the last 4 days at 25 mg at night (plus 12.5 mg during the day).    He appears to be more confused and having more hallucinations, so it doesn't appear to be working.    On top of that, I've researched this drug and see it is contraindicated for treating people with dementia.    Essentially, what we want is a drug to give him at bed time that will help keep him calm and help him sleep so he doesn't try to climb out of his hospital bed (now in the home) causing another fall.    What would be suggested for this purpose with the least possible side effects.    Also, very occasionally he becomes agitated during the day due to some bizzare thought in his head.    When this occurs, what would be suggested for an "as needed" medication.	8	None	None

A number of days ago we got the results of the amnio fluid test which have shown that the fetus has turner mosaic 45x0/46xx with 30% of abnormal cells. We insisted on doing the FISH test to confirm the result. In the FISH test only 11% of cells (172 cells were tested) were found with turner 45xo, others were normal. Since the FISH test is performed directly on the cells taken from the amnio fluid we may assume that this result is more precise than the first test that had been performed on cultured cells. It should also be noted that so far the fetus develops absolutely fine and all ultrasound tests done so far were absolutely normal with no signs of any kind of patology.We went to genetic counseling and they explained us the symptoms of Turner syndrom(syndrome)and told that with the mosaic of 11% the symptoms are expected to    be milder (taking into cosideration also that there is nothing abnormal seen on US). Nevertheless, some doctors told us not to take chances and recommeded to stop the pregnancy.It is a very hard decision to make. My question is: Can anyone tell us what is the probability that our girl will have the symptoms of turner, such as short height, infertility and other problems based on what we know so far - 11% of 45xo and absolutely normal US at 23 weeks. Are there any additional tests that can be done?Unfortunately we don't have much time, since if we decide to stop the pregnancy it must be done next week.Thank you in advance,Alex	10	Pregnancy,Turner Syndrome,mosaicism	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_4826986	1040766	New diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos	146	1024309	Sep 01, 2009	This is my first post so please forgive me (tell me where this should be posted, or just delete the post) if any of this doesn't really go here.I was recently diagnosed (1 month ago) with Ehlers-Danlos hyper-mobility type and they are in the process of seeing if I also have the vascular type due to my constant pneumothorax's and other symptoms.    I have been having chest and joint pain ever since I was 10 (Maybe younger, I have a bad memory with things like that), I'd had 2 separate "Take-Home" EKG's, once when I was 10 or 11, the next when I was 13 or 14, each time they came back saying "We don't see anything that would cause pain".    I was then referred to a chiropractor due to the fact I was always dislocating... everything, her diagnosis was "You're just very loosely put    together, we should strengthen the muscles around your joints"I tried my best but it hurt, bad, I had to quit my baseball team making up the excuse that "I don't like my coach" when in fact I was dislocating my shoulder and the pain was just getting worse, my father had become very good at "resetting" my shoulder for me, and couldn't pitch like I used to be able to, since then I had started pretending to my parents that I was getting better because I was scared they were going to find something seriously wrong with me at that point and that maybe I would grow out of it, a feeling which had stuck with me all the way up to the diagnosis of EDS, I had at that point been hiding symptoms from my doctors because of that fear (Yes, I realize its stupid but try going through what I went through).    The diagnosis of EDS was still made regardless because of the apparent physical evidence and family history, they had originally thought I had Marfan after my most recent pneumothorax.My question is:    There are certain things I have come to understand and accept, I need to know what kind of reaction I will get if I "come clean" to my geneticist and primary care physician about hiding symptoms so I wouldn't be diagnosed with something because I was scared to death of the answer. an answer that I may never had if I hadn't been taken to the hospital due to the pneumothorax.	21	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5055189	1096361	Quad Screen Blood Test - Positive for NTD/Brain Damage	146	997993	Nov 07, 2009	Due to my age (40), my doctor wanted to do an Amnio test and we elected not to because we were afraid of the miscarriage risk.    So, the doctor then offered the Quad Screen test and we agreed to do that one. I had the Quad Screen blood test done on the 27th of October at 16 weeks and just got a phone call on Nov.4th and the nurse said the test was positive for NTD/Brain Damage.    I asked what the ratio was and she said 1/25.    They have set up an appointment for me to see a specialist for an ultrasound on the 20th of this month and then we also have the big ultrasound on the 24th with my regular doctor.I know that the Quad Screen isn't as accurate as the Amnio but I'm extremely healthy and I wasn't expecting to get a reading like that (1/25).    Needless to say, I'm very concerned about it.    Has anyone had this kind of a result and what was the outcome?Also, I don't understand why the doctor would send me 3 hours away for an ultrasound and then he himself do another one 4 days later?    It seems like he should be able to detect the same things as the other doctor doesn't it?	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

While still in the hospital the pediatrician begins questioning me about the race of my child's father, asking me if he is Asian. His father is black and I'm white and Hispanic. The doctor said she had concerns that my child has downs syndrome because of his flat nose and said that his eyes slant upward. I had an amnio done while I was pregnant and it was normal. The doctor says there is a rare form of DS called mosaic downs syndrome where some chromosomes are normal while others have the extra 21st. So they took blood and now I'm waiting anxiously to get the results. The doc said he was healthy and doing everything he should be. Then I am told that he failed his hearing test in his left ear and hearing impairment is associated with DS. Regardless of the results my son is here and my family and me will love him the same.

post_5056382	1096666	Genetic Nausea?	146	964603	Nov 07, 2009	So I have been suffering with daily nausea for about a year and a half now. I am 20 and this problem started back when I was 18. I get nausea ever day any time between 2:00 and 4:00 PM. I have been tested for everything my doctors could think of. My mom had the same problem when she was my age (not she actually vomited though, and I do not (primarily becuase I dont usually vomit anyways)). It lasted for almost a decade for her, and all her doctors ever told her was that she had bulemia but then they ruled that out and just said they didnt know. I am getting to that point with my doctors and all they keep saying is that it isnt genetic. Below are a list of my symptoms:Nausea (largest symptom)Leg pain (pain behind the knee, which is agonizing)FatigueNow the medications:Currently taking Promethazine for the nausea... which helps make it so I can at least eat, but only lasts a little while.They have tried me on all of these with no success:Zoloft, Zofran, Meclizine, Tylenol with codine, Melaxopam, Ativan, Maalox, Prilocect, Pepcid, and mussle relaxersAny one with any answer or tip would be greatly apprecited.

My arm span is two inches taller than my height, but the ratio is 1:03, short of the cutoff of 1:05 for Marfan's. I have a positive wrist test, but negative thumb test. I am wondering if I have Marfan's syndrome. This past year, for unrelated issue, I was seen by doctors and a cardiologist. I had several EKGs, a 48-hour holter monitor, chest x-rays, and a stress test. They all came back basically normal. I also had an echocardiogram, which I was told was also normal. I have never had any heart problems (knock on wood), other than occasional arrythmia and fast pulse. I would like an expert to give their opinion based on all of this? Do I have Marfans? Or just some of the characteristics? Can I rest easily that my aorta and heart are fine, based on all of the tests? This is driving me nuts and I would like some info!

As i understand this chooses the embryo with the characteristics that you want and those are the ones that get implanted.I was wondering, does this means the baby can just have the same eye color of any of the parents? What happens if you want the baby to have the same eye color of one of the grandmothers..will this be possible?Also what happens if you want the baby to have an eye color that doesn't run in any of the parents families..can this be achieved? will you need an extra person with those eye characteristics and those can be included in the embryo?I guess my biggest question is the only method to choose certain characteristics is by excluding the embryos that doesn't have that or you can insert a characteristic in a certain embryo.Hope you can help me answer this, of course is just for educational purposes.

I was using the ortho evra birth control patch, and had been for about 4 years.    Well my period was due April 24th and never came, so I took a test and it was positive.    I made an OB appointment for the first of May, and they did an ultrasound and asked what the first day of my last period was (march 20). Then the doc said i most likely conceived on April 3rd.    Well i know I didnt because I was sick.    My husband and I didnt have intercourse for about a week until i was healthy again.    So I know for a fact I couldnt have conceived from April 3rd-12th.    But all my ultrasounds date me right at conceiving around that time.    Is there any way I could have had sex on April 1, or 2, then took the meds on the 3rd, and it cancelled out my birth control and the sperm was still in me from the previous day, and thats how i conceived?    Since I was wearing my birth control patch, the only thing we could think of was that the antibiotics from the doctor cancelled out my BC.    Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!Sincerely,Confused!! lol	0	conception,Pregnancy,Pregnancy test	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_4819377	1038786	Kidney failure	146	654298	Aug 29, 2009	My boyfriend and I are seriously discussing out future. A child is very important to me as is natural pregnancy. However my boyfriend suffered from a rare kidney disease as a child. He had both of his kidneys removed at the age of six and his mother was able to donate one of her kidneys. I am concerned that he and I will never be able to concieve(conceive)a child naturally if at all. I hate adding this but it is the basis of most of my fears. My boyfriend has an older brother (2 years older) who suffered from the exact same condition. Who also had both kidneys removed and had his father donate a kidney. Both of their parents are strong and healthy people my parents are strong and healthy. I wish I could post the medical name for their particular disease but I cant remember off the top of my head. I can find out tonight but I would love if someone let me know there thoughts.

Should the kids be more proactive in seeking evaluation at this stage of the game to see what lies ahead?    What are the possibilities for a prosthesis with her wrist unable to straighten out?

post_5358986	1169433	Why can't my grandmother breathe on her own?	170	1205772	Feb 09, 2010	My grandmother is 80 years old, and is in late stage Alzhiemer's Disease. Almost four weeks ago, she somehow broke the proof lock to the laundry room, and accidentaly drank around 5oz. of Pine Sol Cleaner. Poison control was immediately called, and they said to watch her closely and if she starts to vomit within the next hour, she must go to Emerg. She started vomitting within the hour. Her having late stage Alzhiemer's, she looked much like she did not know how to vomit. I had her crouched over so she wouldn't choke while vomitting. While this was happening I called 9-1-1. After about 5-7 minutes of vomitting a frothy yellow-ish type substance, she passed out. She went totally limp and was completely passed out and un-responsive. The paramedics arrived and bagged her immediately, hooked her up to the vital monitor, and she was in fact breathing, but still un-responsive to sound or painful stimuli. Upon arrival to the ER I was not able to go into the room but they started working in her immediately. The doctor informed us that she is very ill, and may not survive. Shortly after arrival she was intubated & hooked up to a breathing machine & transferred to the intensive-care unit. The doctor believed she aspirated the vomit, causing the chemical to enter her lungs. Her intubation tube was being suctioned every 2-3 hours in the ICU, with Pine Sol coming out of her lungs each time. She was on Propofol IV drip (sedation) 24/7 while intubated. Her vitals remained stable, with her oxygen stats at 98-100%, a normal BP, and Heart Rate. She was un-intubated on the 4th day in ICU. She woke-up and was 100% responsive to sound and stimuli. She was having conversations, and sitting up in a wheel chair. She was also eating full meals. This lasted for 2 days. After 2 days, her heart rate and BP started to rise, and she became very agitated, and was having a hard time breating. At this point, the doctor put her on a Bi-Pap machine, which forces air into the lungs via a mask put over the nose/mouth. This did not work well. It also caused her abdomen to become swollen and expand. After a day of this, she had to be re-intubated. Once again, put on heavy sedation and completely un-responsive. She has now been intubated ever since. Vitals remaining stable. Today, she went in for a tracheostomy surgery, because her intubation tube must come out to avoid damage to vocal cords and such. Her surgery went well and now she's back in ICU hooked-up to the breathing machine via the trache. She's being fed through a tube through the nose (which is going to also need to come out soon and put through her abdomen instead, to avoid nasal damage). A few days before her surgery while intubated she was taken off the IV Propofol drip at 8AM, and by 5PM she still hadn't woken up. IV drip sedation is short-acting and wears off in 10 minutes. She had a cat scan and did not show any brain damage upon original arrival to the hospital.I've researched this, and it seems like she didn't ingest enough Pine Sol to have all of this happen. 5oz is a very little amount, and i'm very concerned as to why she isn't waking up when taken off the IV sedation drip, and why she still isn't able to breath on her own. Right now she's on 35% oxygen, for every breath the machine takes, she takes one. Without the machine, her heart rate went up into the almost 200's, and her BP sky-rocketed. Why is this happening? Why can't she breathe on her own still? and why didn't she wake-up off the IV sedation drip? Please, can any doctor provide me with information?Thank you.	2	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Some insomnia and restless leg as well.He's a stubborn old-timer so for him to bring it to our attention is a big deal, but now he's brushing it off and wants to go see a few massage therapists to take care of his neck, because that's what he believes the cause is.

post_5274780	1149668	Early Stage Dementia	170	1175722	Jan 16, 2010	4 months ago, my mother's symptoms of forgetfulness had become so extreme that we scheduled a neurologist appointment for her. She has a family history of severe dementia (technically not Alzheimers). After running MRI's, doing memory tests and running other diagnistic procedures, her neurologist officially diagnised her with "Mild Cognitive Impairment." Her neurologist suggested that stress could be a contributing factor, but given her family history she was prescribed Aricept as a preventative measure.During the time of this diagnosis, my father (her husband of 53 years) passed away. This sent her condition into overdrive. She has only vague memories of the funeral.She lived alone for 4 weeks following my father's passing. During this time, we noted a decline in her ability to care for herself. Undoubtedly depression is a contributing factor, but even after her mourning had time to subside, she would not eat properly and began losing weight. Even more discouraging was the fact that she became unable to properly administer her own medicines due to her forgetfulness. Setting out her pills for her, getting her an alarm clock to remind her it was time to take her pills - these had only marginal success. On her own she continued to mis-dose herself - both undertaking and overtaking her medicines.We live 750 miles away, and at over the holidays we came to pick her up for a "visit". We took her home with us to a room in our home we had specially prepared for her. Surrounding her with familiar photos, pieces of art and even furniture items, we intended for her new home to be with us so that we could fastidiously watch over her care.Now, we have become the bad guys because we refuse to let her go home. She yearns for the home my father built for them, and gives no credence to her mental impairment. We've attempted to give her as much autonomy as possible while explaining that her inherited impairment requires "a little bit of help" but her reasoning skills have now fallen victim to her MCI, which we fear is progressing to a state of actual dementia. She is already exhibiting many symptoms of mild, and a few symptoms of moderate dementia. The accelleration has been rapid and alarming. Her good moments are very, very good. But in those bad moments, it's very much like trying to reason with a pre-schooler who has not yet developed reasoning skills of their own.Since the onset of this impairment was so rapid, we're questioning ourselves about holding mom here against her will. Could we be wrong? Is there any merit to my mother's tearful pleas of "let me go home, I've got to TRY to make it on my own." We fear for her safety, but moreso we fear a rapid accelleration of her condition if she returns to an empty, lonely house full of sad memories of a missing spouse.Our current dilemma is one that is more social than medical. We're hoping to strike a deal with her, and frankly we don't know if this is a good idea or not. Perhaps someone here can offer a bit of advice.Would it be of benefit for us to try to come to an agreement with her? If her neurologist, primary care physician or cardiologist confirms that she needs some assistance in day-to-day living, thus making her disease "the bad guy" instead of us, would this potentially be well received? Having never dealt with dementia patients, we have no idea whether we're over reacting or if an agreement like this would even resonate with someone in her condition.We're using repetition as one strategy, but we need her to be accepting of her new life and not continue to hold us as the adversary. Any suggestions on making my mother content with her new surroundings would be welcome.	0	dementia,early stages	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5183502	1127061	question about alzheimer	170	1141842	Dec 17, 2009	Hi, my name is Michelle. I have a question about Alzheimer's. I read that there is a new product for Alzheimer's which is based on the results from the nun-study. They say it does not fight plaques but inflammation of the brains, which is, according to the nun study the root cause of Alzheimer's.The medicine is called OCW for Alzheimer's. Does anyone has any experience with that? Did someone try this OCW medicine? The website where they sell it and the film documentations there convinced me a lot but before I buy the product I want to ask whether someone has any experience with that.Thank you so much for your response.Kind regardsMichelle	7	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5166101	1122829	End stage Remembers??	170	786134	Dec 11, 2009	Hello. My Grandfather is currently in the hospital with end stages of alzheimers and he has lost the ability to swallow and is having muscle contractions where it looks like he "wants to sit up" I haven't seen him in quite awhile and when my daughter and I went to visit him he looked up at us and reached for my daughter, and when she bent down to him, he tried to kiss her on her head. Our family has decided to let him pass on because of the inability to swallow, and a feeding tube would only prolong his suffering with this disease. I guess my question is basically this...is it possible for him to have short spurts of remembering? He would fall "out of it" then kindof look around and seem like he was "there" I asked him "are you ready to go home and get out of this hospital, I know that bed has got to be killing your back" and he said YEAH in a whisper. He hasn't eaten anything for 5 days and I was told he can't swallow, but when I gave him a little bit of water thru a straw...he held onto it for a second in his mouth, then eventually swallowed on his own. Is this common in the end stages of alzheimers where they do this sort of remembering and acting off and on??	5	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Now, he is in a wheel chair for the past year. Of course he says off the wall stuff. For the past 2 months he has been sleeping in bed most of the day and peas in the closet. He doesn't eat as much as he should. He is weak and needs help getting from the wheel chair to the bed or bathroom. It's so sad to see him go down hill like this and anyone. Does anyone really know what causes this disease and a cure or something close to it to help or prevent the disease from happening?	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_5160266	1121444	learning how to deal	170	1133978	Dec 09, 2009	I am a mother of three and married. I have had to start taking care of my mother who has this very bad disease.This has been very hard for me to do and accept because I feel my mother is to young for this.It started about 6 yrs ago after she had a major car accident. She was on her own with care givers up til 3 yrs ago and then we put her in nursing homes but that was a mistake - all they wanted to do is drug her up to sleeping all the time or call me all the time complaining. So we took her out 1 week ago and brought her home. She is doing well right now it is easy to take care of her "just like taking care of a three year old'' . I have to be with her 24/7 and just make sure she does things in the right order.Although I do wish I had more help so I could have breaks during the days. I have a sister but she ran when she found out what mom had.I am going to do this for as long as I can because she is my mom and I love her.If any one has any words for advice for me please feel free to talk to me.Is there testing or tests that I need to make she gets or has had.I feel that this was not only from the accident but it is genetic , my mom mother had it as well.My mom had a hard life when it came to men etc. and always had mental problems. I wish now I would have been more understanding and made her get more tests done etc.Thank you for listeningThis discussion is related topreventing Alzheimer's.	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5476480	1197184	The faces of dementia	221	82861	Mar 16, 2010	I'm new to dealing with dementia, so I'm wondering how many people see the same thing I'm seeing in my Mom.    She doesn't understand time anymore.    She'll nod off for a few minutes or take a nap and wake up in a panic thinking a whole day has passed with no attention or food.    Mom really believes she has been dumped in a home and ignored by the staff, even if they just left the room 5 minutes ago.    Is this problem with the passage of time common with dementia?Mom was tripping out on her lunch ticket today.    She sat there reading it aloud, and what she read was NOT what was printed on the paper.    She believes it's a note from some florist who won't deliver her flowers because she's allergic to lilies.    "See?    It says so right here!"    I'm flummoxed.    My mother has always been a huge reader and always felt the worst thing that could happen to her would to lose that ability.    It breaks my heart that she seem to be losing the one joy she had left in life.    Is it common for dementia patients to actually "see" something on paper that doesn't exist?I guess I'm trying to prepare myself for the changes that are coming faster and faster.	6	dementia	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_5445318	1189872	Does Anyone have Motorized Chair Recommendations?	221	82861	Mar 07, 2010	I am past all patience with my mother who has spent the last two days on the couch because she can't walk and refuses to use a walker.    My name is on her credit card and money is not an issue, so I'm looking for a motorized chair.    I'm certain any of her doctors will help us order one, but I'm not sure how the process works.Since Mom insists on remaining alone and independent, it's past time to make her home safer - whether she likes it or not.    I'm trying to prepare myself for the impending non-stop verbal abuse that is on the horizon.    I should be used to it by now...I'm looked at the scooter store and the hoveround.    Mom is tiny: 5 feet 2" and only 93 pounds (up from 85 a few months ago but dropping again).    There are a couple of trouble spots in the house.    I don't think the bathroom doorway will be large enough.    It doesn't accomodate her small wheelchair or walker (that she won't use anyway).    She also has an island kitchen that makes for a tight squeeze in two areas.I suspect the longer, narrower scooter could navigate these areas, but I see two drawbacks.    One, it's not as stable as the chair; two, she really needs more back support than the scooter provides.Any suggestions or recommendations?	4	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_5442472	1189205	Does anyone have this problem?	221	82861	Mar 06, 2010	My 76-year-old mother is destroying her life as well as mine and my siblings.    Her coping method with any medical problem has always been to ignore it, treat with over-the-counter meds and finally deny its very existence.    Last year she became ill enough that she was forced to face her numerous medical problems, which are:1.    Severe scoliosis and spinal stenosis.    Her right hip is several inches higher than the other.    She postponed surgery for so many years that the neurosurgeon doubts he can help her.    The discs from L1 through T5 are crushed to the point that they obscure her spinal cord on the MRI films.    As predicted, Mom is now becoming incontinent and can barely walk more than a couple steps.    Now she won't eat for fear of not making it to the bathroom, but denies the problem to medical professionals.2.    Uncontrollable stomach and duondenum bleeding.    She has hundreds of aterio-venous malformations (AVM) that require 2 units of packed cells to be transfused roughly every two weeks, more or less.3.    Self-medicating with over 20 advil a day resulted in a destroyed stomach lining, about which nothing can be done.4.    Abdominal aortic aneurysm recently discovered on a pre-op x-ray.    That and low hemoglobin right after a transfusion resulted in cancelation of the surgery.4.    Just enough dementia to result in shrieking outburst if anyone says something she disagrees with - which is just about anything.My father died in 1994 which forced both of my parents to finally prepare a will.    After his death, my mother saw an attorney and updated her papers.    She purposely left out a general power of attorney.    I was already noticing signs of dementia at that time.    The one piece of paper we need to help her has tied our hands completely.    Because Mom cons the doctors into believing her fairy story that she can live alone independently, (despite the family trying to inform them otherwise) she is human wreckage dying alone in her own filth.Mom refuses to allow us to help in meaningful ways.    She can't get in and out of the bathtub and refuses to allow any alterations to her home to improve her hygiene and mobility.    She refuses to use a walker and has fallen several times because she can't feel her feet.    She can't stand long enough to even prepare microwave foods and her diet is atrocious despite family members bringing her food.    In a nutshell, Mom cannot face the fact that she is incapable of caring for herself, and won't allow any improvements in her sitution because that would mean acknowledging how very ill she really is.Ten days ago Mom shrieked that she had to go to the hospital because she couldn't eat, walk and was incontinent.    No sooner do we see the triage nurse than she denies the problems.    She was admitted because she needed a transfusion, and could have had her back surgery had she remained in the hospital long enough.    But no.    The next day she screamed and yelled and demanded to go home.    Apparently Mom checked out AMA.The next day we discover Mom's hemoglobin down to 7.8.    She had already bled out the entire transfusion and then some.    Back to her usual out-patient place for another transfusion which took me 3 more days to set up.    In the meantime, Mom is bleeding to death.    I managed to get her cardiologist to look at the x-ray while she was getting transfused.    When he went down to talk to her, he wanted to admit her for further evaluation of the aneurysm.    BOOM!    Mom threw a fit of epic proportions.    I got my brother and sister to meet me at the hospital and we asked for a psych consult - again.    Again, the hospital refused.    This time saying Mom had to be an inpatient for several hours before calling in a shrink.    We called social services and were informed that we could not infringe on Mom's civil rights even though her irrational decisions are killing her in front of our eyes.    She suggested we report her to Adult Protective Services.I spent all afternoon last Saturday writing a 9-page report to APS.    The State moved quickly - I'll give them that much, but when the shrink showed up at her house he said her dementia wasn't bad enough to remove her rights.    That was my last attempt.    I don't know what else to do.    Mom won't allow an aide to help her.    The one time I arranged for one Mom fired her the first day.I am disabled myself, and because I don't work I am the default caregiver.    I have to fight both my mother and her numerous doctors and the medical system in general to keep her alive.    The stress is literally killing me now.    I can't sleep, grind my teeth unconsciously to the point of migraines, and now add skyrocketing blood pressure and chest pain to the mix.    I'd probably be dead by now if it weren't for my pain shrink.    Last weekend I tried to take a break from it all and told my siblings that I was unplugging my phones.    They thought it was such a good idea they did the same, leaving Mom completely alone and hysterical for two days.    I got to deal with the fallout.Has anyone else been in a situation like this and had their hands completely tied?	3	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_5397435	1178600	And it Happened Again.....	221	547368	Feb 21, 2010	My other post had to due with the difficultly in obtaining written narcotic prescriptions for my father on a timely basis. I thought it couldn't get worse...but it did.Last week the Hospice RN called my father's PCP with a request to refill his two narcotics. She called me to say they were at the front desk of the clinic and I could pick them up. So as usually I obtained the SEALED envelope and delivered it to the pharmacy unopened for refill. They all know me and my husband by first name because Hospice will only approve prescriptions for 15 days so we are there often.My husband went to pick up the narcotics that evening and there was only one RX. The pharmacy claimed that was all that was in the SEALED envelope.    So the nest morning I called the office because our Hospice RN was off for the day. The refill nurse was initially rude but said she would call back after she had "investigated" the situation. True to her word she called me and apologized for the error. She said the RX was signed and waiting for me at the front desk.So later that day I went to pick it up. You guessed it, it wasn't there. It was Friday and the office would soon be closed and my father would be out of pain medication for the weekend. I recounted my story to the receptionist and she said, "It's not here." I asked her please to check on it. After a 20 minute wait the physicians nurse appeared with a journal in her hand. The area was filled with about 15 other ppl. She was very loud and sarcastic and pointed to her opened journal and said, "You're NOT getting another prescription. They were both written on the 10th. Do you UNDERSTAND, you are not getting another one!!!"I had only 3 hours of sleep again. I had been holding my father upright so he could breath better and I was exhausted . I lost it and loudly said, "Do YOU UNDERSTAND that you have made the mistake. Don't accuse me of stealing the sh#!    Do YOU UNDERSTAND my father is dying and YOU are making the process WORSE by your incompetence!!! My father is DYING!!!"Suddenly I was whisked into the office. The doctor had left for the day. Calls were made and the wonderful pharmacist that had opened the sealed envelope verified there was only one and not two RX's in the envelope. The RN that had called me and told me they had made an error was also called and verified what had happened...but still the RX could not be found. The front desk ppl verified that I nor anyone had been there previously that day to pick up an envelope. Again they made the error. So the rude RN was now very apologetic and said, "You shouldn't have to go through this." And I said, "Than you shouldn't put me through this." I left with a written RX signed by another MD. It was a horrific experience.In about another week he will need refills of both those narcotics. I am dreading and sick at the thought! It upset me so much couldn't even discuss this till days later.I have talked to all the Hospice Staff involved in my father's care as well as local nursing staff. The treatment and difficulties I have experienced is not the norm. It seems to be just this particular physician and his staff. It's far too late for my father to change physicians, indeed he won't even consider it.Hospice will not, cannot by law pick up his prescriptions. Anyone have any suggestions?Thanks for letting me vent.A Very Tired Caregiver,~Tuck~	9	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_5206830	1132867	Pain Medication for the Terminally Ill. It Happened Again	221	547368	Dec 26, 2009	I care for my terminally ill father in my home with the help of Hospice. Getting his MD to prescribe his narcotics on time and correctly is next to impossible. I don't know if it is his nurse that continually makes these errors or drags her feet but it is very frustrating. On the 23rd the Hospice RN called his office (from my home so I heard every word) to request refills and add a new liquid form of pain medication. When I went to pick this up only the new liquid medication was ordered and none of his usual refills were ordered. This is at least the fourth time this or something very similar has happened.Nothing could be done over Christmas as no one was available. So today I had to call the on-call Hospice Nurse to try and obtain a prescription that will at least cover my father till Monday. Of course his MD was not available. The on call MD refused to order anything until the on-call RN made a personal visit to our home. The on call MD would still not order my father's oxycontin but he did order the oxycodone. So now I will have to juggle his meds to try and give him coverage for the next 48 hours. These were not early refills. Every tablet is accounted for.Care-giving is challenging as it is without adding an MD that is not willing to do his part. Has this happen to anyone else? If so how have you handled it? Any suggestions?Thank You for any and all input,Tuck	6	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_5202902	1131823	Happy Holidays	221	547368	Dec 24, 2009	I just wanted to take this moment to wish you all a very Happy Holiday.For many of us Caregivers this time will be extra challenging. I found my 81 year old stout and proud and terminally ill father in tears last night. I immediately hugged him and asked, "What's wrong?"    He responded, "I'm homesick, you just wouldn't understand. It's worse at Christmas." I did my best to comfort him.He has me and my husband of course. But gone is his wife, parents, friends and most of his siblings. I think that is what "Homesick" means to my father. A longing for the way thing were and the ppl that were in his life. How very difficult it must be for all of our elderly loved ones to feel "Homesick" at a time when many of us are so joyous.We Caregivers have even more to do in an attempt to fill those lonely hearts during this time of the year. Hang tight to those you love and care for, especially those that are "Homesick". Put a little extra love in their stockings. Cook up some old favorites. Walk down memory lane and don't forget to reach out and hug them...often.And From Emily Dickinson:Death leaves Us homesick, who behind,Except that it is goneAre ignorant of its ConcernAs if it were not born.Through all their former Places, weLike Individuals goWho something lost, the seeking forIs all that's left them, now --Have a Blessed Holiday.Peace and Love to All of You,Tuck	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

No medical professional thought he would make it till this Holiday Season.His wife and friends have passed. His children other than me are not close, either in miles or otherwise. He has a few siblings left but they all live hundreds of miles aways and are also elderly, one is even in a nursing home. All he really has is my husband and I. I see his sadness or melancholy.He's lost his appetite and nothing seems to spark his interest. He does continue to crochet but that's about it.

I have short-term memory loss, have extreme difficulty remembering names and faces and constantly loosing my keys and other items.    I have noticed I get aggitated easy and have become less socialble. I don't like to be around people anymore. Sometimes when I talk, the words in my mind do not come out of my mouth the way I am thinking of them.    My cognative abilities have decreased a lot.    Although, I do make jokes about all this to my friends and people I meet,    but I am really starting to think I have this.I have MS that runs in the family and I am also currently being evaluated for that too.For years many of my doctors believed i was just a hypochondriac, but I proved them wrong.

post_5278967	1150650	Born with no enamel on teeth	146	1177360	Jan 17, 2010	I am interested in finding out if anyone has had the same experiences as me. I was born with no enamel on my teeth. This has went as far back as the 1700s in my family. The first child is always born with no enamel (as meantioned earlier we can trace this back to are Irish roots in the 1700's. We have straight, strong teeth but we have no nerves. I was told as a child that I couldn't do anything until my adult teeth were fully grown which occurs when you around 18 years old. At that time I spend hours and hours in the dentist office capping my teeth. My son was born with this disorder so i guess it just hit home with me because I don't want him to go through all of the issues that I have faced (such as low self esteem and people thinking that you didn't take care of your teeth). Anyways, I want to know if there is a known cause for this? Where did it come from and why is it the first born always is born with no enamel and sometimes the second child, but not always. Any information or experiences would help me greatly.Thank you!!This discussion is related toborn without tooth enamel.	8	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_5285152	1152149	Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia	146	1164218	Jan 19, 2010	have a 6ft, 240 lb 15yr old with severe leg pain and weakness. We began seeing a Orthopedist when he was 3 for toe walking and inversion of the feet. Diagnosis.....tibial torsions. Into physical therapy we went with shoe inserts. As he grew he required more and more physical therapy. And is now on his 4 set of inserts. At 12 he began having horrible leg pain. He often was unable to participate in activities and we had to change plans as a result. At this time the x-rays showed flat feet and hammer toes. Leg pain was to the point of barely walking sometimes. All through this the therapist was documenting tight tendons. As a result he had bilateral heel lengthenings in 2007. He did well and was able to perform in the school musical as the lead and grew 6 inches. Then the back spasms started and the unretractable leg pain. It was so bad one day the school wanted to call an ambulance to get him. He has been on many different pain medications. And back to physical therapy again. After the 3rd appointment the therapist refused to treat him saying he needed a hamstring lengthening. Prior to this he had seen 2 different neurologist. The first saying he needed pyschological help since his EMG was normal. The other changed his medicine and again sent him to physical therapy. He usually can't make it all week at school although he walks with a cane. Stairs are impossible and forget getting on the floor. Prior to all this he was active and very helpful. He is becoming depressed because he can't even do simple things. A trip to an amusement park left him crying in pain for 2 days not to mention extremely humiliated. His twin brother is becoming frustrated because he needs to help more around the house. I might add that He had 2 MRI's a lumbar and a thoracic. I am so frustrated and my son is devastated. The doctor told him today surgery of his legs would not help him. We just returned from a 3 day stay at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, NY, 2 hours from our home. They have given him a tentative diagnosis of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia. Genetic testing is scheduled. Is there anything we can do to help him?	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Additionally, I have found different research that indicates that the same MTHFR mutation can manifest as Aspergers (or high-functioning autism).I have 2 children ... one was born with a hairy sacral patch and a sacral dimple (suspected of spina bifida and tethered cord syndrome, neither confirmed, but plenty of opposing doc opinions) and later we found the Arnold-Chiari Malformation. My older child has Asperger-like behaviors (Autism Spectrum Disorder), OCD, and Sensory Processing Dysfunction.I am curious if there has been a study of siblings to determine if MTHFR could be the missing link in causing this sort of "coincidence".Also, MTHFR mutations can cause pre-eclampsia in pregnancies.

A dear friend of mine just found out that her 2-year-old daughter has a rare chromosomal deletion, apparently she is missing the short arm of chromosome 16? She's got a severe protein allergy and receives special formula through a G-tube in her stomach....she also has speech delays as a result of this rare chromosomal problem. I was wondering what are the treatment options for this?    Do they have genetic therapy that they can perform to help her overcome this deficiency? I am asking because, while I know my friends are exploring every avenue of knowledge/treatment, I was hoping maybe I could help them come up with some more knowledge. I would appreciate any help you can offer....I know this is a very rare condition, but I'm just hoping to help them shed some light on this situation. They've been trying to come up with an answer for this ever since their baby started showing severe allergies to breastmilk at around a year of age and her growth began to stunt. They finally have this answer, but it's not really much of an answer and I know they're relieved to know but frustrated at not knowing more!!

In my small family three of us are battling a war against some kind of disorder/disease that has yet to be identified. in my profile you will see notes about myself my brother and my son. i just can't believe that all that is happening to us is coincidence. i tryly think there is some kind of link. My brother finally received a coupleof answers from his neuro- headaches he is currently experiencing are called "thunder clap" headaches and that he has venous cerebular thrombosis. he started the same way i did with fighting hypersensitivity to infections until it finally resulted in cns/neuro effects. My son is the same as am I. I had been diagnosed with ms for 13 years and now they are re-evaluating. Recent changes in my health are excessive profuse sweating that has now changed to oilly thick sweat, foul smelling liquid draining from my ears (ruled out infection) trouble swallowing and nubness in face. this on top of extreme fatique 2 years of chronic pain,    balance probllems etc etc etc. when i first met my neuro he had mentioned adrenoleukodystrophy and then never again (after telling me to watch lorenzos oil    movie.then i plug in my brother's new partial diagnosis :venous cerebral thrombosis guess what one of the causes can be? Adrenaleukodystrophy. I see my neuro on Tues and hopefully we will ALL find out what the heck we are dealing with. i don't know whether to be relieved or scared especially for my son he is only 20 years old.if any of you have this disease and can help me sort through all this i would be eternally grateful!CHEERS TO A GREAT GROUP OF PEOPLE!!!	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5454775	1192111	Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome	146	509215	Mar 10, 2010	I have a 8 yr old son who was diagnosed 1 yr ago with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. He started having seizures when he was 2 yrs old. These seizures were called febrile seizures. I have researched this disease endlessly. The problem I am having with him is his behavior. He had a test done through the school board who found that he is intellectually disabled as well. So he only learns at the age of a 3-4 yr old. Will this ever increase as he gets older or will this get worse? How do we treat his behaviors? The school he is in has done a phenomenal job with him but his violence and aggressiveness is not controlled. Now we're having to look at other means of help. But the waiting lists are so long and I have exhausted all means of help where I live. He has had control of his seizures for about 10 months now which is awesome. Now who do I turn to for help so that my son can get the best education possible.I would also like to know of all of the reasons why and how this disease is caused because it really does confuse me. My son was a normal little boy but seemed to be developmentally delayed in most areas. Especially with his speech. Now I have another little boy who seems to be presenting almost all of the same problems with delayment as my 8 yr old did. My baby has also had a seizure about a year ago. He has speech problems as well. He is going to be two next month and is very inconsistent with his speech. He is receiving help with his speech and physio therapy as well as play therapy to try to catch him up to his age level. Would a baby who has had severe bronchitis with a really high fever and cannot keep anything down from either end be susceptible to getting this type of disease? He was treated at the hospital for his sickness but was never hospitalized. I just need to know how to understand this disease completely. I am also looking to talk with anyone who deals with this disease. It feels so lonely to deal with something so rare and not have a person in the world who understands where you are coming from. Thank you in advance for your responses.	0	rare genetic disorder	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_5445905	1190027	Factor II deficiency	146	1237245	Mar 07, 2010	I have an inherited thrombophilia related to Factor II deficiency. My two sons also have MTH FR mutation (A-1 298 C) and are heterozygotes. I may also have other clotting abnormalities as I have only been tested for the factor II. Several of my family members have had DVT's and both of my parents have had PE's. My Mom apparently has Leyden factor V, while the Factor II comes from my Father's side of the family. Since I am now 49 I'd like to find a physician that has some specific knowledge of these blood clotting issues. My oncologist and a vascular surgeon I have seen have both played down the disorders due to the rarity of them, and I think a lack of knowledge about them. How can I find a Doctor who knows more about blood clotting disorders and specifically thrombophilia?

post_5361687	1170091	Homozygous gene info needed	146	1137639	Feb 10, 2010	Let me start by saying that a recent HLA-DR blood test has determined that I'm 'homozygous.    I've been in the natural healing field for years and have been researching my long term illnesses, but I don't have a clue as to how this condition might affect my situation or which, if any, of my symptoms, can be caused by such a genetic condition.I    was unknowingly exposed to toxic mold for many years in a rental apartment.    I lived there since 1979, but wasn't aware of the mold until it started to smell in 2003, at which time I began to understand all of the debilitating illnesses that had been overtaking my body for many years.As soon as I moved in I developed constant yeast infections, and within a year, I developed carpal tunnel syndrome in BOTH of my hands.    I'm right handed and was doing some repetitive motion work so thought it was caused solely by that.    Come to find out that the mold exposure could have 'triggered' sjogrens syndrome and that the carpal tunnel syndrome can be caused by it due to nerve issues that present with sjogrens.    In retrospect I can see that many of my mysterious symptoms over the years can be caused by sjogrens.I recently had an HLA-DR genetic blood test to learn if my genetics can cause me to not be able to 'detox' the mycotoxins from mold exposure.    This is one in a series of blood tests that some doctors are using to determine if mycotoxins are making a person sick.    If the body doesn't recognize mycotoxins as 'toxic', they just keep circulating and making the person sicker.    I've been getting sicker and sicker despite all of my attempts to 'detox'.    I'm a very health conscious person and have been working very hard to regain my health, but instead I just keep getting sicker.    I've moved 5 times in 2 1/2 years to try to find a rental in my area that doesn't have mold in it.    This discovery of the 'homozygous' condition may hold some answers as to why I can't recover from the toxic mold exposure.Thank you very much	0	homozygous,HLA-DR test	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5323843	1161158	"Born with a hole near your vagina"	146	1193370	Jan 30, 2010	Dear Dr,My mother now claims I was born with a hole near my vagina. Firstly she claimed I had nappy rash and the scar on my upper thigh was a nappy rash scar- responses to childhood questioning. Adult questioning has resulted in this story of me being born with a hole near my vagina. She fobbed it off as if it was nothing. Further to this she claims I was sent home with betadine to wash my nappies in. The scar on my thigh is as a result of this hole, having moved as I grew.......I have had a Doctor look at it and confirm it is NOT a nappy rash scar. It presents as "keloid like" triangular approx 1inch in size in top inner thigh 2 inches down from leg/abdomen join.II have contacted the hospital of my birth, and having had the runaround for many years- denied access to birth records because I was not the patient- my mother was- just recently found th right terminology to make the hospital listen to me and allow me access to my records to find information I was seeking. Unfortunately my birth year was 1963, and they only held records from 1966 to current date.I wish to know what kind of test or proceedure was carried out on a newborn in those days. Could I have a scar like this from a skin biopsy? - a skin punch test ...? Could there have been some kind of urogenital surgery- maybe for enlarged clitoris or fused labia, and this information just not shared with me? I feel there is a scar in my labia minora- like they are 'sewn on", and no- not a fold.I have had genetic testing, and a XX result was gleaned, subsequent to being informed I had Trisomy9 evident in two cells, then having that sidelined as a "red-herring" result.Could I in fact have a mosaic condition which has resulted in an irregularity in my genitals?

post_5310992	1158259	Can chromosome damage lead to multiple endocrine disorders?	146	1177761	Jan 26, 2010	I am wondering if I    could have had nesidioblastosis from a gene that was damaged in mybody when I was born. I have multiple endocrine diseases, neurological as well associated as complications from my endocrine problems.Seizures from epilepsy, having had to have 2 partial pancreatectomies from producing 10 times too much insulin, diabetes in both sides of my family, asthma in my mother's side, A1AD in my father's side, thyroid problems in both sides of the family. I inherited all of these problems and it becomes confusing sometimes when trying to find answers to why my body has developed the disorders and diseases it has.Can exposure to radiation be the reason why I have so many things wrong? My mother had her teeth x-rayed before she realized she was pregnant with me. Could this be the cause of the nesidioblastosis? I know that my diabetes and other health problems were from genetic inheritance from my parents genes, but I didn't develop diabetes until I was ten and suffered from a flu that destroyed most of the beta cells in my pancreas. I also have a carrier form of A1AD that complicates my breathing along with asthma...can you explain some of the genetic problems that occured to me as a fetus?Your time and input into this matter is always appreciated.Meg	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5286607	1152501	Diaphragmatic Hernia now twins HELLPPP!!!	146	499045	Jan 19, 2010	My wife and I recently lost our unborn son who had a diaphragmatic hernia. He was stillborn at 5 1/2 months normal external anatomy after a battery of tests on my wife (none genetic) the doctors said it just happened and there is no reason why we can't have a healthy child.Anyway 6 months after it happened my wife told me we were pregnant again. Last week at the ultrasound we got the news we are having twins one boy and one girl so fraternal twins. They did a    more detailed scan than last time and said they didn't see anything wrong or anything resembling the defect our son had.We decided to order the triple screen test along with the blood work the doctor ordered. Our next ultrasound is in about two weeks. Our new doctor who specializes in "high risk" said don't worry things will be fine the biggest risk is premature delivery and it is very low chance things will go bad. We have no family history of genetic problems.Questions-Is the 4 1/2 month ultrasound at all reliable in diagnosing problems? (they identified 4 chamber heart, kidneys, bladders, spines, brain....) it was a normal ultrasound minus the fact it was twins.-If the next ultrasound is okay and the triple screen test is okay does that mean we are probably gonna have healthy children?	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5267835	1147963	Down's like issues, but no Down's	146	744144	Jan 14, 2010	When I was pregnant, I had a two vessel cord. During my 20 week ultrasound, it was discovered that my daughter had complete AV canal malformation. The dr said that with those two conditions together, it was most likely that she had Down's. They did an amnio, which came back negative.Her heart defect partially healed before birth, to a partial AV Canal (or ostium primum ASD)As a newborn, she had GI problems. She had her open heart surgery in 2006 (when she was 6 months old) and her heart is now great.When she turned one year old, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and started medication. Even with the low thyroid, she was not heavy at all....she is in fact, quite small for her age (she's almost four and weighs 32 pounds)She then developed ezcema(eczema)and has chronic constipation.She had obstructive sleep apnea, which was thought to be due to enlarged tonsils/adenoids. They were removed three months ago and we are waiting for a follow up appt with the pulmonary dr.She has no facial abnormalities and no developmental delays.    In fact, she is very smart.One dr very casually mentioned on a report that she suspects my daugther may have a connective tissue disorder but did not elaborate.I am just curious to why she has several health issues that are normally related to Down's Syndrome, and they even thought that she was going to have it...but she doesn't.Are they all just coincidental?

The test was done after seeing 3 GP's, 2 hand specialists and a rheumatologist.    Almost 5 months ago I started having symptoms of pain in my right wrist, it progressed to about 1 month later having extreme pain in the night, tingling and numb fingers.    I had some swelling in my wrist up to that point.    I began using ibuprofen and tylenol to relieve the extreme pain which at that point was a 9 during the day and a 10 at nite.    I also iced it and wore a splint.    My fingers began swelling along with my hand and wrist, mostly my pinky and ring finger.    I had an MRI, which showed I had significant inflammation and was sent to the rheumatologist who tested me for HLA-B27, which was positive.    He told me the name of the disease I have is HLA-B27.    I don't understand, because it talks about the gene making you be more susceptible for other things like AS and other spondaloarthopathies, tendonitis, uveitis, etc.    I am on an anti-inflammatory medication, but the I still can't bend my pinky finger because of the swelling.    I was told I have inflammatory arthritis, is that a manifestation of the gene I have tested positive for?This discussion is related toHLA-B27.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5191616	1129074	MTHFR and bruising, birth defects, ethnicity	146	1144507	Dec 20, 2009	I was tested for MTHFR during my 4th pregnancy (new OB) because I had a prior history of 3 miscarriages.    Before my first successful pregnancy, I went to a fertility doctor (the only 23 yr old there), and was told I lacked enough progesterone to stay pregnant.    After taking progesterone supplements on each pregnancy, I carried 4 children.    It surprised me about MTHFR.    My paternal grandfather was one of 12 boys who all died from (sometimes multiple) heart attacks.    My maternal grandmother suffered from clots her whole life.    My mom (65) has heart failure, but I contributed that to a diabetes complication.    My sister (45) has had clots in her legs and lungs.    My sister (40) has congenital heart defects with her valves (which was diagnosed at 38).    Both she and I have very low blood pressure.    It is only lately, after eating enough salt to fill the Dead Sea, that my blood pressure is finally 110/80.    Before this it was normally 85/72.    If I take any Advil or Aleve, I bruise extensively.    I'm talking 20+ bruises, the size of quarters/half dollars, mostly in my legs, and thighs.    I will sometimes wake up with HUGE bruises which haven't resulted from injury.    I one time went to the Dr. with a sinus infection.    He sent me for a blood test for cancer.    I had a bruise the size of a large cantalope on my thigh.    I hadn't been injured.    Why would a condition that generally causes excessive clotting, cause me to bruise.    I can't help to think that they are related.    My OB only told me I had one type not two.    She said it didn't put me at risk for stroke etc.    I don't think she really knew a lot about it.I'm just asking, but does this run in certain ethnicities??    I know diabetes does, and since my great grandma was a full blooded Sioux, I attributed the diabetes to her.    Does this have anything to do with MTHFR??Any suggestions/advice is helpful.    Are there any birth defects related to MTHFR??    A few things that I have noticed in my 4 sons are:    One has lop ears, apraxia, loud heart murmur, a slightly concave chest, food allergies, constant diarrhea, and a prominent spine.    One has food allergies (bright red blood in stool at 2 months), prominent spine, and constant diarrhea.     One had bloody vomit, reflux, and severe food allergies (now on feeding tube formula).    My last son seems fine.    Obviously food allergies run in the family.    The two boys' prominent spines are in the lower portion of the back.    One has a hairy patch on it.    You can't tell by looking, but you can tell by feeling it.    There is a definite difference.    All seem to be normal to above average intelligence.    Of course I'm their mom and biased, but I've had comments on them, and one son (only 2 are school age) has straight A's and is being tested for gifted.    The other is on the AB honor roll.I have been cursed with a lousy pediatrician.    He actually told me, a mother of 4, that "babies spit up" when I told him that my last son vomited blood, choked on it, and turned purple and blue.    I demanded to go to a pediatric gastrolenterologist.    He yelled at me while he wrote the referral.    My son did the same on the specialist's exam table.    The specialist sent him that day for further testing, put him inpatient for further testing and finally put him on feeding tube formula.    Problem solved.    Unfortunately all the specialists require referral here, even though my insurance doesn't.    The pediatrician just tells me that it's a stomach bug when I tell them of the constant diarrhea.    I am looking for a new doctor that takes my insurance.    I know something is wrong.Again, any advice/suggestions are appreciated.	0	defects,MTHFR,bruising,Birth defects,Diabetes	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_5191058	1128924	autism/turners	146	1144369	Dec 20, 2009	I have a four year old girl with autism and my last pregnancy I had a girl with Turners.    Unfortunately, I had decided to terminate the pregnancy, (something I am still dealing with today) due to many health reasons.    My question is I am 28 and very much so want to have another baby, but am concerned with the risk of having another child with a disability.    I am interested in knowing what my risk is.Also, is there a connection between autism and Turners?	0	turner,Autism	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I have aortic valve regurgitation, tricuspid valve regurgitation and mitral valve regurgitation. I also have a dilated aortic root. Other things to note is i am 5'7", 100 lbs, very tiny wrists, very flexible, high mouth palette, nearsighted (since elementary school), migraines, and always cold.I had the marfan genetic blood test and it came back negative. We know there are other connective tissue disorders out there... marfan is the only one i have tested for. My cardiologist is at this point assuming i have a connective tissue disease and is not really further into a diagnosis as he says there are many many diseases out there. Is there any benefit to going to a genetic doctor and getting a proper diagnosis? If he is treating me like I have one already and watching for whatever it may cause cardiovascularly is that sufficient?The only thing that makes me want a diagnosis is that I have 2 daughters and wish to know the odds that I have passed on this issue to one of them.Thanks in advance!	0	connective tissue,Connective Tissue Disease,marfan,Migraines,tricuspid,mitral,aortic,aorta	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

For about a year now I have started getting frequent chest pains, palpitations, shortness of breath and sharp pains in my back that started recently. After many trips to th ER and an ecg, chest x-ray, echocardiogram and stress test I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder. A few days ago I read about something called marfans and I realized I have most of the characteristics. I have flat feet, I'm very near sighted and have to wear glasses. I'm thin and can't gain weight. My spine sticks out and curves and I have a Sternum that sticks out too. I am going to see my doctor next week but does this sound like marfans? What if he thinks Iam just a hypocondriac and dismissis it without any test. I've heard its rare and that some doctors don't really know about it. Also I have a very low exersise capacity.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I am young, only 14 years old. The topic of being pregnant and having Factor V came up in a conversation my mom and I were having a while back. My mother had said that if I ever become pregnant that I have to give myself a shot in my stomach every day. Is this true? If so, why? And, What does the shot do?My mother also has the Factor V blood disorder.I was reading an article about Factor V on the internet and something was said about miscarriages. I'm not looking to become pregnant anytime soon, I am just curious as to things I should know for the future. Are miscarriages likely to happen? Does anyone know the percentage of pregnancies that encounter a miscarriage?I wish to know more about my blood disorder, so any information would be greatly appreciated.

post_5328146	1162233	Memory	1428	1195029	Jan 31, 2010	Every place I look it is all about Altzeimers. I do not think I have early Altzeimers. I do not know. I have been hit many times in the head. The last time was about four years ago. It felt as if my brain moved. It felt as if it slooshed into the back of my skull. Since then I have been experiencing problems with my memory and retention. More than usual. And I am now starting to have problems with remembering simple words. I will try to say something like " where is their house?" and will not remember the word house.

post_5886066	1285946	Questions from concerned friends	170	193490	Jul 08, 2010	I'm wondering if anyone has any suggestions about how to handle questions from well-meaning friends and relatives,     while still trying to maintain privacy and dignity.My father, who turns 85 next month, was diagnosed with probable dementia in Feb. (suspected metabolic or vascular) at a special memory clinic. They also suspect, as we have for some time now, that he may have bipolar disorder and/or other mental health condition(s); the doctors recommended more complete neuropsychological testing as a result of the memory assessment measurements/findings, but Dad refused it. He was very angry about the findings of the cognitive testing, mad at me and mean to me because we set up (even though he agreed to the testing), and completely refutes the findings and recommendations. They also determined in Feb. through blood work that he has hypothyroidism, but he refuses to take the prescribed medicine--which also might be impacting his memory, thinking, how he's been feeling which is kind of lousy, etc.He has chosen to move to South America by himself, the country of Guyana, despite serious concerns by family and friends. He has been staying there for more than a year now, and travels back and forth every 2- 3 months. Let's just say this is a very undesirable situation (I could write a book...) Communication with him is unreliable due to cell phone challenges on his end, so friends cannot always reach him when they try calling. Plus, it can be expensive for folks to call him, depending on their landline or cell phone plan (if they can phone him at all), so they don't talk with him nearly as often as they had been when he lived in the US and apparently, not as often as they would like to talk with him.As a result, they call me to ask how he is doing, have I talked with him, what his plans are, etc. Some of the people that call are long-time friends and relatives of my father's (known him 30-75 years); one is a new "friend" (Dad keeps talking about going into business with him), someone I don't even know that he's met the past year in Guyana. (He gave him my phone number--albeit without my permission--because until this last visit, he's been staying with my husband and I when he comes back. The man's called twice and I haven't called him back.) I know the long-standing friends/family are concerned about my Dad and genuinely mean well. I have explained he has memory problems and shared a few of the    things that the doctors have said (like that he's supposed to take thyroid medication but he won't) to those he's closest with, but not the probable and suspected diagnoses. I don't think it's my place to do so and he likely would not react well if I shared these diagnoses with them.    It's just very frustrating to me, as I am already upset with many things my father is doing and am trying to keep as detached as possible, for my own mental health sake. It is difficult for me to be diplomatic all the time when people call and ask questions and I don't wish to speak for my Dad--especially to people I have no idea what he's telling. I feel it's rude not to call people back, especially those that specifically request a call back in their voice message. What I end up doing sometimes is calling him and asking him to call them back--sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. Then they call me again--haven't heard anything from him...I know my father can't help his behavior, but it feels like I'm dealing with a teenager sometimes.Do I just bite the bullet and tell those closest the probable diagnoses?No one needs to tell us caregivers that dementia is hard on us--but it's got to be hard watching your friends and family you've known all your life (like your cousin) change and feeling powerless to do anything about it. It's just hard for me to be their listening ear and support person. I don't want to talk about the situation with Dad to them. I'm sure that sounds selfish, but in the words of Lily Tomlin, "and that's the truth."Thanks for letting me vent; maybe someone can share what they've found works for them.---Yvette	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

(already taking 8 - 10 percocet 10mg.) she started me on the low dose, next month raised it to 60mg, next month raised it to 80mg. each month i was taking 4 pills 2 am 2 pm. when i got the 80mg i misunderstood the directions and took 2 am and 2 pm instead of one. the additional 80mg. had no effect on me at all. I was not tired or felt different in any way my pain relief was the same as when i was taking 2 60mg. when i told the doctor of my mistake she    was shocked i did not feel tired or have any additional pain relief, she then shocked me when she said she thought i may be suffering from early onset of alzheimer's. she said there must be problems with the transmitters in my brain, a indication of early alzheimer's. i have read everything i can get my hands on but can't find the correlation she spoke of.    there are a couple of other symptoms i have. 7 mo. ago i was in intensive care for anaphylaxis shock, my organs shutting down. a couple of days i recovered and left with no diagnosis of why it happened. i also produce alot of breast milk. does anyone know where i should go from here? or have an idea on what these strange seemingly unrelated symptoms could be.i would be grateful for anyone's help. i'm afraid and do not have anyone to speak to. i do not want to frighten my family until i have a better understanding of what is happening to me.thank you kindly	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5883872	1285429	Not alzheimers but might as well be	170	1307086	Jul 07, 2010	My 87 year old father was recently admitted to a hospital for pneumonia. Unrelated complications occured and he went through a dangerous and traumatic surgery during which his gallbladder was removed. He was in ICU for almost 3 weeks.He was released to a regular room yesterday and I noticed something funny about his cognition. He was confused and even seeing things (not big halluncinations but small things).Today he is completely disoriented and delusional. He wasn't even sure who I was. He has all these paranoid delusions that me, my brother, and my mother (who died three years ago) are trying to sue him for all his money and that he is in prison and I am responsible.In other words he went from about a pre-hospital stay baseline of 95% normal mentality to something less than 15%.I know it isn't Alzheimers (he was cleared of that diagnosis years ago, and I don't know if all these symptoms fit the Alzheimers profile).What I'd like to know from the children of Alzheimers patients, is how do you handle it? Not the interacting with the parent afflicted, but how do you handle the abject cruelty of the disease and the deep deep sorrow and pain. Although we are now waiting for some tests to see what is going on with my dad, I may find myself in the position of having a severely disoriented parent.I am already not handling it well... I couldn't stay with him longer than 30 minutes today. I can't even worry that I am over-reacting because the situation is just as upsetting as I think it is. I have spent the past 10 years taking care of my parents, the last 3 just my father. We are very close and as I said, for 87 he is pretty sharp. Was pretty sharp.As I write this I guess there is no answer. Watching a loved one lose the function of their mind is just the most awful thing ever. No way to get through that unscathed.	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5787921	1263332	Is it Too late for Aricept or something similar with rapid memory decline?	170	1345363	Jun 13, 2010	Elderly Mom on Zoloft and Risperdalby Tinkerbell920, 4 minutes agoMy mom is 93 years old and about 95 pounds. She very thin and frail and her memory has decreased rapidly in a few weeks. She suffers from depression, and is (without meds) obsessive-compulsive. Without meds she had a horrible temper and would argue about every little thing. Extremely stubborn and independent. Now she is in a nursing home after numerous falls, and never adjusted until a psychiatrist was brought in last year. She was on Effexor, and he discontinued that and started her on Risperdal 3 days ago .25mg. once a day, and Zoloft 50 mg once a day. My primary concern is her failing memory. I don't understand why Aricept wasn't started also.    2 questions:Is she too old to benefit from Aricept for memory? and I read that Risperdol can be dangerous for elderly suffering from demensia. Can her low dose of .25 mg be dangerous as she has angina, but her cardiologist who is great gave the ok to the psychiatrist's new meds. Any advice would be so appreciated. I just keep reading about all these terrible side effects and I will be doing the monitoring of any changes.

No cause found but "incidental" finding was "marked frontal lobe atrophy".    I was sixty then.    Neurologist examined and assessed me and said I had absolutely no dementia symptoms and that I was functioning at a high level and better than a lot of others of my age.    Told me to go away and fortget it.    Recently had another MRI for twitchy arms and legs and result said "cerebral atrophy".    Don't know if this is the same but expressed differently.    Still no signs of dementia but don't feel quite as sharp and getting rather apathetic about things.    This could be because I am very anxious though.    Is it possible to have brain atrophy with no symptoms and not to develop any either.    I'm probably clutching at straws here because if a neurologist can't give me a prognosis I expect it's a wait and see job!

post_5694587	1243981	Caregiving...My Father Has Gone To Heaven..	221	547368	May 18, 2010	Yesterday after the funeral service we followed the hearse to lay the shell that carried my father's soul and spirit for 81 year to rest. I earlier said that this was the hardest thing I ever did.....and indeed it has been. Dad has been so much a part of me and my life. I looked after him since 1995, saw him through a difficult and long death if his second wife and in 2003 he came to live with us.Over those almost eight years my dad's health declined and I became his Caregiver. It was a long and difficult role at times but something I am not sorry that I did. My dad lived a good life and ended his years where he wanted to be, in our home, which quickly became his home too.    The last many months were more than difficult but he never lost himself and always professed his love and gratitude for my love and care. He left me with many gifts than only a great father can leave their daughter.But this post is about Caregiving and not about my father or I. To all of you that care for loved ones, rather it's a grandparent, a parent, sibling, son or daughter, please know that in the end it is worth every moment that you sacrificed your needs over for their needs. Say the things that need to be said while you may; leave no stone unturned no matter how difficult it may seem at the time. The time will come that you will be glad you went there.There were moments that I doubted my choice to keep my dad at home...it was the greatest gift I could have given him...but again it was the hardest thing I ever did. I promise you that you will not be sorry for what you are doing. If you still have your Mom or Dad on this earth than please hug them today. Let them know how much you love them.God Bless each and everyone of you. I will be and am forever grateful for the time I had with my dad......and of course for all you support and kind words.Still....Mel's Daughter,~Tuck	7	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_5847402	1276994	What is your largest Challenge as a Caregiver?	221	547368	Jun 28, 2010	Hello Fellow Caregivers,Recent discussions have left me wondering what you see as your largest challenge. Being a 24/7 Caregiver in itself is challenging. If you had to select one thing what would it be?I know that it may be difficult to select just one thing but please try. I am leaving a selection for "other" so you may share the challenge I may have over-looked. Sometimes I think these challenges get all meshed together and it is difficult to sort them out. As I began listing the them I realized how many there can be. I know there have been days that I have had many of these feelings surface.Please share with us your choice and than please take the time to post your thoughts. We are all in this together. As a unit, with support and understanding from one another and sharing of ideas and solutions we can help each other through this, the hardest thing I have ever done.In a week or ten days I will follow this poll with how you over came some of the challenges that we face. Following that poll I'll ask you about the joys and rewards that come from Caregiving, as I know there are many of those also. So please be thinking about those things.If you are in need of a hug today as we caregivers often are, here's one from me. (((HUG)))!Looking forward to hearing from you all.    Don't forget to Laugh whenever you can. :)    It helps our soul!~Tuck"I always wanted a happy ending... Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle and end.

I don't know if it's because my hep c is causing other emotion feelings. like like the causing all these feelings I have this morning.

post_5889887	1286789	Why do my parents get mad when I ask a question about what the Doctor Said	221	1374640	Jul 09, 2010	Okay so my Dad has an accident the other day and ends up fracturing his shoulder but also had a bump on his head that warrented a CTScan which revealed an Aneurysm.    Which has really tore me up.    So they hospital sends him home (yes, that evening) and we wait and we wait... for the doctor to call to schedule appts for Dad.    So, in the meantime, I am at their house and notice Dad's feet are swelling and said to him that he should prop them up and my mom (who has always been my best buddy) says you need to quit being so bossy, he can take care of himself.    So, I bit my tongue and then after the doctor finally calls the day after the accident at 5 P.M. to tell us that he was going to schedule an appt. with the orthopedic doctor and that he felt the fracture needed to be dealt with first because the aneurysm wasn't a big deal (this doctor is my dad's cardiologist).    So, while he is telling my brother this on the phone, I ask Mom if we are going to get a second opinion considered this was coming from a cardiologist and that we should start looking for a good neurologist... wow, you would have thought I'd given myself over to the devil.... "You need to quit telling us what to do, we are handling it, you are acting like a know it all" and on, on... so I left... and it's been like that for the past 3 days.My brother lives 5 hours away and this weekend he and I and some friends were going to attend an event that I had been looking forward to for months.    At the hospital, my Mom says that I am really going to have to stay home and not go, which I said that was fine... I wasn't going to live either.    So, my brother had planned coming up yesterday and I thought well atleast he will come up this weekend... NOPE - He is going to the event and invited some of our family to go along. I guarantee that my family has told him that he doesn't need to come in, that they are fine... so why am I feeling so stressed out and overwhelmed with it all and he gets to live his life... I don't understand.	5	Ask,parent,stressed,WHY	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

We think he is a hazzard on the roads, as his reaction time is so very slow and he panics so easily.    Do you think we could speak with his doctor about this?    My concern is can the doctor even speak with me about this, without my Dad's permission?    Is there any agency to whom we should report him, although I would HATE to "turn him in" - I know it's just a matter of time before someone gets hurt.HELP	5	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_5625635	1229861	need help dealing with good and bad behavior	221	1292698	Apr 29, 2010	My wife and I have been raising out 4 yr old grand daughter since Sept 2008. She was 2 yrs old at the time. In april 2009 she was dianosed with ostrea Sarcome(Bone Cancer). We were devestated, and we were really torn with deseasons that we were having to make almost immediately. She treatement plan was to go through Chemo for 34 weeks, and have her left leg amputated in 10 weeks. My wife kept working throught all of this and I was the care taker who would spend 5 - 6 days and nights at the hospital. My wife would come at the evenings and spend the weekend threre. During all of this, I was taught to do things that the nurses were trained to do. Things that were paingful to our grand daughter. But I did them reguardless, because it was the right thing to do. Our granddaughter hated me for this. Verballly and physically. Most of the time she would tell me to leave and that I was mean. Over time it really got to me that I just wasnted to quite. But I love her and could not stop. We have been home now since January. She still continues to see me as the bad guy. Most other times she loves me and loves to play with me. Still I want to run and give up. The real problems is that my wife is the opposite. She allows her to do things that I say no too. This makes our grand daughter see me as what he says doesn't matter. Grandma will give me that. I'm mad at both Grandma and granddaughter. I've read that younger children will do things because they don't understand. That we are supposted to respond with a positive answer, and explain to them why we are doing it. But the hurt and angry that she throws at me really hurts. I feel like I've stopped my life to take care of her and she owes me. That really sounds bad, But that's how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I would do it all over again if I had to. I love her to pieces and if God or whoever could give me her issues, I would take them in a minute. she is too young to have to go through what she is going through.I'm very tired. We spend 5 days a week driving 30 minutes each way to doctors appt. Usually 1 to 2 hours at the appointment. Then 30 min back. Not to include getting her dressed and breakfest. Then I take her to school, Then I go to work and work 8 hours. There is not enough hours in a day, and not enought days in a week. I'm very tired.I'm just complaining. Looking for someone out there with simular issues, and maybe some suggestions on how I can handle life alittle betterThanks for listening.

It was not massive and the doctors thought we a few weeks of rehab he would be able to go home. They moved him to a reahab place. He has trouble with his left side but knows us all and talks to us. They had some trouble with blood pressure and heart rate but reworked his meds and that is all fine. But he completely refusses to eat at all, and won't rehab. He is very mean at times. He complains that everything taste terrible even water. He says he feels like he is going to through up, but he never has. He has lost 30 lbs in 5 weeks. We don't knwo what to do. Every 5 days or so he will have a good day and eat somthing and we are encourged then the next day nothing...We tried everything we know. Has anyone else delt with this??

post_5662928	1237498	What Can I Do to Show My Appreciation	221	612876	May 09, 2010	Hi.    I'm one of the Co-CLs over at Dysautonomia and I've been kind of struggling with issues of guilt over my relationship with my "Mr. McDreamy."    Though some of the caregiver stress of taking care of me has been lifted off of him since I got home healthcare, I guess I anticipated that the home healthcare would be this total solution to him having to take on so much caregiving responsibility and well, now that reality is here ... not exactly.    We're a young couple (early 30s) and don't really have any role models as to how to balance this whole caregiver business with a healthy relationship.Can anyone here give me some ideas of ways that I can really show how much I appreciate everything he does for me, as well as the mere fact that he "hangs in there" through all the tough times like all-nighters at the hospital and terrifying medical emergencies and what have you?    I feel so guilty sometimes that it's not "fair," and I'd like to have some perspective from other caregivers on what I can be doing to make his life better and to make our relationship better.	5	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_5667871	1238589	The Hardest Thing I've Ever Done....	221	547368	May 11, 2010	As I write this it is 6AM. Suddenly I awoke at 1:30AM knowing something was not right. I quickly checked on my father. He was in his bedroom doing his nebulizer treatment that is scheduled at 6AM. I went to his side and he was confused, thought it was five after six. He was hot and was experiencing more than usual shortness of air.I took his temp, 101.4. I quickly got his Anacin and liquid oxyfast and waited for them to kick in. He refused to lay down as if by laying in bed he was giving in or giving up. So I sat next to him and let him lean against be as I held him. After an hour it was apparent that he was not improving. I called for my husband and he took my place holding dad as I called the on call Hospice RN and turned on the coffee. Of course there is nothing that Hospice can do, nothing anyone can do at this moment as I am following dad's wishes.I now have him propped on his side with pillows, the head of his bed is elevated. Between my husband and I we are at his side. I have taken a break as the tears have come, uninvited and roll down my checks. They just won't seem to stop.Daylight has come. I don't know what lies ahead for dad. It has been raining since I awoke at 1:30. It's as if the heavens are crying with me.I hope I have covered everything and I hope I am making the right choices. I once again asked dad if he wanted to go to the hospital. They may be able to slow this process or who knows maybe even reverse it for a short time. But dad has made his wishes clear on numerous times before this day and repeated them again to me this morning, "I want to stay here." ...and than he added, "If it's not to much trouble for you."    My Lord how could my dad be any trouble? And I assured him he was not.    And I told him for the millionth time, I love you.I will not be on MedHelp much today.

post_5508177	1204573	My Caregiver Days are Over	221	82861	Mar 26, 2010	Mom passed away this morning at 4:00 am - on her 77th birthday.    She was getting nothing but worse by the hour at Vosswood Nursing Center, and I blame them for many things that made the last days of her life miserable.    Even after a stern family meeting and ragging on them daily, they didn't act.    No regular hemoglobin checks, no visit from their doctor, and pressure sores all over her feet and tailbone after not even two weeks under their tender mercies.Had we not called an ambulance to take Mom to the hospital yesterday, none of us would have had a chance to say goodbye.    The paramedics reamed out the nurses wanting to know when the last time was "ANY of you saw her NORMAL!"    They couldn't answer because they haven't been checking on her.    Mom was bleeding to death and they kept insisting her hemoglobin had gone UP.    No way.    The wouldn't retest until the got new orders and naturally wouldn't call to get them.I am so angry right now I can hardly contain myself.

post_5775087	1260497	Is dementia inevitable	1465	1338685	Jun 09, 2010	Three years ago I had an MRI scan for persistent headache.    No cause found but "incidental" finding was "marked frontal lobe atrophy".    I was sixty then.    Neurologist examined and assessed me and said I had absolutely no dementia symptoms and that I was functioning at a high level and better than a lot of others of my age.    Told me to go away and forget it.    Recently had another MRI for twitchy arms and legs and result said "cerebral atrophy".    Don't know if this is the same but expressed differently.    Still no signs of dementia but don't feel quite as sharp and getting rather apathetic about things.    This could be because I am very anxious though.    Is it possible to have brain atrophy with no symptoms and not to develop any either.    I'm probably clutching at straws here because if a neurologist can't give me a prognosis I expect it's a wait and see job!	2	None	None

post_5854482	4	unbalanced translocation q4 (35.2) q11(22.3)	146	1364821	Jun 30, 2010	Hi My lovely daughter was born by IVF (icsi with assisted hatching) and has unfortunately inhereted an unbalanced translocation between chromo 4 (missing from 35.2 tiny amount) but has additional chromo 11 from 22.3. Her dad is the balanced carrier of the same and we did not know prior to pregnancy (despite all the usual & advanced tests) that he had this. Lucy is now 11 months old and has low tone (trunk) and some gross motor development delay although is very bright, alert, verbal & plays with toys. She cannot sit, roll, crawl etc and has had silent reflux scince birth.She has to undergo three operations (general anestetic) later this year to fix a dislocated hip (was born breech). Does anyone know if she is at more risk of developing brain damage as a result or should she be at no more risk than ususal? Lucy also had unexplained ecoli septiceamia at 5 1/2 months but with medical help recovered fully.I would welcome any help as her particular chromosome make up is so rare.

post_5517432	1206720	Ehlers Danlos	146	1262341	Mar 29, 2010	I am a 50 year old female and have been dealing with chronic pain and weird symptoms all my life.    As a child I suffered from chronic tonsil infections.    I used to avoid the sun because I would overheat because I did not sweat. I was always very flexible and everyone used to comment on how soft my skin was.    By the time I was 15 I started experiencing irregular and painful menstrual cyles as well as anemia and migraines.    My blood pressure has always been on the low side.     By the time I hit my early 20's I started having trouble with my intestines.    At 23 I went to the hospital with severe abdominal pain.    My bowels were leaking and were ready to rupture so they performed emergency surgery.    This was 3 weeks before my wedding and I had developed a severe infection in the wound which they were considering packing and leaving open. After aggressive antibiotic treatment the wound started to slowly heal.    Through my life I have had a number of surgeries including colon cancer.    Each time another infection followed.    Every year my symptoms seem to be getting worse, widespread joint and muscle pain, trouble with finding a vein and veins blowing when given an IV or drawing blood,    bruising every time I get a needle,    TMJ, degenerative disc disease, chest pain, edema, weakness in arms and legs etc.    A couple of years ago I was referred to a Neurologist because I had 2 bad migraine attacks that affected my left eye. These were not the first severe migraines I have suffered from or the last.    During his examination he did discover that I had loose ligaments.    I was sent for an MRI, the brain scan showed small vessel disease, increased white matter and some slightly prominent vessels that in their opinion (the unlikely possibility of a small vascular malformation or dural fistula).    Which they told me not to worry about.    I recently had a conversation with my sister and she had mentioned that our scars are not normal.    She works in the medical field and had showed a hematologist she worked with her scars and she was told they were cigarette paper scars and it could be    Ehlers Danlos.     My sister also has problems with joint dislocation.     All my scars look like cigarette paper scars and seem to widen the older they get.    Other abnormalities, flat feet, born with no wisdom teeth, B12 deficiency, lazy eye, trouble with vision and sensitivity to light, shortness of breath, numbness and pins & needles, muscle twitching and spasms,    burning in my calves etc.    Some days I feel like I am going to end up in a wheelchair.    There are also other siblings in my family who suffer from some similar symptoms.    They diagnosed me with fibromyalgia.     Could this be Ehlers Danlos?	4	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I have had two MRI's and seen three neurologists.    My large muscles, mostly my arms and legs are weak and feel "squeezed" at times.    The pain can be unbearable at times.    I currently take 1200mg of neurontin, 800 mg CoQ 10, 15 mg, meloxicam daily.    I also have a cream used topically for the needle like pain I get in my toes.    The weakness seems to have been stable for the past 6 months.    The pain has been off the charts for about two weeks.    I have recently been having some breathing issues and have a chroninc or irritative cough since 9/2009.    I do have arthritus in my spine.    EMG's are normal.    MRI's show white matter damage, but supposedly doesn't look like MS.Do you know of a condition that may be causing this?	2	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5834843	1274013	Results from Microarray test	146	1358894	Jun 24, 2010	HiI am hoping to find some answers because the report that we have just recieved from the geneticist is not clear.    My daughter is 10, and has had developmental problems since birth (she is adopted but we know her medical history).    She has been diagnosed with autism and has moderate learning disabilites, however both her pediatrician and geneticist felt that due to her dysmorphic features she had some kind of a genetic condition.    Her results are as follows:Chromosome 5 Gain of 18.69kb arr 5q35.2(175,511,640 - 175,530,330)x3Chromosome 8 Gain of 99.46kb arr 8p23.3(16,970 - 116,430)x3Chromosome 14 Gain of 502.03kb arr 14q.11.1q11.2(18,857,900 - 19,359,930)x3Chromosome 18 Loss of 135.83kb arr 18p11.32(1,900,540 - 2,036,369)x1Chromosome 10 loss of 4.08kb arr 10p12.1(25,304,960 - 25,309,040)x1This was all the information we have been given, but can't decipher what exactly is going on with her.    We feel that she must have some sort of syndrome as her MRI and EEG both showed normal brain function and structure.    Can anyone decipher these numbers and tell me in real terms what they mean?Thank you in advance!	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5598279	1224375	thanatophoric dwarfism...please help	146	1175451	Apr 21, 2010	thanatophoric dwarfism is a lethal form of dwarfism that leads to the babes death minutes after birth from suffocation.I just went to see my OB and I have to go tuesday to the high risk fetal dev. clinic in London ON for a detailed US. My GP that I saw monday only told me that the report said "highly suspicious of thanatophoric dwarfism". My OB today read it to me and here is what it says:~head circ. normal~BPD normal~abdominal circ. normal~spine normal~nose and lips normal~no frontal bossing~femoral length 1.5 cm (4 weeks behind) also states that these are +/- 2 weeks~humerus 1.5 cm (3 weeks behind) also states that these are +/- 2 weeks~hypoplastic ribs~appears to be bell shaped thoraxmy OB also said that the clinic I had the US done at has been known to make mistakes in the past (we went there only beacuse it's the only clinic that will tell you the sex and we didn't know about the reputation). She also said that after they do the report they throw away all pics which is so not right. She basically said to relax, that it could be errenous. My husband is 5'10 (but has short legs) so my OB said he might just have short legs and they still could catch up a bit. Do you know how far growth needs to be behind for them to say without a doubt that there's a problem? do you think that maybe his short ribs may not indicate a real problem? Im just trying to figure out the chances that maybe things will be okay...My OB said to still have hope that my babe may still be okay...so scared for my little man and I know I can't do much but wait.normally, thanatophoric dwarfism is indicated by shortned limbs that are curved, shortned ribs, clover leaf skull, narrow rib cage, hydrocephly, flat spine etc....my babe has a couple of those (apparantly) but not all...what are the chances that maybe the first US is wrong??	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

This was discovered after investigations into her global developmental delay. She also has lymphangioma in her eye socket which at this stage is assumed to be unrelated, but who knows. I'm unable to contact the paediatrician at the moment but I have some questions I'd like answered if possible. First of all, I'm a little confused as to why a 'y' chromosome is affected - don't girls only have 'x' chromosomes?? Also, is this likely to affect her menstrual cycle and/or the likeyhood of becoming pregnant when she's older?

I may be her aunt (my brother's daughter).    My brother does not wish to provide a blood sample, so she & I did.     The company that we used stated that the probability of the 2 of us being related is 24.24%.    She & I share one or two alleles for:    TH01 (6), D18S51 (16), Penta E (13), D13S317 (8), D7S820 (8), CSF1PO (11), Penta D (12), vWA (16), TPOX (8 AND 11).    Now, call me an optimist, but I would think that 24.24% is pretty high & the liklihood of two unrelated people sharing these alleles pretty low.    However, I don't know a thing about genetics & I have no clue as to how common these particular alleles may be.    What are your thoughts?    I asked her mother last nite if she'd be willing to provide a blood sample, although I'm concerned that this may be a waste of time.

My research showed that for some inexplicable reason RT carriers do not respond well to HCG used as part of IVF and I was told to try naturally which we did and finally we have a healthy daughter. I am now 39 and want another child only now my husbands sperm has been tested and is pretty useless on all fronts. Low sperm cound, low motility and abnormal in shape. After a year of trying naturally I dont think his sperm is capable of much. So I figured IUI was as close as we could get to trying naturally. I am tempted to do a stimulated IUI so I have more eggsin the mix but am concerned that the HCG I would take will affect the quality of my eggs. Can HCG affect egg quality? Should I just be naturally ovulating, producing 1 egg and doing IUI instead of stimulating?	1	robertsonian translocation,robertsonim translocation	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5714830	1247993	Sequential Screen and False Negatives?	146	1323551	May 23, 2010	Hello WomynI have had my sequential screen results returned to me...my Down's risk was 1:7,000, T18 risk 1:10,000, NTD risk 1:1,500.    The baby had an echogenic focus in the heart (EIF) at the 20 week scan, but I was assured this means nothing considering my numbers, which both the doctor and the tech said were "great".My question for you all is:     How seriously can I take these numbers?    I know the sequential, or integrated, screen has a 92% accuracy rate.    Which I assume means that 8% of women who get good numbers in fact have a baby with Down's or another problem.    How can I tell if I might be in that 8%?    Would my numbers be a lot worse (I am 30 and was told these are excellent numbers to see on the test)?    Maybe the 8% are closer to the 1:500 range; that is, closer to the cutoff for an amnio.    Or is it a total shot in the dark?    Can somebody with a 1:7,000 risk, as assessed by the screening, have a child with Down's?I am nervous about this, because of the EIF, but also because I always seem to fall into the small percentage category (like, my blood type is not only negative, but also the rarest type on the planet).    Since my numbers were so "great", I'm not being offered a meeting with the genetic counselor, let alone an amnio (which I don't really want anyway).    Please, somebody let me know what the deal is with this.thanks a million,Taffy	2	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5639221	1232689	Will lovenox and coumadin help dissolve blood clots?	146	1301232	May 03, 2010	A ct scan with an IV contrast (3/15/10) found I had multiple blood clots in the portal vein. Further tests showed the cause to be a hereditary blood disorder called gene 5 mutation. It is pretty complicated to fully understand. The ct scan showed (fortunately) no cirrhosis or other damage to the liver. I have been to two hematologists and the dr I am crrently seeing has me on 2 injections of 60 mg lovenox and 5mg of coumadin daily. I am to get my blood tested today, my pt/inr #'s have been low (1.1-1.2). Dr said it should be between 2-3. I am scared and am consumed with confusion about all this. It is very hard for me to watch my intake of vitamin K veggies and alcohol. I am a 50 yr old woman in otherwise good shape and condition. But I do (or did) drink alcohol on a daily basis as well as ate all the veggies not allowed daily. I was told no alcohol or veggies w/vitamin K. This is a VERY big change to my daily lifestyle and would like anyone else's suggestions who may be going thru the same or know another who is.

Our little baby girl was stillborn on the 03 Feb. She also had severe hydrocephalus.     She survived up until about 10 minutes before she was born.I was just wondering what are the chances of this happening us again if we ever decide to get pregnant again. There is no spina bifida in either of our families, so would you suggest for us to get genetic counselling.    Also i took the recommended amount of folic acid before and during the pregnancy.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,
post_5506622	13	FISH results, amnio results, Trisomy 13	146	1258697	Mar 25, 2010	Hi, new to posting at this site. I have been reading and reading and Ive found alot of good and useful information. I was hoping to find answers about what I am going through right now. I am pregnant with my 4th, he was a surprise. I have 3 normal, healthy children with the last being born 7 years ago. My family and my husbands family do not have any history of any trisomies or any other genetic disorder. My mom, aunts and grandma all had children in their mid to late 30s. I am 38. Not only was this pregnancy a surprise, but how different I get treated now because of my age has been quite the adjustment too. When I was 31 I didnt have to deal with the high risk talk and the advanced maternal age talk and everything I have been associated with because of my age with this pregnancy.Now for the yucky, confusing, not so fun stuff that Im trying to figure out and find people who can relate. I had the blood test that checks for the risk of Downs and Neural Tube defects, etc. The result of that was "a mild, very mild risk for Downs". Thats how the nurse worded it. From there I was told I could go to a bigger city for my next ultrasound where they specialized in high risk pregnancies. Since I wasnt wanting to do an amnio, I thought this would be a nice compromise. I was scheduled for the Level 2 ultrasound 3 weeks from the day I spoke with the nurse about my blood test results. On the day of ultrasound, hubby and I drove to the bigger city where we did not know anyone and nobody knew us. We did the normal things with the nurse and then waited for the Tech to get us for the ultrasound. She came and the Perinatologist joined us for about 3 minutes and then he left to go do a C-section. He was the whole reason we went up there, but whatever. We were doing the ultrasound and about 5 minutes into it, the tech got silent and had a weird look on her face. Not what I was hoping for. Of course she cant tell us anything and the doctor wasnt in there, so we just suffered in silence. I had shown my hubby things to watch for associated with Downs since thats what the blood test had said there was a risk for. She turned the monitor away from me when she got silent but hubby could still see it and he could see what she was looking at, what she was typing, etc. When she was done, she put us in another room to wait for the doctor to return. It was the longest wait ever. In the room, hubby said she had written club foot and banana sign. Everything looked as it should to him except for the foot. The doctor came in and said right off the bat the tech saw a club foot. He gave us a sheet with the markers of the trisomies and showed us that club foot was a marker for T13 and T18. He says we are going back in so that he can see the ultrasound being done. She shows him the foot, he agrees with club foot. She shows him the banana sign, and he asks for the measurement, he says its within normal limits. She shows him the nose and he doesnt see anything wrong with it. She shows him the eyes, again nothing wrong. He asks to see the hands, they are open and look fine. The heart looks fine. Basically, the only thing that wasnt fine was the one club foot. He says the only way to know 100% is to do an amnio. He says he can do it right now. So we do it. He calls a couple days later with the FISH results. It has 3 in the Trisomy 13 spot. He gives us the gloom talk and tells us to wait for the final results of the amnio which should come tomorrow. He says most likely they match up and we shouldnt expect anything different.Im trying to get answers for my specific situation........one marker only (one club foot) appearing during the ultrasound, FISH results positive for T13...........should I full expect the amnio final results to be concurrent with the FISH??

The symptoms of this diseas are: short legs and stocky torso and ankles have a small absence of motion. The daugter is also quite heavy if to consider that she is only a child. And it is difficult for her to do sports like skiing and running.    They haven't got any help from estonian doctors and this disease is also the reason why they can't have a child.

All other levels were fine, and US did not show any abnormal developments.After consultation with a geneticist I had an amnio done, results still outstanding. The amnio will look for indications of SLO Syndrome as well as x-linked ichthyosis. The geneticist suspects x-linked ichthyosis to cause the low levels, due to a skin condition of mine, as well as my fathers. However, after finding out more about XLI, I do not believe I or my father have XLI, but sebhorreic eczema instead.Now my question is wether:1) the amnio can confirm steroid sulfatase deficiency (linked to XLI) and2) whether there are any other know conditions linked to steroid sulfatase deficiency (such as sebhorreic eczema)I found only one study suggesting this.Thank you for expertise!	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6258940	1371400	Alzheimer√¢¬Ä¬ôs Disease: Specific Warning Signs	170	1478333	Oct 17, 2010	The Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association has developed a checklist of common symptoms to help family members recognize the difference between normal age-related memory changes and possible warning signs of Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease.Ten Warning Signs of Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs1. Memory loss. Forgetting recently learned information is one of the most common early signs of dementia. A person begins to forget more often and is unable to recall the information later. He or she forgets to attend medical appointments, for example2.3. Difficulty performing familiar tasks. People with dementia often find it hard to plan or complete everyday tasks. Individuals may lose track of the steps involved with preparing a meal, placing a telephone call, or playing a game.4.5. Problem with language. People with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease often forget simple words or substitute unusual words, making their speech or handwriting hard to understand. They may be unable to find the toothbrush, for example, and instead ask for √¢ Ä úthat thing for my mouth.√¢ Ä ù6.7. Disorientation to time and place. People with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease can become lost in their own neighborhood, forget where they are and how they go there, and may not know how to get back home8.9. Poor or decreased judgment. Those with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs may dress inappropriately for weather, wearing several layers on a warm day or little clothing in the cold. They may show poor judgment, like giving away large sums of money of strangers10.11. Problems with abstract thinking. Someone with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease may have unusual difficulty performing complex mental tasks, like forgetting what numbers are for and how they should be used.12.13. Misplacing things. A person with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease may put things in unusual places: for example, an iron in the freezer or a wristwatch in the sugar bowls.14.15. Changes in mood or behavior. Someone with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease may show rapid mood swings-from calm to tears to anger-for no apparent reason.16.17. Changes in personality. The personalities of people with dementia can change dramatically. They may become extremely confused, suspicious, fearful,, or dependent on a family member.18.19. Loss of initiative. A person with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease may become very passive, sitting in front of the TV for hours, sleeping more than usual, or not wanting to partake in normal activities.It is important to note that many treatable health conditions have the same signs as dementia and Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease. The earlier you detect and discuss your observations with your elders, the better. Seeking help early can save families heartache and money	5	alzheimer's,Alzheimer's disease,dementia,dementia; alzheimer	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_6254507	1370381	Alzheimers or age	170	1175671	Oct 16, 2010	I am a 46 year old male that has been experiencing some memory problems. Most people I know have memory problems so the question is what's normal. I can remember verbatim the last 30 to 50 words spoken on a television show or my locker combination from elementary school. But I can't remember where I set stuff down. I forget that I turned the tea kettle on or put a bag of popcorn in the microwave. I do remember it hits me, when I look for my tea. I talk with friends who share some difficulties but it is scaring me.I have an uncle who has alzheimers and a neighbor who was in her forties when it struck her. I used to pride myself in the fact that I could remember everything from my license number to credit card numbers. I can still play simon online. But I am not sure if that's a different type of memory.I realize that anyone can get it but for two unrelated people that live across the street from each other to get it at such an early age would be really something.	4	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I also know Aricept is designed to slow down the dementia so if I discontinue it I'm wondering if he will become worse much faster.

post_6258936	1371399	Earlier Detection of Alzheimer Disease Revealed	170	1478333	Oct 17, 2010	For the first time in at least a generation, medical experts have new criteria, a major change in the analytical guidelines for Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs. The orders, which are expected to be adopted this fall to detect Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs, would allow technology, such as brain scans, to be used to detect the disease as it is rising √¢ Ä ì even before clear memory problems or other warning signs appear.Experts predict a major increase √¢ Ä ì perhaps a threefold jump √¢ Ä ì in the number of people with Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease as a result of the guidelines, according to a report in The New York Times. Around 5.3 million people now are diagnosed with the disease, the Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association says. The new guidelines reflect the belief that the disease is at hand, years before dementia symptoms appear. They include criteria for three stages of the disease: preclinical disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease and, lastly, Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs dementia.Experts presented the guidelines at the Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association International Conference on Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs disease in Honolulu. A board of experts gathered by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer√¢ Ä ôs Association met to develop the new approach.	2	Alzheimers Disease,alzheimer,detection,disease,dementia,alzheimer's,dementia; alzheimer,Alzheimer's disease,Seniors,Senior Health,Senior Care,alzheimer's facility	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Every time I start to get my life back something else throws me in a downward spiral. I spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about my future instead of living it. To keep it short. I found out that I have a problem with my cervical spine which is causing headaches and neck pain. This was getting me very depressedI started noticing that I was forgetting too many things. This of course made me think I had yet another problem.I started worrying about Alzheimer's. My wife gave me a list of twenty things to memorize in a minute and even though I can remember all twenty weeks later, I still dwell on the fact that I forget too many things. Things like what I went to the store for. Did I pay that bill. The dogs worm pill. To tell a coworker something important.I know that at 46 I am not going to be quite as sharp as I once was, but I feel like I am falling apart.Someone told me that if you can stand on one leg in the dark for ten seconds that it's a good sign. I don't know how that relates to AL but I can stand for a minute or so.People say that age affects memory. Which memory, I can remember lock combination's from elementary school.

She is 53 years old and alzheimer's runs in her family. She is currently on two types of medication that don't seem to be helping but do seem to be making her severely depressed. We just got a copy of her MRI and I just want someone that can summarize it for us in layman's terms.Findings: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed with sagittal and coronal T1-weighted images, diffusion weighted axial images, gradient echo acial images, FLAIR axial images and fast spin-echo T2-weighted axial images on a 1.5 Yesla MR unit.There is a punctate hyperintensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted images in the right posterior frontal corona radiata white matter, and several additional punctate hyperintensities in the left parietal subcortical white matter. The ventricles and cortical sulci maybe mildly prominent for the patien'ts age. There is no evidence of hemorrhage, mass-effect or extra-axial collection.Flow-voids are identified in the interal carotid and basialar arteries consistent with their patency.There is mild mucosal thickening in the bilateral maxillary and left ethmoid sinuses and mild to moderate inflammatory signal abnormailty and bilateral inferir mastoid air cells. The visualized portions of the remaining paranasal sinuses, mastoid air cells, nasopharynx and orbits are unremarkable.Impression" Mild ventricular and sulcal prominence for age which could be within the range of normal limits, or could be due to mild cerebal atrophy. Several supratentorial white matter hyperintensities are present, which is a nonspecific finding that may be due to multiple etiologies including small vessel ischemic demyelinaation, demyelinating disease, migraine headaches, Lyme diesease, viral disease and vasculitis.	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_6261652	1372013	Is he dying?? - Please Answer	170	1472088	Oct 18, 2010	Two weeks ago, my grandfather seemed to be following his "normal" route of progressing alzheimer's. Some days were better than others. All of sudden, his blood pressure dropped, his kidney's starting failing, he's defecating and urinating on himself more than normal, he can't speak (he only cries and mumbles words), and now he chokes on and vomits any food the hospital tries to give him. My grandmother signed a DNR and living will, so feeding tubes are out. They gave him so fluids and his kidneys are doing a little better, but thats about it. In your honest opinion, is this the end?

post_6257817	1371163	PLEASE HELP- How long does he have???	170	1472088	Oct 17, 2010	My Grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimers about 8 years ago. Medication has helped slow the progression, but I feel as though this is it. He is completely bedridden (well in his recliner, he can't sleep laying in the bed). He is unable to walk at all, he refuses to eat all together besides a piece of toast once in a while, he is incontinent with both urine and stool, he doesn't recognize a lot of his family, and he sleeps all day long. If he's not sleeping, he's crying. Even though he is completely immobile, he sometimes forgets and will drag himself out of the chair, and fall, often hitting his head or getting stuck on the floor, where he then either urinates or defecates. Two days ago he fell out of his chair, and now it's like there's nothing there, even though there was no major damage. He doesn't understand anything and is completely unaware of his surroundings. He's still refusing to eat, has zero bodily excretion control, and cries to communicate. He's obviously stage 7, but do you think this is the end?	1	alzheimer's,dementia,end of life,stage 7	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

She only speaks on occassion.    She is eating- but with her fingers.    She is still home with my Dad.    I don't think he wants to place her- but I am not sure how much longer he can keep it up.    We do have a nurse but still- it is on him much of the time.    I live in another state but go home as much as I can. I don't know what my question is! I know things just get worse and worse.    It is my Dad's call and we totlly support him.    If he wants Mom at home I want to do all I can to help.

post_6127540	1340973	Concussion	170	1287446	Sep 10, 2010	Hi everyone,I have a question, as I'm a little concerned. I was attacked in a parking lot from behind about 5 hours ago, and sustained a concussion from the incident. I have no lasting effects to my knowledge from the incident, other than obvious sensitivity to that area of my head in which it occurred. Sometimes the scar appears a bit sore as well.An MRI done in April of this year (it was just a routine follow up) showed brain scarring. My neurologist asked me if I ever had any major head injuries, and I explained to him what happened. He said it must have been one major blow to show up on an MRI, and he said there might have also been bleeding on the brain when it occurred. Everything is apparently fine now, and he stated it apparently happened to a part of the brain that doesn't involve talking, memory, etc.My question is this: am I going to be more prone to something like alzheimer's or something of that sort because of this? My dad is suffering from that right now, at an early age (67), but he's had numerous other health issues, including stroke, heart attack, etc. I'm a health nut, and in shape - but just worry about what this might cause. Otherwise, I guess you could say I'm lucky in that it wasn't even worse.	0	alzheimer's,concussion,Head Injury	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

The surgery was done on August 3, 2010, and I have 2 big floaters swirling directly in the vision of my sight, along with 100 or so very small spects.    They don't seem to be getting smaller or dropping down out of sight. They are the same size they were after the surgery and the head doctor has confirmed that they are pieces of the cataract that were not removed. I have never had floaters and the opacity in my right eye was really not that bad. I had the surgery because of it's tremendous success rate (98%), thinking it would give me 20/20 vision, which would have been great because of the endeavors I have.	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I went to a Muscul/Skeletal center, there I was diagnosedwith reheumatoid arthritis, He also did other test and said I tested positive for Lupus , but because of the lack of other systems he didn't think I had that , also mild back flow of left heart valve. Treatment was a shot of cortisone in each hip and priscribed(prescribed)Meloxicam 1 day for 6 weeks this all helped a great deal.So I started packing for my road trip to NJ, the day before I awoke not feeling myself couldn't put a finger on it, waited a couple of more daysDepression thats what it is, called doctor asked him if Meloxicam could cause this , he said he didn't think so, he priscribed(prescribed)Sertraline, had servereside effects, extreme heart burn , sore throat, tongue and mouth blisterslost 8 lbs in 5 days, not complaining about that part.     Dr. prescribed Lexapro, rapid pound heart, weak and tingling in arms and legs.Stoped this drug. Asked Dr. about something natural he said St. John Wort. After all this I'm still depressed    so I did some research on St. John Wortside effects do not seem to be so extreme as the chemical drugsI've been taking now for 5 days a little upset stomach but other than thatI seem to be able to tolarate it and am still depressed but last 2 night I woke up from sleep with rapid heart beat could this be from St. John Wort or the Depression.

post_6034607	1319679	Forgetfulness	170	1415532	Aug 16, 2010	Hi - 2 years ago I went for some ear balance tests with a Neurologist.    In the CT scan he learned that I had some calcification in the brain.    I didn't ask any questions as I didn't think was a big deal.    Since that time, I have been experiencing times where I can't find the right words or I mumble a few words and literally find it difficult to remember things.    I also get anxiety when I am going to drive a distance....I wouldn't not be too worried, but my family has a history of Dimentia(dementia)and Alzheimers.    My mother passed a way one year ago from it and her brother prior to that and currently one other brother is in the latter stages of the disease.Additional concern is I had a had fall (slipped while at work in kitchen and fell head first slamming left lobe of head into wall (the office heard the bang came to my aid)....I went taken to emergency and Doctor said to follow the needed steps (wake up every 2hours) and asked if I played any active sports - I said no....Currently I am in employment transition and partially I like to believe this forgetfulness is more about stress....but then one never knows right?Should I be concerned and revisit this with Neurologist ?Any advice is appreciated.thank you.C	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_5949974	1300333	Anti-Ageing Gene Linked To Alzheimer's	170	704281	Jul 24, 2010	SIRT1, a gene associated with anti-ageing has been linked to the production of an Alzheimer's protein according to a study in Cell.Researchers at MIT found that SIRT1 appears to prevent production of damaging A-beta peptides that make up amyloid plaques which form in the brain of people with Alzheimer's. They also showed that learning and memory improved when SIRT1 - protein was overproduced in the brain of mice engineered to develop Alzheimer's.SIRT1 is a "rescue gene" that repairs the damage done by free radicals and prevents cells from dying prematurely. The gene also causes mitochondria, the power plants of cells, to produce energy at higher levels that are typically associated with younger cells.Alzheimer's Society comment:'SIRT1 certainly appears to be everybody's favourite gene at the moment. Activated by calorie restriction and a compound found in red wine, research has shown that it can help animals live longer. Now scientists may have linked it to the control of a key protein associated with the development of Alzheimer's-type dementia.''Much more research is now needed before we can find out if drugs that activate SIRT1 could be used to fight dementia. However, dementia research is desperately underfunded. Dementia receives eight times less funding than cancer research. If we are to beat dementia we must invest today to find a cure for tomorrow.'Dr Susanne SorensenHead of ResearchRef: SIRT1 Suppresses beta-Amyloid Production by Activating the alpha-Secretase Gene ADAM10," Gizem Donmez, Diana Wang, Dena E.

post_6166835	1	Caregiver from 1,000 miles away--Anyone else? Advice?	221	1452620	Sep 21, 2010	Sis was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer Stage IIIc August 2007. I flew from MI to TX for surgery, recovery, first chemo treatments, stayed 2.5 months. Of all her friends, only two take her to chemo treatments. As for a caregiver, I'm "it". She has no children, and our parents and brothers are deceased. I have made subsequent trips when she needed me.    She is 50 and her CA125 numbers are climbing again--rapidly. Oncologist has her on estrogen blocker this time, as no tumors detected on CT scan, no symptoms, and is weary of months and months of chemo (3 recurrences).    Her employer has been wonderful, and she is still working, mostly from home.I have Bipolar Disorder II, managed caregiving pretty well in the past, but worry that I won't be able to give her the quality of care she needs next time. I love her so much and am terrified of losing her. The best I can do now is long phone conversations 4-5 times a week (we've been Phonezillas even before cancer). We've started 3 way phone conversations at her appointments. It helps to be as present as possible and ask her oncologist questions and listen to what she says to her doctors. Internet searches have yielded no results for sole caregivers from a distance. Is there anyone else out there?Any advice is most appreciated.	3	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_6241319	1367464	Caring for a mentally ill son	221	518117	Oct 12, 2010	I have a 31 yr. old son that is very mentally ill plus he has substance abuse problems. I have been taking care of him during the last 10 mths. He has been hospitalized 4 times since December. Weeks at a time hospitalizations. And just this past Friday night I had to call 911. My son was heavily drinking. Police spent 2 hrs. doing an intervention. They were so amazing with him. Finally get him in the ambulance and about 8 hrs. later hospital is calling me to get my son. They did not keep him. I have had my son in counseling, group therapy and he has been on so many different meds. Nothing improves with him. But, this is not something new with my son. I have been struggling with his issues since a young teen. He is bipolar to the extreme. Yet, sees things that are not there...such as demons. Talks to them as well. This comes and goes. Actually the mental health care system is a joke. I researched our mental health care in this country. We got a D rating in the United States. And I certainly believe it.I could write a book on the experiences with my son over the years. He even did 5 yrs. here in a Kentucky State Prison. And mainly it was due to him being mentally ill, not taking his meds etc. The prison he was in was the state mental/medical prison for Kentucky. And I am a strong believer in this. No prison should have care of the mentally ill. My son has been bad off before, but since getting out of prison, he is only far worse. Even the police said the other night, that jails and prisons are no place for the mentally ill. The police here in the town I live, take intervention classes for when they are called to a situation with the mentally ill. I commend them highly on how well they handle the situation with my son.But, what my post is about now is myself. I too am bipolar. But, to a much lesser degree than my son. I am bipolar type one .And I was stable and had been for some long time. Yet, going through all this with my son now, I am just so very tired body and soul. I am 53 and have health issues as well. COPD and high blood pressure.I have taken care of the terminally ill as well. I cared for my Momma some months while she was terminally ill with pulmonary fibrosis. Approximately 3 to 4 yrs. ago. She passed away 4 months after a lung transplant. She though was a sweetheart of a patient. Sure it tore my heart out to know my Momma would probably die. But, this with my son is so much harder. I love my son most dearly. But, I am to the point, that I feel a hospitalization is in order for myself now. I have been hospitalized 5 times for my mental illness. Mainly during depression episodes. And I have no one to help me with my son. I have a husband but he is my son's step-father. But, my husband allows my son to live with us. Not many men would put up with that I don't believe. I have 2 other grown children, but they are not able to handle their brother. They love him but they have lives of their own as well.I am just at ropes end pretty much. And this son is counting on me. Which I got to be there for him. But yet, at what cost to my mental health and physical health.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

However, many don√¢ Ä ôt stop to think about protecting themselves from injury. By protecting the caregiver, we also provide a safe and secure environment for such care.A solution to lessening caregiver injury rates while also improving worker preservation could be as simple as improving training for workers, researchers say. Instruction should focus not only on physical lifting and transporting methods, but also on strategies for dealing with erratic or aggressive residents, according to a team of investigators from Penn State University.√¢ Ä úIn our research, we saw a cascading effect,√¢ Ä ù Deirdre McCaughey, assistant professor of health policy and administration at Penn State, said. √¢ Ä úEmployees who had no training or did not believe their training prepared them well had three times more injuries. Those employees were also much less likely than non-injured employees to recommend their organization as a place at which to work or seek services.√¢ Ä ùThe study examined home health aids√¢ Ä ô work with long-term care residents and relied on data analysis from the federally funded 2007 national Home health Aide Survey-Researchers reported on findings at the 2010 Academy of Management Annual Meeting in Montreal. They are expanding their research to examine aides√¢ Ä ô roles and viewpoints. Operators who invest in √¢ Ä úsoft√¢ Ä ù resources, such as training, can realize benefits, McCaughey said. Employees who were trained had lower injury rates and lower turnover. Below are some of the most common injuries that occur to a caregiver, these injuries or contagious illnesses must be properly monitored and prevented.Common Caregiver InjuriesOne of the most common injuries experienced by a caregiver is back injuries. Other dangers include contact to needle sticks when caring for someone with diabetes or someone who needs managed injections, as well as blood-borne pathogens that may be controlled in saliva, urine, and blood. In addition, contact to infectious illnesses or diseases may also occur. Still, by far, the most common injuries among caregivers are those that involve the back, neck and shoulder joints.	0	injuries,training,caregiver	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_6028216	1318180	adult urinary incontinence	221	1390966	Aug 14, 2010	My mother is experiencing urinary incontinence.    She is in her mid-60s and has stage 4 emphysema.    Her incontinence used to occur only when she was having an exacerbation.    Over the past couple of years it has become daily, and she is now having accidents without realizing it.    She currently uses adult diapers, takes medicine (forget the name), and uses pads where she sits and in her bed.    She's still having frequent accidents, and our efforts to help her are hampered by her reluctance to discuss it.    I think she is also avoiding going to the bathroom because of the exertion it takes. I guess my question is, is there more we can be doing? Also, how common is it for seniors to not realize they've had an accident?	6	adult urinary incontinence,Urinary Incontinence	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_6200763	1358060	caregiver losing job to nursing home-heartbroken	221	465080	Sep 30, 2010	Hi all. I've only just found you. Can you not advertise your forum on other forums? Many of the people who post questions are caregivers but they're just asking med, condition type stuff. Anyway, writing from UK, have been looking after mum (90) for 13 years. Heart problems, blood disease, dementia, all the usual attendant difficulties.She never complains and is always thanking me. It makes me feel so bad because sometimes I'm thinking that did i really go to uni and go into a profession just to clean up wee and poo? Garden , ciggie, beat myself wth proverbial sticks and it doesn't feel so bad when i come in.i am so angry, so fuming, so frustrated and so helpless you cannot imagine. I feel like my head's about to blow apart.Firstly, we are ordinary people and have to rely on the authorities to give us help. I have carers to help me for a total of 3 hours a day and do the rest of the 21/7 on my own.Last week mum was rushed to emergency >resussitation. I had been up for    weeks, snatching sleep when i could. In the middle of this life and death activity, I was watching the stainless steel moving and the floor started rising towards me. I alerted a nurse before I collapsed.Mum now in hosp and I have been told it's enough now, I can't do it any more, it's too much for me. OK. I see that. I am mentally and physically exhausted. So i    asked the Community for more help. They were wonderful -    not.! more hour day and no night care atall! I'm devastated! I don't want my little mum to go into a nursing home, I can't bear the thought of it, but what can I do?    I haven't stopped crying for a week- I'm in bed re conking out - and haven't seen my mum. Plus, my sister's been to the hospital and they've mixes up all her meds. Can you imagine how I feel? I was on here for 3 hours last night writing to the hospital. I told them my mum does not need any help up the Stairway to Heaven thank you, she's in there so we'll have her a bit longer. They've given her aspirin even though i gave them a list in big red writing of all her allergies, Stopped her heart meds which keep her going, refuse to put sides on the bed and I nearly burst a blood vessel when I heard she'd fallen out of bed.So, anyone out there who can tell me how to cope with placing my little mum in care? also, anyone know any UK laws re. this joke of a *** hospital?And, whoever believes, please send me peaceful thoughts cos I am exhausted but the adrenalins going re. all the hosp stuff and i am so so agitated. Thanks in advance	4	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_6081429	1330377	Caregiving for dad, was supposed to be a share responsibility!	221	1140037	Aug 29, 2010	Hi everyone.I am already a member here at Medhelp, however I am new to the Caregivers community. (Thanks Tuckamore!!)I am permanently disabled. My dad is 81 years old, has dementia, diabetes, copd, triple bypass, sleep apnea, chronic pneumonia, he aspirates his food, is    incontinent, oxygen dependent, has short term memory loss due to a coma last Thanksgiving, etc, etc. the list goes on and on. Last Thanksgiving he was in a coma, he had pneumonia and H1N1, he was placed on a respirator and was not expected to live.... but he pulled out of it! (his doctor said he has 10 lives... not 9!)He has no short term memory, so every thing is repeated all day, every day! He was in a nursing home after the hospital and between my mother, brothers and sister we ALL agreed that we could care for him at home if we all pitched in.... that was April! I find that I am the ONLY one aside from my mother who is taking care of him... and it's 24 hours a day! Even though I am disabled due to back and neck injuries, and I am on morphine 24 hours a day I have to sleep in a recliner in the living room because he will wake up at night and wander to the kitchen! He almost always doesn't have his walker, which he will fall down without, however since the walker was given to him AFTER the coma he doesn't remember it. I can't let him "raid the refrigerator" because he is a diabetic and often his blood sugar is over 200 with insulin!!I am upset with my siblings. My dad has been home since April yet I am the ONLY one here giving him care 24 hours a day! My mom is 79 and is starting to lose her hearing... she has trouble walking due to ankle problems, she wears braces on both ankles every day. Most recently I have found one of her pills on the floor, three times in two weeks!! She is forgetting things and she becomes angry with dad because he forgets his walker, (and for many other reasons, like the incontinence). She will yell at him and I feel so bad! I end up stepping in and telling her to take a break, now matter how tired I am!! So now it looks like I have to start caring for her also.I guess I came here for some moral support.... I don't know what else to say to my brothers and sister that will get them to realize that I am overwhelmed with all of this! I am thankful that dad survived and I am thankful that we could take him home to pass away. He is now doing better and his doctor said he "looks better than he has in 10 years" so I know I am doing a good job but I need a break!! I just know I won't get one!Thanks Tuckamore for letting me know that this caregiver world is here.	7	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_6013188	1314774	How to care for stubborn parent?	221	1288437	Aug 10, 2010	I hope this is the correct forum for my question.    My father had two strokes in the last seven years.    I am an only child, so my mother and I take care of him.    He no longer works, but sometimes drives to buy groceries since it's close to home.    My question is -- how do you take care of someone who does not want to be taken care of?He is the most stubborn person I know.    My mother is a nurse, yet he won't listen to her when she tells him he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats.    In 2003, he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of Papa John's pizza.    We thought that would be his reality check.    Guess what?    It wasn't.Then 3 years ago, he had a second stroke.    Reality check?    No.    He still does not believe in doctors, nor medicine. He has diabetes, just like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.    He also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and arthritis.    He refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes.He has also suffered from depression for years, even before the stroke.    He was married with two children before he met my mother. I'm sure that's one reason why he's been depressed all his life.    Not to mention he was the eldest of 8 children and had to leave school to work and take care of them.    He does not want to move in with his brothers and sisters (who are also retired but on the other side of the country), because of pride.Lately he's been having memory lapses after waking from naps.    We don't know if these are mini-strokes, or just part of the long-term effects of strokes.    Again, he is stubborn; he does not want to call his doctor about this.    He says he's fine, but I'm scared that one day something serious will happen to him.    Since I'm an only child, he's home alone whenever my mother's at work and I'm at work or class.    No one is there to watch him and make sure he takes his meds or doesn't overdose on them.    We worry that when he has his memory lapses, he'll overdose on the meds, not realizing he had already taken them.Please, if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_5998002	1311316	Have you had a Vacation or Respite?	221	547368	Aug 06, 2010	Hello Members,Where has this summer gone? As you may know I am no longer a Caregiver. My dearest father went to his Heavenly Home on May 13th of this year. And yes, I miss him every day.As I am getting ready for my third mini-vacation since my dad's passing I think about all of you. Have you been able to get away for some rest and relaxation? It is so important that you do so.In the final months of dad's life I guilty succumbed to Hospice's insistence that I allow myself a Respite. I am so glad that I did. It gave me renewed strength as I returned to the 24/7 challenges and rewards of caregiving. I hope you are all able to do the same.I wanted to remind you that just a few nights away every few months is so important to your physical and emotional health. Taking care of the Caregiver is vital.In between those Respite times I found other ways to rejuvenate. An afternoon visiting a close friend, a few hours at the beauty salon, a quiet dinner with a loved one, a walk through a zoo or a short shopping trip for just you are things that can refresh you. I even made the trip to my local grocery store a special occasion. I browsed through new selections, tried their free samples and always bought new products. Often I found one for me and something for dad. It was always a special treat to see what I had managed to find at "just" the grocery store.What may help refresh you is a individual choice but I encourage all of you to do just that. Now with summer drawing to a close don't forget to take time to enjoy an outdoor activity or two.Be the best caregiver you can by talking care of you too.    PLEASE share with us what have you done or what do you do to refresh and renew?My heart goes out to all of you.Your Fellow Caregiver in Spirit,~Tuck	0	Health,emotional health,Hope, help	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_6026102	1317684	Semantic dementia	1465	1036846	Aug 14, 2010	Hi, My father was detected with semantic demantia about a year back. He was having problems in identifying objects and spelling out the words. The MRI scan showed degradation of the brain and the neurologist confirmed semantic dementia and ruled out Alzheimers. He has been on a medication of Aricept 10 mg a day for the past 9 months along with his heart medication (ecosprin) post his bypass 4 years back. However since his neuro medication started, his condition has gone worse since earlier it was only about speech. Now his speech has gone much worse, ability to converse has gone down, and doing basic activities like shaving etc needs reminders. He has also started talking a lot to himself.Keeping these symptoms in mind, we took a second opinion and the new doctor completely stopped Aricept. He has instead precribed the following:(For morning & afternoon)1. Parkin-plus (hydrochloride tablets)2. Norwayz (Idebenone tablets 45 mg)3. Corus (Vitamins, mineals, fatty acids & amino acids)For night1. Sove IT 6.5 (Zolpidem Tartrate Extended-Release tablets)2. Folinine (Folic Acid, Methylcopalamin & Pyridoxine)3. Olimelt 5 mg (Olanzapine)The earlier symptoms like talking to himself, being always agitated etc. has gone down with these medicines. However his speech has turned slurry and made him quite inactive. If he gets up in the night, he doesnt remember to go off to sleep and keeps wandering in the house.I am confused because none of the medications is stalling the degradation. What step should I take now? Can I send you the reports to look at?Thanks for your help...	0	None	None

We have not done a microarray to find out if there might be a microdeletion or microaddition. Both of us are healthy, and we will be going in for bloodwork to see if either of us have the translocation. Has this specific translocation ever been documented in the medical field? Are there specific abnormalities that might be associated with this translocation? What is the probability that the child will be normal? If one of us has the translocation, is this cause for reassurance?

However Everytime she go's to a Doctor, she has to go through explaining, and they wind up retesting her constantly, always with the same results.    Why is there such a misconseption amoung Doctor's, I even seen a Doctor on CNN, SAY " Thalassemia is only in People of Asian, Mediterainean, and African decent"    We now know this is incorrect.    Because her father's Family is true German, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, PALE SKIN.Why are Doctor's not being educated as to the possibility of this.

We are wondering what are the chances of having a unhealthy baby with any disorder, syndrome or retardation after having to deal with the loss of our precious angel. Were scared to concieve(conceive)and go through something else that is so life changing and we didnt get very many answers from our genetisis during our sons 2 week stay in the hospital. He did tell us we have a 1 in 1,000 chance of having another trisomy 13 baby. Does that make us more at risk to have a baby with problems in any other way? Its very hard to loose a child and we are scared to try and loose another or have a very unhealthy baby. We would rather adopt and help another child have a family than bring another child into the world with problems.	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6384383	1399776	is genetic counseling suggested?	146	1514835	Nov 22, 2010	Hi, I have a question about whether it is worth looking into cancer genetics for this situation in our family:Aunt was diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer at 48 and ductal breast cancer at 59. Grandmother (aunt's mother) was recently found to have a 4cm tumor in her stomach at 81, still waiting to hear what kind of gastric cancer. This is a family of hispanic descent, from a place with high prevalence of gastric cancer. Aunt's husband was H Pylori positive and was treated for chronic gastritis. At least two sibings of grandfather (grandmother's husband) died of stomach cancer, no info available about the specific type. Aunt's children (ages 20 to 40) all have some or all symptoms of GERD, IBS, hemorrhoids, gastritis, esophagitis and receive treatment for it. Following grandmother's diagnosis, this whole situation seems to have many coincidences. We have heard that one relative diagnosed with diffuse gastric cancer before 50 and other relative with gastric cancer qualifies for testing for the mutation for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (CDH1?) However, we know that from an ethnic point of view there is a higher risk of developing stomach cancer according to the literature. Given that the aunt's children already present gastrointestinal issues that are being treated for, we wonder this family should also pursue genetic counseling/testing and if there would be any benefit from it. In other words, if this kind of history warrants looking more into it. If it does, is it possible to test one/two of the cousins if neither the mother or grandmother are available and still obtain meaningful results?	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6325885	4	Does it sound like my 4 year old daughter has Marfan's?	146	514428	Nov 05, 2010	Since she was born, she constantly held her thumb in her fist, so tight at times, I couldn't really break her from it until she was about 2 years old.    She's just started school this year and she doesn't talk as well as we'd like, so we had a speech theropist come out and check on her (said she'd out grow it), but she noted my daughter was "disabled" because she can't grasp a pencil or scirrors right and she has problems with motor "vision"?    EVERYTHING I was reading about MArfan's totally discribes my daughter to a T!!She has....*Flat narrow feet (quite long)*VERY long fingers*A dip in her chest*very flexable more in her hands*Muscle weakness in hands (can't grip pencils correctly)*The roof of her mouth always was high but narrow and had a very hard time bf'ing her because her teeth would cut into my nipple...*Thin and tall with long arms and legsShe's only seen a doctor a few times, butthe doctors we see are very fast during visits because she's a twin.    The other twin is perfectly normal.    She talks, does very well in school and doesn't have anything wrong with her hands or vision.I'm just wondering what else this could be. Every other tissue disorder NEVER mentions what she has (vision and grasping issues) and then for the school to say she was disabled really ticked me off.    I'm just trying to find answers and I don't want to look crazy if I took her to the doctors to figure this out and them tell me "nothings wrong".    Obviously something is wrong is she's "disabled"...	1	Marfan's syndrome	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6343357	1390549	Healing After Surgery (w/Connective Tissue Disease)	146	1132175	Nov 10, 2010	I am a 30 year old woman with regurgitation in my aortic, tricuspid and mitral heart valves as well as a aortic dilation. It is thought that I have some sort of connective tissue disease, but I have never gone in for a formal diagnosis.My question, in regards to this issue what problems occur with after-surgery healing... This past Thursday I underwent a gum graft procedure and all went fine but a few days after I had a occurrence of non-stop bleeding and had to go back in to get more stitches, the next day I had more persistent bleeding in a different area and had to go back in for more stitches. My peridontist says he has never encountered this problem with a patient and doesn't know why it has happened to me. Especially since it was a few days after the procedure and therefore I was already clotted and healing. We are wondering if it is tied to the connective tissue issues. I am now wondering if I should have gone in for a proper diagnosis so I would know all these issues that could arise.Would a connective tissue disease affect this sort of healing? Is there something I can take/supplement to assist my body? My Peridontist was talking about taking vitamin K as it helps the body with clotting (not sure if i need to talk to my cardiologist about it, but i think it may already be in the multi-viatmin i take anyway).	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

He is 75, turning 76 in December.He's had bad mood swings, and his memory has slowly deteriorated. Just recently, about a week or so ago, her Grandpa put something in the toaster oven and cranked it up to it's highest heat. He walked away from it and soon the food was inflames. Her and her Grandma had to put the fire out, and her Grandpa had completely forgotten he put anything in there.Now this is what scared her. Her Grandmas bday was yesterday, and the day before that her Grandpa was going to make a big poster board card for her Grandma.    Her Grandpa forgot that one of his daughters had two baby girls, and said she had two baby boys. My friend had to constantly ask him if he remembered, and he had a confused look on his face and kept saying "no she has two boys".

post_6274384	1374911	Early stages of Alzheimers? What to do?	146	1482953	Oct 22, 2010	My friend is concerned her Grandpa might have Alzheimers. He is 75, turning 76 in December.He's had bad mood swings, and his memory has slowly deteriorated. Just recently, about a week or so ago, her Grandpa put something in the toaster oven and cranked it up to it's highest heat. He walked away from it and soon the food was inflames. Her and her Grandma had to put the fire out, and her Grandpa had completely forgotten he put anything in there.Now this is what scared her. Her Grandmas bday was yesterday, and the day before that her Grandpa was going to make a big poster board card for her Grandma.    Her Grandpa forgot that one of his daughters had two baby girls, and said she had two baby boys. My friend had to constantly ask him if he remembered, and he had a confused look on his face and kept saying "no she has two boys". Finally, after awhile of my friend saying it was two girls, he goes "Ohhh right" and even forgot their names. Here's the worst part, her Grandpa forgot her own name [my friends]. She was shocked, but tried not to show it, and asked "Grandpa are you serious? Did you forget my name?" and asked him to write it down to see if he remembered.

A week later I went to my ob's office and we discussed the resutls (I though everything was ok, because the radiologist - dr not tech- said everything looked great) and was confused and shocked.    She said that the report a mild dilation of the right cerebral ventricle.    Huh?    I was so surprised I forgot to ask questions.    She said since my genetic testing came back normal that she was not too worried, but I have to go see a hgh risk perinatologist to get another sono.So my question is what is this a marker for.    When I asked my ob she kind of danced around it.    I am not even sure if I should be concerned.    I did some research on line and the interent is pretty scary.

I'm wondering if it's common to have this many genetic issues (though thankfully none are difficult to deal with currently) and/or if there is any relation between them?	1	hla-b27,ANA+,MTHFR,Reactive arthritis,factor V mutation	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

My doctor sent me for blood work and the results of my PTT-LA and PTT-LA Mix of the Lupus Anticoagulant reflex came back slightly elevated.    In addition, my MTHFR result showed a single mutation (C677T) identified. What does this mean for me? My doctor wasn't concerned about this. Should I be?

There is grandma and grandpa which are my dads parents.. I look more like grandma more then I do the rest of my family, and I do not look like grandpa at all. and the only reason I resemble my dad is because of his mothers features that he has as well.. BUT my grandma had another son.. with a different man.. and i have been lead to believe that my mom cheated on my dad with his brother... Now my dad is a little over 3/4 Cherokee Indian.. He has black hair.. a darker skin tone, brown eyes, and the long face.. his BROTHER.. from a different father.. has blond hair.. a lighter skin tone, blue eyes, and a round face.. my mother has brown hair.. very pale skin tone.. and blue eyes.. with a round face.. I have light brown hair.. blue eyes.. very pale skin and a round face.. i have looked at the different dominant and recessive genes.. and i have almost all recessive genes.. so wouldn't it be more likely to have ALL recessive genes if BOTH of my parents did as well?? is it possible that my mom has been lying all of these years? and that my uncle is really my father?? should i tell my dad and maybe have a test done??	2	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

But he sometimes makes comments to make me second guess... here is the story:My bf and I were broken up. I went out of town and saw an ex- we had sex on Jan 13th, used a condom.    I had a NORMAL/REGULAR period Jan 16th.    Came back home, got back with my bf and had unprotected sex multiple times...    Had positive pregnancy test Feb. 9th.    According to my doctor I am due Oct 23rd by last period dates and Oct 21st by ultrasound.... and that conception date was Jan 28th.PLEASE tell me I am not wrong in believing that the baby is my bf's and NOT my exs....

post_6087170	1331699	Please help me figure out what's going on...Thanks!	146	1428288	Aug 30, 2010	I have been dealing with various health issues over the span of my life and have often been referred to as a hypochondriac. After doing some research, I think I could have a connective tissue disorder, possibly EDS.I have a long family history of hypermobility and joint problems. My mother had to have both of her hips replaced in her early 50's and now they want her to get her knee replaced. She also suffers from serious bruising, migraines, arthritis and degenerative myopia, which will eventually blind her. She was told she has a connective tissue disorder, but aren't going to test her because she is done having children. I come from a long line of tall, thin people who have chronic joint and pain problems.I have been told I have a variety of diagnoses: Patella femeral syndrome, bursitis, fibromyalgia (doesn't quite fit b/c pain is mostly in joints and I don't have the tender points), migraines, TMJ, depression, unexplained neck and back pain...etc. I often feel like they think I'm malingering or seeking drugs, since I have so many seemingly unrelated problems/complaints.My symptoms: I was born with a punctured lung and curved feet that had to be massaged straight. When I was 18, I developed TMJ and the cartilage came off my jaw joint on one side. I used to exercise, but soon developed problems with my knee in my twenties (chronic pain, clicking, and popping of ligaments or tendons). Now I am beginning to have pain in my other knee and ankles. I can no longer run or even walk very far without pain. I also developed chronic pain in my hips. Not sure if it qualifies as subluxation, but my hips seem to slide out of place spontaneously and I have to do a certain movement to pop it back in (makes a loud noise). I get a lot of headaches and migraines. I bruise easily, often not knowing what happened. I got into a minor car accident five years ago, and have had terrible neck and back problems since. My neck or back can "go out" by the slightest movement or deep breath....The pain is debilitating! I have ALWAYS had gastrointestinal issues. I deal with intense constipation (doesn't respond much to diet- I eat a lot of high fiber foods, drink water, etc) I recently had surgery on an anal fistula. Doctors don't have a solid explanation for my issues.I can no longer wear a purse, cross my legs, exercise, wear low heels, or sit for long periods w/o pain....And I'm only 33 yrs old. I am rapidly losing the ability to do things I used to do with ease. I am in most of the time now. I feel like my body is falling apart and I don't know why.After looking at EDS, I began to see there may be an answer for all of my issues after all!My mom (plus many in her family) and I have high palates, long limbs (not disproportionate to height, though), and very soft skin.In regard to hypermobility I have always been very flexible. I can touch my thumbs to my wrist, push my fingers far backwards(among many other tricks), put hands flat on the floor w/out bending knees, put legs behind my head, and probably more (waiting for physical evaluation).I plan to pursue medical help, but I'm first doing my own research so I don't get dismissed as being a "healthy person" that doesn't really have anything wrong with her. It is so frustrating to suffer from pain the way I do, and not be taken seriously. I am determined to figure this out. This isn't normal, right??Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

post_6117019	1338625	Is my dads health affecting my sister now?!?	146	1439073	Sep 08, 2010	My twin sister is 26 years old. Has been diagnosed with ulcerative colitis since she was 20. Was recently taking a strong antibiotic classified as a "sulfa" drug. Had a severe allergic reaction with flu like symptoms that kept her in bed for a week. Just when it looked like she was getting better she started convulsing and lost all control of her limbs. She stayed in the hospital for 3 days and they finally said she had Dystonia brought on by her reaction. She hasn't gotten better. She still can't walk without her legs giving out on her, her hands are stiff and claw like and she has a hard time finding words. She is easily fatigued and has lost weight. My question is this...my dad has hemachromatosis (sp?) and a b12 deficiency. I've read several articles that say a B12 deficiency can sometimes be misdiagnosed with Dystonia. Is that common? She has been sick much longer than before she took the antibiotics so I wonder if there is more to it genetically and that just set her off. Please help...she is my world and I would love to see her living life again.

post_6083714	1330897	undiagnosed rare genetic condition in adult	146	1429546	Aug 29, 2010	I am a 43-year-old female, 5√¢ Ä ù4, 120 lbs.    I have lost most of my hair (which, until two and a half years ago, was waist-length and still growing).    I√¢ Ä ôve lost most of my muscle tone and cannot restore it no matter how vigorously I exercise; I have become as shapeless as a half-filled water balloon.    In the space of six months my skin became so loose I now resemble a Shar-Pei from the chin downwards---this was not due to weight loss.    I have lost all of the fat in my face.    During the past year I have been experiencing    severe short- and long-term memory problems, have lost much of my vocabulary, and am having trouble performing some simple tasks such as opening containers, connecting (e.g.) USB extension cables, and following written and verbal instructions.    This spring I was found to have a solid benign golfball-sized nodule on my thyroid, which is NOT affecting thyroid function. At the time, the sternomastoid muscle near the nodule was swollen about a third of the way up my neck; that swelling has now reached my ear.    (I visited an ENT specialist recently, as recommended by my endocrinologist; this caring fellow---his first words, after I√¢ Ä ôd explained briefly what was going on, were √¢ Ä òWhat do you want ME to do for you?√¢ Ä ô---looked up my nose, in my ears, and down my throat, felt my neck; I asked him why the muscle on my neck was swollen.    He said he didn√¢ Ä ôt know, that he couldn√¢ Ä ôt help me, and left the exam room.)    Though my pulse rate is usually normal, my heartbeat feels more like a pounding, which is causing me a great deal of discomfort (my blood pressure is normal).    I have no energy.    My temperature is often elevated, though I have no infections that I am aware of.    And for many years my face, neck and arms have been covered with lesions.    These are not pimples (I have tried every prescription and non-prescription skin preparation on the market, and nothing has had ANY effect on them).    These lesions erupted spontaneously form scalp to knees over a period of three days; it is only during the past five years that they have been concentrated on my face and neck---they used to heal just as spontaneously.    Now they never heal√¢ Ä ¶    I√¢ Ä ôve BEGGED dermatologists to biopsy these lesions and they have REFUSED!     I have no idea whether the skin lesions are related in any way to the symptoms that have appeared during the last two and a half years.I√¢ Ä ôve become a freak.    I have not left the house in two years except to visit specialists, who for the most part have shooed me out of their offices (average time spent in the exam rooms: ten minutes).    The experience I described with the ENT specialist is typical. Interestingly, the two that didn√¢ Ä ôt dismiss me out of hand were female doctors---but I can√¢ Ä ôt say that even they tried terribly hard to find out what is going on.    I feel as if I am trying to get a vet to examine a cockroach, and that I have become so hideous in the past two years that even doctors (the male ones, anyway) do not even regard me as a person. They don√¢ Ä ôt want to hear, they don√¢ Ä ôt want to see.    Apparently they do not think there is anything WORTH salvaging.I have been all over the Internet looking for a rare-diseases site with an advanced symptom-checker feature, but such a site, as far as I know, doesn√¢ Ä ôt exist---and the descriptions of rare conditions are so brief that they are useless to me.    As I don√¢ Ä ôt have anything communicable, I can only assume that I have a rare genetic disease.SOMEWHERE there must be a database into which someone can enter five or ten symptoms and at the very least narrow down the list of conditions that might be causing the symptoms.    Does anyone know of such a database, and how to access it?Or is there a doctor reading this forum who can give me a clue as to what is happening to me?Please do not advise me to go to the NIH, a university hospital, the Mayo Clinic, etc.    I cannot afford it.    And even if I could, I could very well end up in the office of another doctor who thinks the world is a reality show/beauty contest and that diagnosing or treating a disfigured middle-aged woman isn√¢ Ä ôt worth his while.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6073697	1328507	Severe case of Peripheral Thyroid Hormone Resistance-what can we do?	146	1426610	Aug 26, 2010	Hello;I am new to this community and could not find a specific thyroid expert forum so I apologize for asking here. i have a condition called Peripheral Resistance to Thyroid Hormone with severe hypothyroidism that does not respond to medication. I am female, 32 y.o. and was affected by Chernobyl fallout at the age of 10 and had a bad case of Mono at 11, and heavy metal poisoning as a teenager while working in art school. My mother had symptoms of hypothyroidism all her life (multiple miscarriages, infertility, chronic pain, hair loss, fatigue etc.) and my aunt has a nodular goiter with hypothyroidism. I had problems with cold intolerance, hair loss, weakness all my life but in 2007 due to sudden onset of body swelling along with all these symptoms was discovered to be hypothyroid. I was treated with T4 for a while and it helped with all my symptoms but after an accidental overdose with T4-T3 combination drug I had a very brief thyroid storm and most of my tissues became resistant to thyroid hormone. My symptoms became progressively worse and include drastic facial skin thickening leading to progressive deformity, severe hands and feet edema (permanent), confusion and disorientation spells, severe electrolyte deficiencies, overall body swelling, fast hair loss, I can't walk without a cane and sometimes fall, have muscle wasting and pain, hearing loss and constant blurry vision; electrolyte deficiencies almost killed me a few times (Potassium drops cased seizures and inability to move). I become lethargic and don't know where I am when it gets colder, and swell up immediately when it gets a little bit warmer outside. My blood    tests indicate incorrect response to T3 in different tissues. I am completely disabled, on Medi-Cal and financially lost everything I had due to illness. My boyfriend is struggling to help me. We have failed to find help locally as most endocrinologists don't know anything about such cases, as those who do don't take insurance. We are asking if anyone knows what tests we need to do if we can to find out the cause of my resistance. My tests show the pattern similar to the patients with thyroid receptor mutation that runs in the families or sometimes can be caused by other factors like radiation exposure, and we suspect this is the case. Please help us, if you can. Thank you in advance;Maria.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

So I honestly do not know where to put this, but I figured since it sort-of runs in the family that I would give "Genetics" a shot.Basically I have short, thick legs. I'm about 109 lbs, 5' tall, exercise at least 30 min every day and have an average diet (all I drink is water or juice, never soda; not big on fast food, eat whole wheat... etc.). I've always had a hard time loosing weight, though, and I could eat virtually nothing and still have tummy issues.Anyway, I have short, thick legs, and lately it's been bothering me. Is it possible that because I'm carrying more weight on my upper body that it's hurting my legs? I say genetics because my mother has the same issue, as did her mother, and my brother is really tall and thin.If no answer, a suggestion on where this question should be placed?	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_5986537	8	Digeorge/ LOW cell 8 count	146	1308088	Aug 03, 2010	Hi, My son has been through a great ordeal and is recovering well from his Brain Damage, recent MRI suggested he has recovered nearly fully after a cardiac arrest (Tube blocking in ICU) the only issues they can see is Basil Gangalia damage and specifically around balance so not sure he will walk or when he will walk. We are waiting to see a heart specialist also as he has a vascular ring (double aortic arch) which needs surgery. Due to the discovery of the DAA they have tested for digeorge 2 weeks ago and awaiting results, they have some tests back for Calcium and they are fine, also done lympocytes and collectively the figures are fine and they progressed to do a T and B cell split, all has come back fine except something to do with a lower cell 8 count, when he said lower apparently they benchmark the reading against healthy children of a similar age. in our case a 16MO, there wasnt an exact match though for his age so they tested on an older child and it was lower in comparison to an older child. My consultant says not to worry and its not low enough to warrant intervention but its low enough to repeat the test in say a years time. has anyone got any further information on this and what cell 8 does specifically. The reason he was put in ICU in the beginning is that he got paraflu, im worried incase the reason that it affected him so bad is that his immunity is low, if that was the case surely he would need intervention now to replace the low count.	0	low cell 8 count,Digeorge,brain damage,vascular ring	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Issues with mixing upthe words or getting ahead of himself. Problems talking, problems communicating. Very numb, horriblesharp pains. Along with a very foggy thought process. Some days seem worse than other days. He hashorrible anxiety and has problems leaving his house. Very bad anger issues where he wants to hurtothers and himself. He is not like that normally. Has been battling depression and suicidal thoughts.He has had a test for lupus and those came back negative, as well as a ct scan that showed nothingwrong. He is currently awaiting his MRI results. We have several ideas of what it could be. But he hasno way of earning income because he isn't allowed and can not work, lives with his mother who also cannot work. Money is hard to come by and no one in this country wants to help you if you dont have it.Getting a medical card and Social Security have been a mess.

post_6806525	1498263	how do you know they cant stay at home?	170	1147527	Apr 07, 2011	My mother is 86 and has dementia. She is on Namenda and also takes a blood thinner and a high blood pressure pill but that is all. I took her into my home when she had either a small seizure or a TIA on the way home from a protime test. I went down to stay the hight with her and she told me she was afraid to stay alone any more. I took her home with me the next day and she has been here several weeks now. We are cleaning out her apartment and will auction off what she does not want to keep. One of my brothers is in Missouri and the other is pouting because she didnt want to move in with his and his wife so he will not talk to her on the phone or help to move her possesions. I had to hire help to move her furniture.When she is under the least bit of stress or gets tired she falls apart. her memory becomeslike swiss cheese and she looks rather wild eyed and moves at a frantic pace. She makes up things in her mind and insists they are true, sort of like false memories. I know they are not correct what she is telling me but if I disagree she becomes angry. She will sit for hours trying to make heads or tales of a EOB and become so frustrated the rest of the day is a bust. If I try to distract her or tell her I will take care of it for her she seems to become dispondant because she can not do it herself.I have no family support on this as one brother is far away and the other is being a nut. He even hung up on her the one time he did talk to her. Why would anyone be so selfish? I keep trying to thinnk of things for her to do, but she doesnt want busy work she wants something important she will say. Yesterday she was having a good day and I left her to run a errand, never again! I came home to find her in a frantic panic. She insisted I had been gone for hours and she was running around the house with the phone in her hand like she was going to call someone but she couldnt remember how to dial it. I had been gone half a hour she insisted it was for hours and hours. The rest of the evening she sat and stared at the floor. She told me she had gotten up and sat in a chair for a long time in the night.my questions is how do you know when it is not safe to keep them at home any longer? I work out of my home so I am here all day long. I rarely get any time alone and when I do leave it is disasterous. I am not sure what to do.I wnat to keep her with me as long as possible, but I see her slipping away at a alarming rate. Non of us realized how badly she was deteriorated until I brought her tolive with me. Her apartment was filthy, not at all like my mother. She had simply gotten beyond it. Can anyone give me some answers as to how to reassure her and as to how to know when I can not keep her here any longer. I worry I will do the wrong thing and something will happen to her. Thank you for any help you can give me or advice.	10	at home	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

He started having these episodes about 2 months ago.    He is normal for about a week and then on day one he is a little confused...thinks he see's a mouse, thinking someone was in the room but they weren't, want's to eat & has has a stomach tube for 6 years and can have nothing by mouth, etc.    On the second day it is alot worse...he tries to walk without his walker & falls, want to take the car for a ride, tries to go up the stairs, goes and gets food out of the cabinet, thinks things that happened years ago just happened, etc.    He never forgets who anyone is though.    On the 3rd or 4th day he is similar to the first day & then starts to jerk (not like a seizure) expecially when asleep.    He has had numerous EEG's and they are all normal - not seizure activity.    He will jerk his head/upper body about twice a minute.    He then sleeps for pretty much a whole day.    Then he is back to normal again for about a week or so when the whole thing starts all over again.    He has has blood work - normal, blood gas test- normal, taken off a couple of medicines.

post_6574903	1443773	Some words of encouragement	170	363281	Jan 23, 2011	I just want to post some possible words of encouragement. I, too, experience some short term memory loss, but, I can almost always remember if I think about what I am trying to remember hard enough. A Lot of the symptoms, may not be related to Alzheimer's. I am a member of a Peri menopause/menopause group, and believe me, there are many many ladies there that have the symptoms (some very sever) but do not have the disease of alzheimer's. According to the research done there and the books they have recommended, being in the perimenopausal/menopausal state can definitely cause Alzheimer's like symptoms. As our hormones fluctuate, they cause different changes in our brains, and unfortunately, this is one of the main ones. This can even be true for some men, no, they do not have menopause, etc, but, they can have some hormonal dysfunctions.I guess what I am trying to say is, just because you have all these symptoms, and to be honest, who doesn't at some point due to stress, etc, it sure does not mean you have alzheimer's. For the women, I suggest a good, heart to heart with your gyn about this, he/she may put you on some estrogen, either natural or bio-identical. There are a lot of other helps as well.This article will explain what I am trying to say, it is rather long, but, well worth the read. I hope this helps.http://www.power-surge.com/educate/menopause_and_the_mind.htmIf you have any questions, please feel free to PM me, I may not always have an answer, but, I will do my best to help anyway I can.Hugs to allSusie	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_6570328	70	70+ yr old mother obsessing about kids	170	693120	Jan 21, 2011	My 71 year old mother is a whiz at cross-word puzzles, has an active social life but has been plagued with unjustified thoughts about her kids.    No matter what my brothers, sister and I do it isn't enough.    It definitely wasn't this way before.    She was a great mom and has always been active in her life, not depending on us kids for any kind of reinforcement.    For the past few years she has been so hard on judging my siblings and my Dad.    At one point she sounded so venomousness towards my Dad and brother that I was sick over it.    I sent her a long email suggesting reflection and counseling since she should be enjoying her successes in life.    She seemed to get it, but is back to the meanness that she failed as a mother because no    one calls her.    It is irrational!    My one brother's job requires him to travel internationally non-stop so when he is home, he needs to catch up with his wife and kids.    My other brother communicates through facebook and email all the time.    The other... well he's not so good, but is a great person.    My mother is very active, in Florida for the winter with my Dad, golfing and playing bridge.    These tirades of hers come so unexpectedly.    She seems to be festering over not being called on Sunday's.    It's more than that.    She seems to find fault with many things and there is no pleasing her.    I'm the oldest and am at a loss for how to help my other siblings.    I am only suggesting we placate Mom and contact my Dad privately.    He may be suffering with this as well.I guess my question is if this is a sign of alzheimer's since my Mom doesn't seem to have any other symptoms.    She does repeat herself alot on the phone, but I think that is usually at night after she has had a few glasses of wine.    We are all very aware of when we call her.Very worried.	0	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_6431946	1410516	Is anyone familiar with this device..	170	1427317	Dec 08, 2010	www.    free patents online.        com    /        20090204058.     pdfSorry have to space it out or the filters will block it.THis patent is a device that claims to remove aluminum and other compounds from the brain.    Its an electrode with cathode placed on the back of the skull and the anode placed up the nasal passage.    A low DC current is passed through creating a field that will draw the toxins toward the anode for removal.     This is the first invention Im aware of (thats not saying anything ;-) that addresses the removal of heavy metals like Aluminum from the brain.    Its non envisage and it states could be used on a daily basis if needed.Among the inventors listed Johnson and Johnson either bought it, or financed the development.Where is this device? If need be I will build on out myself, if they are squatting on the patent.Here is part of the patent:BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the cleavage of beta amyloid protein precursor from the intracellular membrane often produces a protein AB-42 which is incompletely removed by normal clearance processes. Over time, this protein is deposited as a beta amyloid protein A√é ≤ plaque within brain tissue, leading to the local destruction of neurons. The A√é ≤ plaque deposition is also believed to provoke an inflammatory response by microglia and macrophages. These cells are believed to respond to the plaque deposition by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although the inflammatory response may be provoked in an effort to clear the brain tissue of the detrimental plaque, it is now believed that this inflammation also injures local neuronal tissue, thereby exacerbating AD.High levels of aluminum, copper, iron, and zinc have been found in the brains of AD patients. For example, Finefrock, J. Am. Geriatr. Soc., 51, 1143-1148, (2003)It has been hypothesized by Finefrock, supra, that age-related dyshomeostasis and environmental accumulation are responsible for these high metal levels.Furthermore, it is believed that these heavy metals play a critical role in the precipitation of BAP. It is known that BAP binds to these heavy metals and even has highly specific binding sites for copper. Accordingly, high levels of these heavy metals have been found in BAP plaques. Huang, J. Nutrition, 2000, May 130(5S Supp.) 1488S-92S).Moreover, since both copper and iron are redox active, these metal-laden deposits act as catalysts for cell-free redox reactions that generate hydrogen peroxide and consequently highly toxic hydroxyl radical.Accordingly, it is believed that higher-than-normal levels of heavy metals in the brain are deleterious because they not only promote the deposition of BAP plaques, a portion of them promote oxidative stress when deposited.Aluminum is of particular concern. It has long been hypothesized that aluminum plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD, although this point has remained controversial. Nonetheless, according to Gupta, Cell Mol. Life Sci., 2005 Jan. 62(2) 143-58, the neurotoxic effects of aluminum are beyond any doubt. Moreover, it has further been reported that, once it has entered the brain, aluminum is fairly persistent. Yokel, Toxicol. Sciences, 64, 77-82 (2001) has hypothesized an aluminum half-life in the rat brain of about 150 days, and in the human brain of about 12 years. According to Yokel, supra, repeated aluminum exposure paired with aluminum persistence produces aluminum accumulation. Therefore, the neurotoxicity and the long-half life of aluminum have made it a potential therapeutic target for AD.I have a patent in a different field but accidentally found this since it is tagged with the word electrode (which is what my patent is listed with)    After reading this I started connecting the dots with some symptoms I and many others are experiencing.    The strange "migraine after 2 drink" sufferers seems to be growing and it was only after I found this site that I learned I was not alone.I watched a documentary just recently called "what in the world are they spraying" (you can watch it on youtube, just search for it by name) and suddenly realized this could be the cause of our problems, and if hard data can be collected to back it up, would shed light on the increase of AH we see today.I would be willing to subject myself for testing if anyone is willing to discuss it further.    If a sample of tissue from the sinus area was tested and came back positive for the same compound they are using for the geoengineering spray campaign we see over our heads on almost a daily basis, (aluminum, chromium, and sulphur compounds) we may have some answers.Comments can be directed to "dallasgoldbug    at     g mail    dot    com"	3	AH cure patent  aluminum	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

She as mini strokes and heart problems with moderate dimentia(dementia).    She has 4 kids who could only agree on one thing that they all wanted her in a nursing home but she said she didnt want to go so I move her in with me.    I have a small house though so we had to build her a suite as we lovingly call it.    She is still pretty self sufficient .    I make her meals, do her meds, her cleaning, all her bills and provide 24/7 care and monitoring.    The first issue was that I have 2 small children (10 and 5) and my husband makes 15k a yr so figurng out how to afford to provide round the clock care was a challenge,    After spending 200+ hours cleaning out her home of 50 years myself, we sold it and she said se wanted to pay me mothly to be home with her.    I am wondering do I claim it so if I need help (medicare) evetually I can get it or no?? I have done this alone for 17 months with no breaks and a now so anxious and sick that most days I feel I am losing my mind. Everyone is mad at me, and I feel so alone and while I love doing this for her    feellike I have lost a part of me.    I am depressed    -- I am a state certified CNA and have worked in the field for 5yrs before taking care of her.

post_6401174	1403709	Please Forgive my Absence	221	547368	Nov 28, 2010	Hello Members,I must tell you how sorry I am that I have been away from our forum for so long. Caring for my beloved father left me exhausted and losing him left me with over whelming and often consuming grief. Following his death I lost many close friends and family. It seemed never ending. And with every loss it brought back the pain of losing dad even more so.My husband and I continued our plan to winter in FL. So in addition to grieving I was busy getting our home ready to close up for the winter. Packing, cleaning and distributing many of my dad's belonging was a very huge challenge, especially as I suffer with chronic pain.Dad's been gone just six months and it seems like forever since I last hugged him. I miss him so deeply. So forgive me for saying once again to hug those you are Caregivers for..... every chance you get. Don't miss an opportunity to remind them how much you care and what a value they are and have been in your life. Make sure they know that they made a positive difference in the world and your life. It's important for them to know that they are worthy.And again don't forget to take care of you. In order to be an effective Caregiver you need to be healthy in mind, body and spirit. Thank you to all of you that are compassionate and caring enough to give of yourself and to be Caregivers.Bless you All,~Tuck	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

Also is this curable through the medicine prescribed to him.Any advice would be immensely valuable.Thanks a lot!	8	dementia,alzheimer's,senile dementia,Headache,neurologist,ct scan	None
post_6699527	1473279	Dementia in early age	1465	1288247	Mar 02, 2011	I found out a while ago that dementia runs in my family, its in my mothers side but its normally in very old age im only 21 yet show a lot of signsI√¢ Ä ôve had a horrible memory since I was a kid. In Primary School I would be asked to get booklets off a teacher in another class I would get to the classroom and forget what I was there for. Right now I cant remember a thing from high school yet im remembering a lot from primary. Its not all long term as I forget about daily needs like hygiene or just simple tasks ive been asked to do.List of symptoms I have or may have (that are common in dementia):-There may be a lack of concern, apathy or decreased spontaneity = not sure about this one but it sounds like the same as the social withdraw one.-Speech and language abnormalities begin early with rapid progression = I would always read    and mix up simple words like with/that/where/there etc (my reading and talking skill has advanced thought as before I couldn√¢ Ä ôt read a book due to attention)-Unkempt, may repeat words, some primitive reflexes which are normally absent in individuals may become obvious like grasp, suck and snout = I do forget story√¢ Ä ôs at any point in them, forget what im talking about or reading and repeat the same thing several times. Also see Twitches bellow.-Have difficulty in naming common objects or pictures = This is something that is only happening recently where I would forget the name of something-Problems with keeping personal hygiene = I would get dressed and everything in the morning and feel like im forgetting something to later on find out it was that I haven√¢ Ä ôt washed that day (I would normally think im missing an item of clothing)-Might withdraw socially, be unable to emote, empathise or sympathise = My friends and I have a joke that im not human due to what im like I cant really get upset or show emotions when I should be (I do get very upset when its involving animals but that might just be due to cartoons when I was little). I do spend most of my time in my room rather than going out as well.Random problems I have:-Twitching in the neck area = have been told its due to having to much energy and no way of it releasing so it turns into the twitches.- Ive only noticed this recently but im finding it hard to realise the difference between what happened in dreams and real life (Im sure I was banned from my dentist for taking a huff and swearing at them but ive been told I never done that yet it was very vivid and the fact I remember it so well)- I sometimes have a vivid nightmare and wake up and have hut my boyfriend as if I have just kicked or punched the monster in the nightmare.Also i dont really tend to see things that arent there if anything its normal like seeing things in the dark or at the corner of your eye.If you would like to know anything more please just sayThanks	1	None	None

post_6502787	1426944	Taking androgens for skull and facial hair growth?	146	1549332	Jan 02, 2011	Hi MedHelp,Let me begin by stating a few things about myself. I am 19 years old and a freshman in college. Late in high school, I finally decided to do something about how I looked about twelve years old. I went to an endocrinologist who finally prescribed me IM testosterone shots for delayed puberty, which i took for six months. It was enough to jump start a growth spurt which sent me from 5'8" at the beginning on the treatment to almost six feet (over the course of these two years, the bulk of the spurt happened the year of the testosterone treatment).Now, let me lay out the problems which I want to do something about now. Puberty has been progressing smoothly in all areas except facial hair. I have body hair (except chest hair hah) so it seems facial hair is the only lacking aspect of pubertal development. The only place that hair is noticeable is on my upper lip, and even there it is weak.my other problem is that it seems during this growth spurt that my head did not grow with my body. I have a disproportionally small head for my body. The circumference of my head is roughly 54-55 cm on my 150 lb, 5'11" body. As you can imagine it looks and makes me feel strange.I've been doing research on these problems to find solutions to them. It seems that I can kill two birds with one stone by taking androgens, such as testosterone or DHT. I have another appointment which my endocrinologist in about a week so I will try to get my testosterone prescription renewed, but I wanted to check in here because the research I've done so far is hardly relevant to my problems and the answers remain cloudy.I am also looking into getting hGH, IGF-1, or IGF-1 lr3, because of the known effects of these on skull/bone growth. And these wouldn't have the same effect on producing facial hair, but also would not cause hair loss like it is rumored dht does. What about pGH?My main problem is head size. I can deal with waiting for more facial hair. If we prioritize skull/jaw growth, what would you recommend I take? Testosterone? will DHT solve my problems at the cost of hair loss? hGH or IGF? Something completely different? I tried to do as much research as I could before coming here so I could intelligently discuss this, but i ran into a dead end and really need dialogue with professionals now.Thanks so much, I hope to hear from you soon!	4	HGH,IGF-1,IGF,igf-1 lr3,pGH,dht	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6759253	1487239	Ehlers danlos confusion	146	1642850	Mar 22, 2011	Hello everyone, i joined this forum in hopes of talking with other members that have ehlers danlos syndrome.    Im so confused.    I was diagnosed 5 years ago, but have not been back to see the doctor due to sever panic attacks.    As of now i have a chiari 1 malformation, 2 herniated disks in my neck as well as kyphosis of the cervical spine.    The worst in my left shoulder.    I have had 4 operations on my left shoulder and they only thing that is left is a fusion.    My right arms dislocates, as well as both hips, and my right wrist.    My ankles are so unstable i can barely walk at times.    I do not take anything for pain, and wow day by day its getting worse.    What confuses me is i do not have the stretchy skin like some members do.    I do not dislocate constantly, its more just the sever pain in my joints, with them cracking all the time.    My ribs sound like a bag of potato chips if i move the wrong way.    So im curious to see what other patients symptoms are.    My grandfater died of a ruptured aortic anyerusm, and my dad had one reparied, and now has another.    No one in my family has a history of ehlers.    So after years of research i am so confuse.    I am a 27 year old male.	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

My cardiologist siad this is very rare to see in utero.    I have another scan next week to see how much it has grown.    My first baby has down syndrome and a hole in her heart, I have been told that this is no way connected and is most likey a connective tissue disorder of some kind.    we are having a test done on the baby for marfans syndrome but this will take a month for the results and could be inconclusive.

post_6807887	1498542	. . .Lost. . .	146	1374347	Apr 08, 2011	Our daughter (21 months) has been having issues from day one. She is cognetively well pass her peers, and functioning at 2 1/2 years. However, she's always had feeding and thriving issues. She's been hospitalized four times from not eating, mild edema (hands & feet), febrile seizures (at 99.9 degrees), and hypothermia (94.7 degrees for no apparent reason). She's been diagnosed with a hole in her heart (ASD with RVD), duodenal ulcers, esphagus erosion, hiatal hernia, febrile seizures, high grades fevers (105) with no apparent reasoning, and failure to thrive. She's had a biopsy of her upper GI track. They found no helio-bacteria, they found a small number of esonophils, and nuetrophils.The feeding tube dilemma has been on the table for almost a year now, however, they decided to try giving her periactin increase her appetite. It's been working wonderfully!! Yet, her new GI has tried taking her off of it and she stop eating/drinking all together. It's sad to think that she needs a medication to eat/drink.Without her pepcid, her bowels literally burn her skin upon contact.Without her prevacid she is absolutely miserable - won't eat, sleep, and when she is sleeping she doesn't want to get up, and she non-stop cries.She also, on VSL #3 (probiotic) without it her stools are looser than normal, and VERY foul smelling.They just don't know where to go with this anymore, and were being told to look into genetics.

post_6638372	1458816	chromosomal aberration	146	1598550	Feb 11, 2011	Hello.At the beginning sorry for my English but not speak it fluently.My name is Joanna.    I`m from Poland. I have a question, and I would be very grateful for your reply. I am a mother of nine month-old son. A child born in the 39 weeks of gestation, the forces of nature, has 9 points in the scale Appgar. After birth, was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. The doctors noticed dysmorfism features of the face, decreased muscle tone, underdeveloped penis, foot clubfoot. The child has undergone heart surgery. In the meantime, has been done to assess its karyotype, which showed chromosomal aberration. Then performed additional testing of the child, my husband and the FISH method, after which his son was found in the following drawback: 46, XY, der(6)t(6;8)(p25;p22)pat. Unfortunately, the geneticists could not tell us what are associated with this defect. Overall, we were informed that at present aberracjach facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies and developmental delay. After some time the doctor suggested us to make a study of the clinical use of microarrays CGX-12. We were told that after this trial the doctors determine exactly which genes have been translocated, and then it will connect in the case of our son. We waited for the results of 5 months. In the end we had an appointment at the clinic and what we heard? The fact that doctors do not tell us! I must admit that I am disappointed because we were promised some interesting results. I do not understand why doctors can not say anything, since geneticists know which genes are on different chromosomes, and for which those genes are responsible. For me it is not logical.We have received just such a result: the genetic material was considered a change of the nature of chromosome aberrations (deletions and duplications). Change is detected at the terminal deletion of chromosome pair 6 (region 6p25.3 - 6p25.1, the size of deletions - 5.20 - 5.23 Mb, according to genomic position HG18 128,203 - 5,462,343) and a terminal duplication of chromosome pair 8 (region 8p23.3 - 8p22, the size of duplication - 15.26 - 15.49 Mb; genomic position by HG18: 192262 - 15451730). Submicroscopic chromosome rearrangements are a frequent cause of intellectual disability, behavioral disorders and congenital malformations. The test result confirms the genetic link of the disease. ACGH study using the NimbleGen 135k chips CGX-12 allows the identification of changes submicroscopic    located in regions of the genome rich in genes of more than 20 - 100 kb.That's why I write here. Looking for any information found on the web results (except U.S.), which described patients with similar defects. I must admit that this article I learned a lot more than the doctors. Can You help me?

On december 15th and december 17th I had unprotected sex with a friend but he did not ejaculate in me. I did not have sex again until december 24th, this time it was with my husband.    We had unprotected sex 2 times that night and he ejaculated in me both times. I researched things online and they all said my most fertile day was the 24th. When I went for my first ultrasound, the doctor had prewarned me that the date of conception may be off cause I was farther along in my pregnancy than other women. My ultrasound was on march 16th and the computer said I was 13 weeks and 1 day. I found that to be highly inaccurate cause 13 weeks and 1 day ago I was still on my period. I need some guidance as to whom is my babys daddy, my friend? Or my husband? Could the ultrasound machine been off and could I just have a larger than normal child?

post_6659168	1463815	Chromosomal Deletions & Duplications on Microarray	146	419309	Feb 17, 2011	Recently there has been a tremendous increase in the number of questions posed about duplications and deletions found on chromosomal micro-array (CMA), and I post this in hopes that it will help alleviate some of the frustration so many people encounter when given information about abnormalities seen on this kind of chromosome testing.First of all, it's important to understand:    CMA analysis is pretty new science.    The ability to test for micro-deletions and duplications can be considered as still in its infancy, just recently borne out of the past decade.    Therefore, very little information is currently available about what they are finding on these tests.    It's important to remember that Genetic testing, in comparison to other sciences and medicines, is a fairly new method of approaching health care, and what can be identified in a scientific laboratory setting does not necessarily translate into medical understanding.The human genome with all its complexity has the potential for an infinite possibility of variations: duplications and deletions can now be detected and reported, but with no historical basis for comparison, interpreting the existence of these chromosomal variations remains a challenge.    Oftentimes abnormal results don't lead to any answers at all simply due to the fact that many of these results are new findings.    Not necessarily that the condition never existed before, simply that it was never documented -- the technology simply did not exist. Think of CMA testing where it is today as akin to the finding of the Rosetta stone:    we can see the stone and identify the markings, but we are unable to understand what it means due to a lack of reference.It is surely frustrating to be do test after test that yields no helpful answers, only more questions.    The only encouragement that I can offer those who are struggling with these concerns is that as genetic understanding continues to advance, identifying and collecting the information gained by such testing is the path by which science can arrive at answers in the future. The information may be an enigma today, but it may lead to understanding and answers for those affected now and in the future.Best wishes to all.	9	chromosomes,Duplications,Deletions	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6739713	1482653	Genetical Disease - Stressed & Help Needed	146	1636644	Mar 16, 2011	Hi,I had my second EMG test yesterday to help my consultant understand the changes in my condition since my last EMG at the beginning of January. I would REALLY appreciate some help understanding what the consultant told me, so I will give a little background to my condition first:About 2 years ago I started to feel tightness in my calf muscles at a time when I was playing semi professional football. This tightness quite quickly reached a level which meant that I had to quit the sport. Since then my legs have become more and more dysfunctional meaning that I have gone from being able to still play low excecise sport, to where I am now, struggling to even walk.In the 1st year I had many different treatments including: physio, acupuncture, orthopedic shoe implants and spinal and brain MRI scans. None of these tests / treatments either helped or found anything.At the end of last year I saw a neorologist and he did some tests including and EMG in January. On the basis of these tests I was told that I had a neurological condition that was affecting the messages sent from the brain to my legs and that this was a genetical condition. The consultant said that the existence of constant leg muscle twitching also compounds that diagnosis. I was told that the the challenge for them now is to find out what condition this is. I have no speech problems (something that they keep asking me about) but my legs are getting worse on a daily basis and the twitches have now extended to my stomach, back and arms.I had the second test yesterday and the consultant said that he would write up his report and then call me back to discuss, but that it may be that I need to have another test in 4 months to help understand    the evolution of the this problem! He did tell me that my legs have "changed considerably" since January but that there hasn't been "much change" in my arms.I am stressing out about this because I don't know what my condition might be, I have idea what the prognosis could be and the consultants are reluctant to suggest anything until they know for sure. This leaves me in a position where I am struggling to move around on a daily basis to the extent that I fall over at least once every two days, and this is seriously damaging my confidence and mental state! I feel that if my legs keep regressing at this rate I will be in a wheelchair by the end of the year - I really need to know what is happening to me.I really appreciate any help and guidance that you may be able to provide, so thatnkyou in advance for any kind advice.Scott	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I've never had any major heart issues other than an occasional palpitations. I had a pneumothorax about 10 yrs ago, which hasn't reoccured. I have a negative thumb sign (which means my thumb does not extend beyond my clenched fist) but a near-positive wrist sign. My arm span is 6'2, my actual height is 5'11 1/2. However, my armspan to height ratio is only 1.03, under the 1.05 limit people say for Marfan's. I do have long arms and somewhat spidery fingers. I had an echocardiogram 2 years ago and it came back normal. I do look tall and thin, but My doctor thought I might just have characteristics of Marfans and not have the actual disorder. Might this be the case? Do I have Marfan's or just symptoms of it. Like I said, no major heart problems ever in my life up to now.

post_6673621	1467369	Insight on this topic?	146	1504275	Feb 22, 2011	Hello,I am hoping you all may have some answers or insight on this topic.My mother's side of the family has a long history of an unknown and definitely genetic disorder that occurs most commonly in the women on our side of the family. What I have found:On my mom's side of the family, the women develop a problem around the age of 45 that my mom describes as "just being so incredibly sick". They are unable to hold their heads up or get out of bed or eat or swallow. My mom's mother died of "heart disease" very soon after that. My mom saw an infinite number of gastroenterologists before finally being given an SSRI. She was skeptical, but it worked. My mother has mitral valve prolapse, collagenous colitis (at least, that's what it seems like), has dislocated both of her shoulders, and has had poor eyesight for her entire life but has had worsening night vision over the years and was diagnosed this month with color blindness (only one color, and it's definitely brand new). My mom's brother developed cataracts around the age of 45, has severe acid reflux, is extremely thin, and has a stutter (like his dad did).I personally have been diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (it was diagnosed while I was on Adderall(adderrall), so I'm not sure what the real diagnosis should be), mitral valve prolapse, and IBS. I had shoulder surgery at 15 and osteochronditis dissicans at 8. I am allergic to almost every antibiotic and had a lot of food allergies as a kid which disappeared (not the antibiotic allergies). I think I am especially susceptible to bacterial infections. As a kid, I almost always had a sinus infection (doctors would comment on the appearance of my nasal cavity) and I had strep every month for a year until I got my tonsils out (and then I only got it around twice a year). At 19 I developed a pretty bad staph infection that was in my fingernail, in my wrist, in my scalp, in my mouth, and I think in my connective tissue (as indicated by petechia, bruising, red puffy lines under my eyes, severe muscle pain, etc.)My hair is also getting lighter, but I don't know if that's relevant. (Not lighter from the sun, I promise.)I am currently on medical leave. I am extremely suspicious that I have a connective tissue disorder, but I'm not sure. My aunt has Crohns, her daughter has mitral valve prolapse, etc etc etc.I noticed the other day when the sun was really bright in the mirror that I have these shiny yellow/gold rings on the outer edge of my iris. I don't think I have Wilson's disease, but they are really shiny and weren't there before. My mom has them as well (I checked with a flashlight) but hers are much more full looking. None of us have liver problems (besides my uncle, but he's an alcoholic).I am experiencing problems with severe back pain, knee pain, shoulder pain, elbow pain, and bone pain (forearms, lower legs). Ibuprofen helps but promethazine helps more. I have been experiencing floaters more than usual (but I've had a lot of them ever since I was a kid). I see flashing lights since I was 15, and experience every symptom of transient ischemic attacks besides the paralysis. I attribute this to my orthostatic problems which cause my cranial pressure to get too low.Anyway, please contribute if you have any ideas.	0	ehlers-danlos,Back pain,Joint Pain,collagenous colitis,connective tissue, help,shoulder instability,phosphenes,visual snow, help me	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6669353	1466328	malabsorption and congenital metabolic disorders	146	1480566	Feb 21, 2011	I am the 57 yo mom of two teenagers. After a lifetime of medical complaints (various autoimmune symptoms or dx plus major fatigue and periods of brain fog and severe atrial fibrillaiton)    we all had micronutrient testing recently. My daughter and I both had alarming results, with severe deficiencies (my son's were disconcerting but not as bad). My dd also had high levels of toxins in her system. These toxins were all things she has either no    exposure to or much less than the average person. her report suggested they can also come from undigested amino acids stagnating in her fats and becoming toxic. My tests showed deficiencies in numrous areas. both reports suggested all the logical anticipted remedies, if our lifestyle habits are bad, but said that if those don't work to refer us to a center that specializes in congenital    metabolic defects. Our GP told us this is out of her expertise, so she made an appointment to consult with doctors from the lab (Genova Diagnostics). It took a while to get one, but I believe that appointment happens this week. Meanwhile, my dd has gotten very sick with a bug, and slept 24 hours a day for 2 weeks, and is still very weak a week later. Blood tests showed low white blood cells (absolute neutrophills, 1316 L, absolute lymphocytes, 363 L & absolute bosinophils 2 L) and she was hypothroid. She turns 16 next week. We are waiting preliminary test results to rule out now    Lupus, whch her paternal grandmotehr and great uncle died of, and leukemia which her maternal great aunt and my cousin died of. Both my children have been dxed with generalized anxiety with mild OCD. My son has a long history of mood disorders (he also falls in the exceptionally/profoundly gifted range, and mood/personality disorders are common with that population). I have such severe a-fib that nurses have told me they've never seen anyone with my EKG be responsive, however our standard blood panel is usually close to ideal. My first grade school nurse was adamant that my brother and I were malnourished, but bloodwork 'proved' her wrong. However, I have never felt well and alert, and have lookd for someone to look deeper than those blood tests my whole life.My doctor believes we have a genetic disorder that blocks absorption of protein and fats. Not just the three of us. Most of my relatives who descended from my paternal grandfather share our medical history, and some have gotten seriously ill and died from autoimmune disorders such as leukemia, ALS, colon cancer. Nearly all of us are hypothyroid and have atrial fibrillation. at least three have had Alzheimers, and most of us had early onset migraines. Our most common body type is very tall, very thin (underweight) until age 30, and then rapid weight gain. There are several suspected and a few confirmed cases of mental illness. We are a tiny family (fewer than 150 people with my maiden name have been born worldwide since 1900), from a tiny island ( 25 km square). this makes it    quite possible we have a very rare condition, perhaps never identified.My doctor supports my researching this and that is what I have been trying to do, but most cases I find of metabolic disorders show up in newborns. Our family is outdoorsy and most members appear robust, with few diagnosed serious illnesses, other than one baby that got leukemia at 6 months.Any suggestions or ideas as to what this might be or where to begin searching?Many thanks	0	malabsorption,metabolic disorders,congenital,Genetics	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6666206	1465502	Hoping for someone that has been through this??	146	1457838	Feb 20, 2011	I don't even know where to start. I did the first trimester screening and I got a phone call this afternoon from a genetic counselor saying my risk for Down's was 1 in 6,265, which she said was good. Then, she tells me my risk for Trisomy 13 & 18 was 1 in 57. I was scheduled for a Level 2 Ultrasound this afternoon and they measured the fluid at the back of the baby's neck and there's too much fluid. The bladder is 3x bigger than what it's supposed to be. Now I have a 1 in 5 chance for a baby with Trisomy 13 or 18. My options? Do nothing. Wait until I'm 15 weeks to do an amnio. Or do a CVS which is similiar to an amnio. I opted to do the CVS because I could do it today. They stuck a huge needle in my stomach and took some of the tissue from the placenta. My risk for miscarriage for doing the procedure was 1 in 100. I now have to wait 7-10 days for the results which will tell us everything we need to know chromosomally. Chances are I will find myself not pregnant very soon.We also found out it was a boy.Feel free to ask questions if anything is unclear. Glad to say I participated in the first trimester screening.

I have a now four year old who was born early. 5 weeks she was 8'2 and 17 in she came out very dark perhaps stayed in canal too long but was no other signs of any problems. I breastfed but got sick a bit so she had to be on bottle she became violently ill projectile vomiting the Doctors admitted her and tests were done so many test nothing came back why this was happening trying all types of milks even soy nutramagin. Finally I was cleared to begin breastfeeding her again and she stopped. She completely recovered leaving doctors baffled until about 6 months old I noticed she was not developing normal. I startedbaby food and projectile vomitting came back with a vengeance    She was diagnose as failure to thrive    became so ill she spent more time inpainent at Duke diagnosed with this and that then told no that is why sent home overage over with no answers Doctors said they didn't know but keep doing what I was doing. One time there an it saw her and wanted to do a swallow test    turned out she was inhaling food and drink and causing her to develop pneumonia. After hearing that the hematologist told us she had neutropenia which meant no immunity to fight illnesses anytime she gets a fever she must be hospitalized. So if she ate or drank it would turninto pneumonia and after using an antibiotic a body would build immunity to it and eventually be useless    on top of that the geneticist came and told us they found a genetic abnormality a small deletion Chromosome 1q21.1 however they didn't know what it was or y she had it. No information. What to expect for her future shortly after that a G tube was placed and we were told    she would not eat again and possibly    have speech delays if she would speak at allthat was March 2008	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6638787	1458915	aberration	146	1598550	Feb 11, 2011	Hello.At the beginning sorry for my English but not speak it fluently.My name is Joanna.    I`m from Poland. I have a question, and I would be very grateful for your reply. I am a mother of nine month-old son. A child born in the 39 weeks of gestation, the forces of nature, has 9 points in the scale Appgar. After birth, was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. The doctors noticed dysmorfism features of the face, decreased muscle tone, underdeveloped penis, foot clubfoot. The child has undergone heart surgery. In the meantime, has been done to assess its karyotype, which showed chromosomal aberration. Then performed additional testing of the child, my husband and the FISH method, after which his son was found in the following drawback: 46, XY, der(6)t(6;8)(p25;p22)pat. Unfortunately, the geneticists could not tell us what are associated with this defect. Overall, we were informed that at present aberracjach facial dysmorphism, congenital anomalies and developmental delay. After some time the doctor suggested us to make a study of the clinical use of microarrays CGX-12. We were told that after this trial the doctors determine exactly which genes have been translocated, and then it will connect in the case of our son. We waited for the results of 5 months. In the end we had an appointment at the clinic and what we heard? The fact that doctors do not tell us! I must admit that I am disappointed because we were promised some interesting results. I do not understand why doctors can not say anything, since geneticists know which genes are on different chromosomes, and for which those genes are responsible. For me it is not logical.We have received just such a result: the genetic material was considered a change of the nature of chromosome aberrations (deletions and duplications). Change is detected at the terminal deletion of chromosome pair 6 (region 6p25.3 - 6p25.1, the size of deletions - 5.20 - 5.23 Mb, according to genomic position HG18 128,203 - 5,462,343) and a terminal duplication of chromosome pair 8 (region 8p23.3 - 8p22, the size of duplication - 15.26 - 15.49 Mb; genomic position by HG18: 192262 - 15451730). Submicroscopic chromosome rearrangements are a frequent cause of intellectual disability, behavioral disorders and congenital malformations. The test result confirms the genetic link of the disease. ACGH study using the NimbleGen 135k chips CGX-12 allows the identification of changes submicroscopic    located in regions of the genome rich in genes of more than 20 - 100 kb.That's why I write here. Looking for any information found on the web results (except U.S.), which described patients with similar defects. I must admit that this article I learned a lot more than the doctors.

I'm 28 and my boyfriend is 31 years old. I've never been through this type situation before. On the genetic side, neither my family or my boyfriend's family has any history of this. I have alot of questions running through my head. What all exactly am I looking at? Like, when it comes to talking to the genetic counselor and if something is wrong with my baby. What exactly causes this to happen? Is it cause my babies are to close at age? Could this be a bad image or glitch in the last ultrasound?

post_6588054	1446896	help! lumps on head	146	1576816	Jan 27, 2011	I've had this big lump/bump on my head for a few years from what i can remember, i'm not sure if i had it when i was younger, i never really examined my head lol but it seems like this lump is getting bigger and now the past year or two i've noticed another 2 smaller lumps on my head. They are located near the front of my head but to the side. I'm really worried as to what this may be. It has never been painful, and i don't get sick often or suffer from headaches or anything, that's why i have never bothered to get it checked out. it feels hard like bone but spongey and squidgy on the outside. My mum tells me that my grandmother has them on her head too. I would really appreciate it if anyone experiencing the same thing or anyone who knows what it may be could give me some more info.

post_6488240	1423553	Beginning to think it's a rare genetic disorder	146	1516472	Dec 27, 2010	Struggling for answers, finding it hard for doctors to belive me as I am so young. I am a RN and what I was taught is that if you know there is something wrong with you there is. My higher family also has odd, similar symtpoms, so I'm beginning to think it's one of those rare genetic disorders. I have a positive ANA, joint pain, extreme fatigue, initially diagnosed with lupus, now I swear I have symtpoms similar to MS. I have spine and bone problems as my family does. I have major GI issues, like my family, and it looks like I will need a bowel resection. My mom has lupus. My aunt has symptoms milder than mine. My other aunt has DI and is allergic to every antibiotic once she takes it. Because I am 23 doctors tend to label me as a psych case or a drug seeker. For that reason I know I must get a diagnosis in order for them to believe me so that I may get my symtpms treated and go back to doing what I love and do best; Hospice nursing and finish getting my NP in palliative care.

I was then adivised right away to terminate pregnacy .. I am schedule for a CVS this week and I am mess!

My lab group have used the technique "sleeping beauty" to insert two genes, which are next to each other, into a animal model.We have checked for gene expression by looking on protein levels in different tissues for the two genes. But the "problem" is that if geneA has a high expression then geneB had an low expression, and vise versa.In some tissues we see that both genes have expression but then neither of them are as high as when only one of them was really active.I am beginning to think that maybe two highly expressing genes cannot be to close to each other and be "maximum active" at the same time?Maybe the unwinding and processing of the DNA for geneA will make it hard for geneB to be treated the same way because of the small distance?Thank you for your time, this is my first time I write at a forum like this and my english is not the best.Thanks for answer!/Anders	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6461082	1417186	Virtually hairless body	146	1536759	Dec 17, 2010	Hi. Quite some time ago I caught part of an item on TV that was discussing the genetics of hairless/virtually hairless people, as though this indicates some health condition. I've tried searching online to find out about this, but have found nothing; so I was wondering whether an expert could give me some information, such as whether this has a name.I'm asking because I have a virtually hairless body - my legs are smooth, plus I have scant hair in the armpits and pubes (though plenty on my head/brows). I've always been this way. I am late 40s female white.I have several chronic health conditions acquired since my 30s; including early-onset osteoarthritis of the sacral spine and other joints, plus digestive issues.Thank you.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

By the time a person reaches age 70, says Walker, she's probably taking about 12 medications. The inability to take them unsupervised accounts for up to 40 percent of nursing home admissions. Fortunately, many devices available now can remind your parents to take their pills and keep them from getting their prescriptions scrambled. These range from pillboxes with alarms and timers to services that will send your parents medication reminders by phone, e-mail, or pager. MD.2, for example, is a monitored dispenser that you or a caregiver can load and refill, and your parents can dispense all their pills right on time, with one touch of a button. Rescue Alert will monitor your parents' pillbox electronically and alert a dispatcher if the lid isn't opened when it's supposed to be. Do an Internet search for medication reminder for a tour of the many options and find the one that's the best fit for your parents.

post_7190828	1583241	Help Deciphering MRI?	170	1287446	Aug 28, 2011	Hi everyone.    My father is an alzheimer's sufferer.    He abruptly began getting much worse in early 2009 and has since lost his ability to do about everything since.    He had an MRI on June 22, 2010 that I recently received a copy of, and I'm trying to decode the meaning.    Can anyone offer any help on this?        It says:MRI BRAIN WITHOUT CONTRASTCLINICAL STATEMENT:    Cerebellar ataxia.    Alzheimer's worsening symptoms.COMPARISON:    Prior MRI of the brain dated 3-18-05 is available for direct comparison.Findings:    The study is limited due to motion artifact throughout the examination.    The craniocervical junction is grossly unremarkable without crowding or narrowing at the level of the toramen magnum.    The corpus callosum is fully formed.    The ventricles and sulci are diffusely prominent, consistent with generalized volume loss.        Findings are not significantly changed.    There are patchy and confluent areas of subcortical and periventricular T2 FLAIR signal hyperintensity noted involving the bilateral cerebral hemispheres, not significantly changed and typical of chronic small vessel ischemic related changes.    Bilateral basal ganglia chronic lucanar intarctions are also present.    There is no restricted diffusion to suggest acute ischemia.    There are scattered areas of blooming artifact about the bilateral basal ganglia lacunes, consistent with chronic mineralization.    The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are aerated.	2	MRI,alzheimer's,dementia	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Hallucinations at first, now regulated with Risperidone, psychiatrist thinks its dementia. She keeps her upkeeing as much as possible but    unable to perform daily tasks. dressing, cooking, making coffee..cleaning, I help her in fact i do it. Im her only child. and im exhausted. she is very tired all the time low energy as she is a tiny person in size. i remind her about food. She takes antidepressant too which help. and vitamin B1, 12, 6.She bagun to wet the bed a few times. and is generally very low. She often says some pretty mad things. and when i say kichen she goes to the other direction. generally confused big time.i know i need to find home care. I take her to a day center three times a week now for Alz, where they do activities.I am wondering what stage of this are we in.    is it advanced, not, where am i? Can it happen so suddenly amd why? if so whats to follow. Does it level for a while or does it move at the same rate.could it be psudo dementia from deep depression. or am i being fooled.Thanks for hearing me and to anyone out there that either shares teh same or has the knoweledge about my questions.Thank you,	12	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_7229137	1591293	Heartbroken and concerned about my mother	170	280126	Sep 10, 2011	My mother who is 76 is in the end stage of alzheimers. She resides with my father who is her sole caregiver. My sister and I live 4 hours away in another state. My father has been telling us she is doing well and when we speak to her on the phone daily she seemed very confused but pretty good considering. My sister went home to visit two weeks ago and found that everything was not ok. Mom had not bathed nor taken her medicine for several days. She was refusing to do so. The house was covered in dust however no dirty dishes or clothes. My sister had my dad set an appt with a neuro (mom had been being treated by internist) who said she was in the end stage of the disease. I then rushed home and my sister left. My mom was in tears on the bed because my sister had cleaned the house. She was angry and crying and had not eaten. I calmed her down and fed her and she then collapsed, staring straight ahead, not blinking and drooling. She did not respond for about 5 minutes while we waited on the ambulance. At the hospital she had mri, cat scan, eeg, pet scan, xray, carotid artery scan, blood tests ect. The neuro said she had a seizure ( possible mini strokes) and to take keppra. She is on aricept. She was decent when I left her and a home health care nurse had come by to provide some assistance. My mom was upset and did not want them in the house. I calmed her or so I thought.    I left and returned home thinking all was calm when my sister called and said that dad had cancelled the nurse and could not get mom to go to her follow up appt with the neuro from being in the hopital for 24 hours. I am scared and do not know what to do.My father has always adored my mother and taken wonderful care of her. They have been married for 56 years and I do not know what is going on with him.

post_7213353	1588097	Am I being selfish?	170	1752783	Sep 05, 2011	Hi everyone,I wanted to get your opinions on my situation.    My grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's approxmately half a year ago.    Since then my siblings and I (I have one older brother and one older sister) have been visiting her at her house, taking her on outtings, and making sure she takes her meds, with my sister spending the most time with her. I am currently finishing my last semester in grad school and my schedule is a bit hectic with an internship and commuting, so I see her approximately 3 times a week.Growing up, my family life was filled with abuse and neglect on the part of my parents and some relatives.     I am not very close to my family (with the exceptions of my siblings) I have a very strained relationship with my parents (divorced), but am better off keeping it that way.    I have always wanted to move away from San Francisco and explore    I want to be able to start a new chapter of my life. My grandmother moved in with my siblings and I when I dad moved away when I was 10.    She took care of us, but still had emotional problems of her own that she took out on us, but I knew she loved us.Sorry to babble, but I just want to give you guys the background story.    My problem is that I want to move to New York in about half a year.     I currently live in San Francisco with my siblings and my dad. (I know it might seem odd that I live with my dad, consiering we barely speak, but I moved back home from college when I was 22 and have been in the rat race to make money and complete grad school ever since(I am not 26).    My goal has always been to leave this city and distance myself from a majority of my family, in hopes of being a happier person that i currently am.    At this time in my life, I would like to explore the world around me.    I have never been on a vacation, never left the country, and feel like it's high time that I live my life!    However, with my grandmothers diagnosis, I don't know what to do.    I have a feeling that my sister will become her primary caretaker (despite the fact that my dad and three uncles also live in the city, and visit her on a weekly basis).    I know how stressed and upset I feel when my grandmother is having a bad day (which is most of the time) and can imagine how my sister feels.    I don't know if my sister will resent me if I move away, I see her voluntarily taking on more responsibility.    She is not the type who would express her feelings, and she knows of my plans to move (she's known about it for years) and has not said anything about it.So, bottom line:    AM I BEING SELFISH?    I am open to your advice, and would appreciate constructive criticism.    Thanks!	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_7198650	1584981	Dementia ?	170	967168	Aug 31, 2011	2 years ago at the age of 42 I had a heart procedure done where my heart stopped 3 times and I suffered nerve damage throughout my body and what my dr thinks was oxygen loss and mild brain damage. I also have moderate obstructive sleep apnea and have loss of oxgen which I think makes the problem worse.Could that brain damage and oxygen deprivation cause dementia/alzeheimers? how do I tell?the past 2 years I've gone through periods of complete memory loss issues, forgetfulness, and "brain freezes" that leave me completely stumped...at first after surgery, I noticed little things wrong with my memory like not remembering my older children were from my first marriage or that I had been married before but the dr said that might be due to PTSD and the memories may come back.for example I know what words; are but forget what they mean or mix words up; like last week in my dr's office I told him I would sit in the table instead of chair; when I know full well what a table & chair are for and didn't even notice I said I would sit in a table until the dr looked at me weird and questioned me.another thing is when someone jokes as my husband often does, I don't know what it means any more and have to ask him to explain it all to me...I have problems sometimes even remembering my children's birthdays or how old they are...that should be easy, and I thought my husband and I had met when we were teens yet we didn't know each other or live in the same city and didn't meet until he was 29.I was shocked to find when I had a psych eval last month that I could not subtract numbers as I used to no matter how much I tried I only got 1 number right -    I mean 3rd grade math stuff subtracting 7 from 100 I got; but then i couldn't even remember what that number was or how to subtract 7 from that sum.In the past 2 years, I've had a ton of tests done to try and figure out what's going on healthwise.    The only thing besides electriacl issues with my heart; is I have inflammation throughout my body they can't find a cause of and I've had just about every blood test there is to check for most possible problems.any ideas?	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_7162344	1577058	HELP!!!	170	1219485	Aug 18, 2011	Hi.once again! I am going crazy dealing with my grandmother who has some form of dementia. She has been telling stories that are way out there & while I realize this is part of the disease I am trying to keep these stories under control so she doesn't tell them to other people.She is 87 yrs. old & refuses to have anyone live with her or to go into a home.She feels that there is nothing wrong with her even though home care comes in daily to give her Aricept-that is the norm to her.She doesn't bath,although she swears up and down she does & just her overall ability to take care of herself is gone.I have power of attorney & take care    of her bills, grocery shopping & such but on occasion she goes to the bank by taxi or whoever will take her & takes out stupid amounts of money which slowly disappears & then she tells others that I am stealing money from her. I'm sorry that this is all over the place but I am just about at whits end & I don't know what else to do or where or how to do it.Does anyone have any suggestions? Does it HAVE to go before the courts to be able to do anything?    Thanks for reading my rambelings & your time!

post_6958844	1532369	When to stop driving-please help	170	762700	Jun 03, 2011	My 83 year old mother was "sort of" diagnosed with Alzheimer's.    Her regular GP told her she had it and gave her a daily med.    She has been on it for about 3 years and she certainly seems to me to have Alzheimer's.    She lives with my father and he has started being with her almost all the time.    I don't feel like he is very honest with me about what is going on.    He tells me they have "interesting conversations" and she cannot cook any more because she burns food on the stove and in the microwave.    He says he is doing all the cooking.    I take them out to lunch once a week and talk to my Mom everyday, sometimes several times a day, and we get together for family things a lot,    Sometimes when I talk to her she doesn't make sense and then sometimes she seems normal.    She has a knee problem and is prone to falling and walks with a shuffle.    Over the winter my son and his wife needed to borrow a car so my Dad offered to let them have my Mom's car saying he could drive her every where.    I was relieved because I don't think she should drive anyway.    She had been limiting herself in the last few years and will only go a few palces, like the grocery and to her hair appointments.    After not driving for about 6 months she got her car back.    I don't think she should be driving at all.    Dad thinks she needs to stay active and she should drive...I am so worried she will have an accident, get lost, or hurt someone.    I don't know what to do.    I personally think she needs to see a neurologist or someone who specializes in this and get a good official diagnosis.    I worry everyday she will get behind the wheel and something very bad will happen.    Can anyone help me???	7	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

She wants to go back to her house even though she lives in her house, she pushes me and my mom. She hit me across the face because I blocked her way out. Because once she gets out we cant get her back in unless we lie and bribe her. She threatens to kill us and swears up and down that its not her house and we need to help her to get out. But as soon as the clock hits 8:30 maybe 9 pm. shes claim wants to go to bed and sometimes gets up and wants a cookie. But she knows that she is home. Her nurse said to me while I explained to her what was going on she said sounds like a case of sun downers syndrome. I have never heard of it, but when I looked it up it sounds just like it. She is on xanax to keep her claim and help her sleep but it doesn't take at all during 3pm to 9pm. Anyone know about sun downers?

Shes taking some kind of anxiety/ depression medicine for it. She would have little panic attack here and there, and we use to be able to get her to realize she is fine. Recently my aunt took over pills because my grandma thinks me and my mom do to much, its been about maybe 4 months since they have been in control of her and my grandpa's pills, they bring them when ever they feel like it and don't make sure they take them and you can see they don't care, But in the past months they have been taking care of my grandmother I have noticed shes more aggravated and more aggressive and shes a lot more upset and starts seeing people and having made up conversations in her mind and she worries to the point of panic and ended up in the hospital. I cant tell if maybe shes just getting worse of if maybe her meds aren't being regulated like they should be? I was just wondering if anyone knew is she just getting worse or could they possibly be neglecting my grandmother? They live alone,in the house I grew up in its on like a farm, and my grandpa is handicap in a wheel chair and has MS. Me and my mom are maybe 5 minutes at the least away from the house. So were really just a phone call away, but maybe its time for more help? Any answers are welcome....

post_6954646	1531479	Enlarged Cisterna magna detected during Congenital Anomaly scan	146	1699104	Jun 02, 2011	Hi,My name is Jade, I am 30 years old and is on my 32nd week of    pregnancy. This is my first pregnancy. I had my CAS on my 20th week and they found a choroid plexus cyst on the left part of the brain. My OB-Sonologist recommended that we do a follow up scan every 2 weeks to monitor the cyst. On my 30th week, the choroid plexus cyst was gone but she found that the baby has an enlarged cisterna magna instead in the left. There are no other anomalies found. I also underwent Biophysical Score for my baby and the same result was found - enlarged cisterna magna. I tried to check the internet what this means because this was not fully discussed by my OB-Gynecologist. I am now worried because most explanations I read about enlarged cisterna magna relates it to high risk of Trisomy 18, 13 and Hydrocephalus and a high risk of fetal mortality. Ultrasound result showed that I am conceiving a baby boy. I also had premature contractions recently so I had to be in complete bed rest.Can you please enlighten me about this. What are the chances that my child would survive, or would be normal?Thanks a lot.Worried mom,Jade	3	cisterna magna, enlarged,congenital anomaly,congenital,scan,Pregnancy,ultrasound	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

My wife is 18 1/2 weeks, and by the numbers, the data was saying we were really 19 1/2 weeks.Naturally, we are both confused and concerned.The doctor offered an amnio as an option because we have these two "soft markers."I know that the amnio will tell us for sure, but I just don't know what these two markers being present mean for the odds of Down syndrome.Does anyone have any experience they can share?	2	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7226837	1590787	What is wrong with me ?	146	1797227	Sep 09, 2011	Hi, I'm 28 years old but as you can see from my photo I look an awful lot younger. I have been told by a number of people that I only look 15/16 years old (from this photo) and I agree with this as I'm sure you will. I also can't grow any sort of proper beard. When I was 18 years old people told me I only looked 15 and they still do 10 years on so technically I've hardly aged.What makes it even worse is the fact I am 6' 3" tall (I've made sure you can't tell this from the photo) which makes me look like an overgrown child. My height and the fact I have an average build are the only reasons people think I'm older. I've never had a girlfriend, am still a virgin and people mock the way I look.Why do I have a child's face if I am so tall and generally, what could be wrong with me ?Any reply is greatly appreciated,D.	3	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7247635	3	Ehlers Danlos type 3	146	1485217	Sep 17, 2011	I was diagnosed w/EDS type 3 in 2002 @ age 29, after being misdiagnosed w/Fibromyalgia for over 5yrs. I've had numerous surgeries on my knees for dislocations, & finally they removed them both. I live in chronic pain, & have since around 1998, just not to the severity it is now. My question is that when I began to walk, I walked extremely pigeon toed & w/my rear up in the air, continue to walk that way. I cannot sit "Indian style", but rather w/my legs bent in a W position, w/the calves of my legs lying along side my outer thigh area. My mom says that when I began to walk & I was so obviously extremely, "in toeing", as she calls it, the pediatrician told her my hips hadn't properly rotated & to get me ASAP into sports which would help my feet straighten out. So I started skating & skiing @ 3!!My problem is my legs physically do not bend the normal way & my right hip causes me such pain, yet MRI only shows some sort of congenital fusion of a vertebrae into hip, which the Dr's tell me shouldn't be causing any pain. So should I #1 Had braces put on my legs to straighten as a kid?#2 Can anything be done now to straighten them?#3 Can anything be done about a congenital hip fusion to reduce pain?& lastly #4 Anything I can do about no longer having knee caps? Because I dealt w/constant dislocations of my left since 1988 & I'd pop it in myself. That was until it went all the way out to the side of my leg! The pain was horrific & even after a lateral release, screws inserted, & tendons/ligaments repair,    my knee cap still blew out after each one of those surgeries!! I was flat on my back on every pain pill you can think of for over 6+yrs & gained over 60lbs. And even now, I had my left one out in 2006, it hurts me every single moment of my life. I pray someday probably not in my lifetime, they find a cure for EDS, because it is one of the most severe, painful, debilitating,    yet unknown genetic disorder. If it wasn't for my husband & family I would be living in a cardboard box down by the river, as I was a senior in college when the knee/back/hip/& basically complete body meltdown occurred. I was physically unable, due to the pain in the majority of my body, to even get out of my bed & put my clothes on to drive out to college. Having EDS ruined my dreams & getting my diagnosis finding out there isn't a cure nor a treatment regime only deepened my depression. My Mom & Grandmother combined have to date almost hit the $200,000 mark on me, & I owe thousands for medical bills & things my wonderfully patient, hard working, husband of 6yrs paycheck just won't cover. I had to wear a thigh to ankle knee Immobilizer on my right kneeas I had my knee cap removed 3wks after my wedding! Yes I know a pretty sad story. But in actuality, many w/EDS are MUCH worse off than me. It would help TERMENDOUSLY if my state accepted EDS as a disability, but I also doubt that will occur in my lifetime. Also the number of misdiagnosed is HUGE which only makes matters worse. I only found out because my biological father was diagnosed after having a detached retina, which is a major symptom of EDS, & he tested positive thru a skin biopsy, & when he was told if he had a daughter she needed to be taken in for testing. My paternal Grandmother unfortunately passed away from EDS, & I wondered my entire life why she had contorted feet & hands & why she never worked, but rather spent her days in her recliner & slept in her own bed. All my questions were answered the day I was diagnosed.Thank you so very much! And please if just one person told another person about EDS, maybe our miserable genetic disorder could finally be recognized & someone could find a cure!!!JeniferLyn.

The Dr's say it is just constipation and prescribe Miralax which we have been on and off for years.    With the Miralax the fecal accidents can go up to 10 times a day.    He is very food restrictive and eats no more than 10 bland foods.    He has been tested for gluten allergies and it is negative.

post_7190608	1583176	GENETICS for facial hair	146	1779327	Aug 28, 2011	Hey y'all,I'm 18 years old and I have a question about facial hair. The thing is, I really want the potential of a thick, full grown beard. I started to look for products that could possibly enhance my facial hair growth. After doing a bit of research on the internet about facial hair and learned that there was no safe bet on any products that could enhance my hair growth capabilities. Testosterone, Rogaine, and other types of oils and such weren't the answer. In fact, I learned that the only major factor in facial hair growth was genetics, which is what brought me here in the first place.SO, that got me thinking... Well, my father is able to grow facial hair, so is my brother (only 2 1/2 years older than me). My brother was able to grow thick, full sideburns by the time he was 15/16. I am now 18 and STILL can't grow to the potential he can. He is now about to turn 21 and for the most part he can grow a full beard, besides his mustache which isn't nearly as thick as the rest of his facial hair. Maybe we have different levels of testosterone, I thought. He has always been an adrenaline junkie, the jock and all that. On the other hand, I've always been more settle, an artist you might say. Although I did play sports throughout my childhood years and up through high school. So does exercise and physical activity play a role? Does it increase your testosterone levels that also enhance your hair growth?Since we are brothers, born of the same mother and father, why does my brother have the ability to grow more facial hair than I do? Did he inherit more of the gene than I did? Is there any natural way to enhance my facial hair growth without putting my health to risk?Please help!

post_7094488	1562644	What could stimulate androgens in a fetus?	146	1747111	Jul 25, 2011	My Mother has had Rheumatoid Arthritis for over thirty years, and before she was pregnant with me she was convinced to go to Mexico to see doctors there that put her on a number of drugs.    One of which was cortisone.    It wasn√¢ Ä ôt until she got back and had me, she saw an internal medicines specialist and found out she was on 60 √¢ Ä ì 100 mg of cortisone a day. She was on this high level of cortisone throughout her entire pregnancy with me.    Cortisone is a corticosteroid and is closely related to Cortisol and other steroids such as Aldosterone.So my question is; what can a high dose of Cortisone do to a Fetus?    Could it take a genetically (XX) Female, that without any interference would develop fully as a girl, and cause it to develop as a fully functioning male?    Could it cause androgens to develop the wolffian ducts to be stimulated into growth rather than the Development of m√É ºllerian ducts?    Then the fetus develops into a male baby.My entire life I have felt like a female spirit trapped in a male body.    I am just trying to figure out why I feel the way I do.Please, any information or help you can give would be appreciated,	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6996340	1540634	Markers for DS	146	1711833	Jun 17, 2011	I am 26 years and pregnant with my 3rd child. I had no complications during my other pregnancies. When I went to the doctor for my screening ultrasound (18 weeks) and they found 2 choroid plexus cysts on each side of my sons brain. They suggested I go to a maternal fetal medicine doctor just to get it checked out. Told me that usually everything is fine and that its just a precaution because everything else looked fine. When I had my ultrasound at the specialist 2 days later they only located 1 CPC. (this one was small). After it was done the doctor informed me they found a couple things to be concerned about. #1. Absence of Nasal Bone. I don't understand why this would not have been noticed on earlier ultrasounds. I've had quiet a few. #2. Thickening of the nuchal fold. At 18 weeks my babies measurement was 6.5. The doctor told me that the cut off was 6. My chances were given to me based on these markers and my age to be 1:53. I'm still trying to decide if I am going to have the amnio or not. It won't change my mind on keeping my pregnancy but it will help me prepare for what could possibly be. Is it possible that they could have just missed the nasal bone? or that the thickening will thin out as the baby grows? I have so many questions and do not know where to turn.

Their respective map positions on this chromosome are: sht: 18mu vl: 29mu wx: 39muAn inversion involving chromosome 6 has been isolated. Its breakpoints are estimated to lie at 26mu and 43mu. Corn plants heterozygous for this inversion, as well as heterozygous for the three mutations, are crossed with a non-inverted line homozygous for the threemutations.Question 8. (3 marks/3 minutes)In cross 1, the expected phenotypes of the offspring will beA. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht,vl; sht,wx; vl,wx; sht; vl; and wx.B. wildtype; sht; vl; wx.C. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht; vl; wx.D. wildtype; sht,vl,wx; vl,wx; sht.E wildtype; sht,vl,wx; sht,vl; vl,wx.Question 9. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and vl isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12The following information is relevant for Questions 10 and 11In a second cross, corn heterozygous for the three mutations but now homozygous for the inversion are crossed with the non-inverted line homozygous for the three mutations. Calculate the expected recombination frequencies between the markers in the offspring.Question 10. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and vl isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12Question 11. (3 marks/3 minutes)The recombination frequency observed between sht and wx isA. 0B. 0.04C. 0.08D. 0.22E. 0.12AND! another one!In Drosophila two mutant phenotypes vestigial wings (vg) and ebony bodies (e) are autosomal recessive traits. The vg trait is on the second chromosome whereas the e trait is on the third. Males that were homozygous vg-, e- were mated to homozygous wildtype females. The males in this cross were also homozygous for a translocation between the second and third chromosomes. The vg and e loci were included on the translocated sections of the two chromosomes.The F1 males are then back-crossed to homozygous vg, e females.Question 22. 8 marks/8 minutesWhat is the expected phenotypic ratio in the F2?A 1 wild-type : 1 vg : 1 e : 1 vg,eB 1 wild-type : 1 vg, eC 2 wild-type : 1 vg: 1 eD 9 wild-type: 3 vg : 3 e : 1 vg,eE 9 wild-type : 3 vg : 4 eHope you can help	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_6914008	1522131	My Son	146	1688062	May 17, 2011	So, I have never posted anything like this before but I am at a loss. My 7 year old son is seeing many doctors who are trying to figure out what is wrong with him. He is 7 years old, he is not on the growth chart for height or weight. He has basically quit growing as of 17 months ago but his growth has slowed down over the years. As a baby he was in the 75th percentile. His left leg is clinically shorter than his right, he has PDD-NOS, he has a benign tumor removed from his eye last month, has surgery starting the 23 MAY for bilateral undescended testicles, the dentist confirmed that his adult teeth are behind at least by 3-4 years and is not sure if they are still forming, he is getting a biopsy on his penis for another growth similar to his eye. He has seen a Endocrine team at UNC and they said that he is producing the hormones to grow so there is nothing more they can do for him. He is scheduled to see a gentic doctor in July among other doctors. He has had over 50 appts in three months and I am so tired of hearing " We just do not know". They believe he has a syndrome but do not know what kind. Has anyone experienced anything like this?? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!	2	Genetics,endocrine,Short Stature,son	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

His sklin layers are too thin and his legs are all scarred up because of numerous gashes and stitches as a child and onward. He was diagnosed with this skin disorder as a child but can't remember the name and his mother only knew but she is deceased. He said it was a very long name that also was called "leathery skin" ,which doesn't make sense because leather is thick.Anyway, it seems to be inherited because he said an older relative of his had the same thing on his arms years ago. My concern is that my daughter seems to have the same symptoms. If she falls and scrapes any of her legs, it usually becomes an ER visit to get stitches. When we tell the doctors at the hospital and her pediatrican about this inherited disease, they don't have answers. They want to know what the name of the disease was and my husband can't remember.

After several rounds of iv iron and continued problems my hematologist ran this test and presented me with this diagnosis, gave me folic in high doses and went ahead and scheduled me for my next round of iv iron ,which I am having to replace more and more often.    It began at 2 yr intervals and we are now doing the iv iron every four months.    Needless to say I am not thrilled with this arrangement and am desperate to "just go back to being me without having to be *topped off*"    Rambling, sorry, so, I am thinking that if the HRT is working to reverse the side effects of menopause ... then why couldn't it reverse this process as well .. and has anyone tried??    Because, what doesn't seem to be discussed is how draining and exhausting the "depletion" process is when the iron, folic, and b's decide to tank ... and they do ... repeatedly.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

She told me once the arm cutting guy was in her closet, so I looked to show her he wasn't, and she told me he built an escape door in there and got out in the other room...I tried to show her there was no such door, but she got really mad at me.    she also call apartments to set up appts to go view them with the intention of moving out of the nursing home...I have gotten a call from one of them checking on her references!They give her seroquel, but it doesn't seem to touch the hallucinations.    she also has parkinsons and the parkinsons meds can cause hallucinations, but I am not sure they cause full blown movies 24/7.    She also has Hep C, so maybe her liver is starting to take a dive as well.i'm just not sure what to do, all i know is that she wants me to take her and all the kids she thinks live in the nursing home with no arms out so we can buy them coats for the winter.

post_7452928	1638125	Guradianship	170	193490	Nov 29, 2011	Hi, folks--Dad (now 86) diagnosed with probable vascular dementia 2 years ago this coming Feb. He's had 2 strokes the past 9 months (one major, one small); right CVAs. We've suspected for many years that he has bipolar disease and personality disorder, though these have not been confirmed (just started seeing psych person w/in past couple months, and given the whole picture, ferreting out what's what has not been feasible.) My Dad has never been one to really cooperate w/ family, now it's worse. He's in assisted living now; looks like I may have to go for guardianship due to increased behavior problems and his having no understanding of his abilities/challenges/need for assistance. Had    hoped to avoid legal action because he's so nasty already.In his "healthy" years, he frequently sued people, often far-fetched and found to be w/o merit. Dread this. Any suggestions from people that have been through similar situations would be really helpful--things you'd do differently if you knew what you know now? I have 2 sisters and they are not much help, sometimes more hindrance than just non-participatory.

post_7603881	1667539	My Grandpa	170	1920353	Jan 19, 2012	My grandpa was diagnosed with alzheimer's back in December when he was put in a nursing home after breaking his hip.I'm happy to report that, now, he's doing really good. Sometimes he thinks he's in the Old West---something he never lived, obviously, but a product of watching John Wayne movies, according to his doctor. He might be coming home by March if the physical therapy all goes well.If he gets to go home, it's going to be on us to take care of him and my grandma. She's too old to help him with the Stair Lift we had installed, or to do ALL the cooking and cleaning the way she used to. Plus, her eyes are too bad to drive. My uncle, aunt, parents, and myself (16 year old girl) are going to be helping out instead.I was wondering if someone could give me some information on what to expect with Alzheimer's in the future? He's in the early stages right now, so he still knows names, faces, all of those things. He just has his moments when he thinks he's in another time period, usually things that he's never been through. I wanna know what to look for, when to call the doctor, all of those kinds of things.Thanks so much!~ Em	2	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_7531344	1653777	overreaction to pain	170	1956850	Dec 27, 2011	Hello, my Mom and I live with and have been taking care of my Grandma who has dementia. She sleeps most of the day sitting in a recliner and often she wakes up completely startled and begins crying eventually.    She usually thinks someone told her she was bad and is being kicked out of her house but can't remember what she did. (No one has told her anything like this ) or she is thinking about her parents or sister who has passed away,    or she is worried that the animals are going to starve to death. Anyway,    when she thinks negatively it is accompanied by a constant feeling of being extremely cold (even when the house is roasting and she has a hot water bottle and blankets covering her),also she will start saying 'Ouch! Ouch!' and touching her fingertips saying that it feels like something is biting her or like electric shocks. Sometimes it is even going down her arms and in her armpits. My question is is this something that is related to the dementia? Is it normal or something else?    We have wondered sometimes if it is a heart problem but the doctors have looked at her arteries and seem to think everything is fine. Also electric shock is usually nerve related isn't it?	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

She is doing very well now, but she is still 78 and needs a break from stress and physical labor.My grandfather has COPD and has been having memory problems for the past year. He remembers the past with no problem, but he cannot remember upcoming dates or events, recent conversations, etc. now. His hearing is bad, too, but he is so stubborn and refuses to use a hearing aid. He also has been refusing to take his oxygen and nebulizer. He is a very stubborn man and does not respond kindly to things...he's very grumpy and always has been. Recently he has been meaner than usual, he is getting in a lot fights with my grandmom, and his legs have been failing him. He claims that it is because he is getting up too fast. Honestly, his day consists of getting up, walking to the couch, sleeping for an hour, walking to the dining room, sitting for 2 hours, walking to the couch, sleeping until dinner time, eating, and then sleeping until bedtime. He does very little physical activity and refuses to exercise or do ANYTHING.I am just so worried about my grandmother, because she doesn't need to be so stressed and worried. What can we do, as family, to help my grandfather? He is on depression medicine, Aricep (5mg)t, and various COPD meds. It is getting to the point now where he is falling whenever he tries to walk down a hallway. He holds onto anything he can grab while walking. I just am not buying the excuse that he is "getting up too fast." I think this is all related to his lack of oxygen from having COPD issues.Advice? :(	1	dementia,alzheimer,Depression,family,stress	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Well my memory and problem solving skills are not going back to were they use to be. I'm afraid i had a stroke which caused brain damage, or could this be an early onset dementia. I hope someone could give me advice Thanks.	3	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I get no sleep here as my father who has altzheimers constantly talks in his sleep and his voice resonates through the walls,he is always bitching and moaning about my being anywhere in the house thats not my bedroom,and i cannot take this. i got my grades back and i did horribly. and so i am now stuck here until i can get back my loans.which    at the rate of schoolwork i do,not being able to concentrate here at home i find myself begging and pleading with friends to let me stay so i can do work. and when i had my final paper due,i went a few towns away to go to a friends place thern had to deal with ehr screaming 4 year old! ,i got a B+ i needed an A to get loans back.what do i do so i dont end up failing out of my school?	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_7391327	1625109	early sign of dementia or drug interraction?	170	484508	Nov 08, 2011	First of all my biggest fear in the world is getting Alzheimers. So with that being said here is my query.I am not a big drinker at all. Maybe 4 glasses of wine a week, 2 at a setting. I also take Celexa 20 mg and Klonopin prn, but only use that whenever I have panic (every 14 days or so) The Celexa works.    I am 64, work full time, and for the most part I think my memory is pretty good.I went to dinner with some friends after taking a Klonopin .5 mg, and had 2 glasses of Merlot. I had a lovely time, A week later, I saw a guy in the diner who said hi, and he knew me. Said he had met me that night at dinner and we chatted, I pretended to know him because I did not want to appear rude or look odd/ I did ask him where he worked and he told me and I had a vague recognition of that topic.That scared the beJesus out of me. Should I be worried? Was that a blackout from mixing the two drugs, or is this a warning sign that I could be heading for dementia. My doc never mentioned not to have a drink when taking Klonopin. There is no dementia in my family by the way.	1	dementia,worried,klonopin	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_7409910	1629027	The doctor's say this is depression, but it sounds like dementia?	170	1895379	Nov 14, 2011	Hello, just looking for any advice or experiences anyone can offer.My dad is 57. For the past two years he has been on disability leave because he started having memory problems and depression. We discovered this when 1) he received a letter from a lady he had rear-ended while working out of town but he had forgotten it had ever happened, and 2) One night while talking to my mom on the phone he started slurring and stuttering his words as if he were having a stroke. When this happened he was put in the psychiatric ward at the hospital for depression for a week. He came out his normal self.Since then he has slowly become worse. He would forget whole days at a time, movies he has seen, and what day it is even when you've already told him several times. He started having balance problems and would stumble a lot. He also had sleeping problems as well as changes in personality. He can't drive. He has problems with numbers and measurements. There have been days and weeks he has been almost back to normal, but then the symptoms start happening again. The longest he's been "normal" has been about 4 weeks.This has been happening for two years but he wouldn't usually have all those symptoms at once. But over the past two weeks he has gotten really, really bad. He has fallen twice this week resulting in visits to the ER for stitches and a cat scan. There have been days lately where he slurs a lot and can hardly hold a conversation. He's also become really socially awkward... For example, my mom took him to McDonald's and he started yelling "I'm a pirate! Someone get me a sword!" in a pirate accent. He talks and sings loudly. His voice just sounds crazy most of the time, even when he's saying something that makes sense or having a coversation with you. He cries a lot because he'll realize every now and then that something is really wrong but he can't fix it. He has trouble walking, sleeping, talking. For the past week he's had blurred vision (double vision) and he was in the ER for that too. But they sent him home.He's been treated for depression this whole time and has been taking large doses of depression medication. He had a PET scan which came up negative for Frontal-temporal Dementia. He's had several MRIs and CT scans which have shown no signs of brain tumors or strokes.He goes to a neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist. The neurologist says he is 90% sure that all of these symptoms and problems are a result of severe depression and anxiety. He says it is not a stroke, tumor, or dementia or early-onset Alzheimer's.The psychiatrist and psychologist both believe it HAS to be something other than just depression to be causing the physical problems he is having.We are so, so frustrated and heart-broken to see him this way. My mom is trying to get him into a specialty hospital (like MAYO clinic) and see if those doctors can help.If it's depression, then we just don't know how to treat it. The medication he is taking doesn't seem to be doing anything, and the neurologist just says to keep upping his doses. At this point we are a little tired of this doctor and are trying (under his supervision) to wean my dad off of all his medication and see if that helps at all.I don't know where else to look. We are so worried and don't know what to do, so if this really is all depression I'm just trying to find out what I can to help him. If it's Alzheimer's of Dementia, we would at least like to know. My sweet dad is so scared right now, and so is his family.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and advice or opinions are welcome.	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_7576021	1662342	Is he about to die?	170	1979891	Jan 10, 2012	My grandfather is almost 87 years old. He's had Alzheimer's for about 8 years now. He's been in stage 7 for almost a year and a half, although the only criteria he doesn't meet is completely losing the ability to talk. (He can say 4-5 words at time, although most of it makes no sense). Last year he was in full renal failure from not eating, at which time my grandmother signed a DNI, DNR, and a living will. Some how he pulled through, but I think this is it now. 4 days ago he began freaking out more than usual, grunting and screaming and could not get comfortable. He's been wetting himself 4-5 times a day. Last night he was having trouble breathing, so they called 911. Today at the hospital they learned his heart has started beating irregularly, and he has a urinary tract infection that won't go away. He's a trooper, but I have a feeling he won't be coming out of the hospital this time. I live about 700 miles away from my entire extended family. Should I be planning (I'm a teacher) on going home for a funeral? What are your thoughts and/or experiences?	4	alzheimer's,Urinary tract infec,infections,Heart,atrial fibrillation,stage 7,end-stage	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

I did not permit them to have second jobs. They were paid over the minimum wage, and got two hour breaks, and paid lunches. That being said I prohibited internet. This turned into a major issue. But I straightened things out from day one. There was cable television in the room they could watch with the patient. Or even read while they sat next to her.    I did not want them spending their day e-mailing or surfing the net. They are paid to be a companion. Not to be a computer programmer.    One of the rules was than when she was awake I wanted them in view of her at all times, preferably at her side holding her hand or wrist. Not tapping on a keyboard. I mention this because I can tell you it will become an issue if you let the use of the internet get started. Just two cents worth.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_7665970	1679313	Handrails for the Elderly	221	144586	Feb 08, 2012	I was tasked with assisting two elderly people who had great difficulty walking and had an apartment that had long hallways. I installed wooden handrails, just like they have on stairs along the side of every wall, so they could hold on as they walked. Fortunately the wall was wooden halfway up (the home was old and classical), rather than plaster. The look was quite pleasing. The bare wood shape is purchased from a lumberyard by the foot, stained and polyurethaned, and attached with brass fittings. You tend to think of handrails only for stairs, but you can put them on any wall. You could also use the stainless steel bars sold for use in the bathroom, however there is an aesthetic issue. If the wall is plasterboard or plaster the fittings have to be screwed firmly to the wooden vertical supports. It's a simple project requiring no greater skill that knowing how to use a paintbrush, electric drill, screwdriver and hacksaw that will undoubtedly help prevent a fall.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_7672130	1680549	Wheelchairs	221	144586	Feb 10, 2012	This is a big topic and I will only say a few words at present. To begin with the so-called "rental" wheelchairs, provided by medicare/medicaid are totally unacceptable for taking a person outside. They have very hard non-resilient wheels, for one. They are designed for indoor use on smooth hard surfaces, such as in a nursing home.    The provider, who is usually a salesman, gives you what they have in stock. These salesman also usually have great bargains on bridges in Brooklyn. This is usually two types or sizes. The wheelchair rental racket is a scam. Just a personal opinion. Obtaining a custom comfortable wheelchair will be the best investment you could make.Purchase one. Even if the insurance pays for a rental you end up with a Faustian bargain. They never tell you that wheelchairs come in a number of sizes (amazing), heights, wheel types, and the push-handles come at varying heights above the ground.You ideally need two (count-em) wheelchairs. A small four-wheeled (small wheels) chair for inside the house, with brakes that can be set by the caregiver, and an out-door chair.    The foot activated brakes tend to be secured by bolts that loosen and then the health-care aid will vacuum them up and the chair won't have brakes. For some reason the brake supports seem difficult to order from the manufacturer if they fall off. There are several small pieces. . Tighten the bolts that secure the brakes when you get the chair, or better yet, apply some lock-tight to the bolts and re-tighten.    These may be Phillip's (the "x" kind) or tightened by an Allen wrench. The appropriate Allen wrench should run you about a dollar. When you roll the four-wheeled chair to a table, the brakes are set so it doesn't move away when the patient pushes on the table or moves while eating.An outdoor chair must have a soft tire. These tires come in two types. Inflatable (like bicycle wheels) and foam (semi-solid). If you want to see the difference have someone push you around for an hour in the streets in a hard-wheeled chair and then try the ones with resilient tires. In some cases resilient tires can be added to a rental wheelchair.You will also need a    foam cushion for the seat of both chairs. A thin cushion for the four-wheeled indoor chair and a thick one for the outdoor chair.    These are available at medical supply stores.Now you need the leg extensions, of course, but you need something else for the patient who is very elderly. You need to cut a plywood board about 24" long by 8: wide to go over the two foot rests. This is not always needed, but it prevents the infirm patient's legs from slipping between the leg extensions. A stroke patient may not be able to tell you and you won't notice you are twisting and damaging their feet. I used to secure this when going out with a length of duct tape, and later with a belt of velcro.Now you think about a velcro belt to keep the legs from slipping out. These are very inexpensive and locally available at the .99 cent stores for a buck. This should be very LOOSE, and simply prevent the patients legs from slipping forward over the edge of the plywood board or leg extensions.Finally, you need to obtain some scotch-light reflective tape (comes in red, striped and yellow) to wrap around cylindrical surfaces. At night this tape will pick up a headlight and insure visibility. They have little blinking strobes, but the Scotchlight (available at auto accessory stores) will work as well and less trouble.Of course you require an accessory bag to hook to the two handles that may be used for medicine, snacks, hydration (a small thermos), a blanket, cap, gloves, scarf, and most important a small flashlight. I prefer the fireman's disposable lights, but the new LEDS are super. I like to tape a cord to the flashlight and tie it to one of the straps on the accessory bag. Inventory this stuff before going out.	3	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_7556189	1658626	Securing Rugs	221	144586	Jan 04, 2012	One of the common problems in caring for an elderly person is to prevent them from tripping. Visiting nurse sent over a "mobility specialist" to an elderly person I know who then proceeded to secure the rugs to the wooden floor in the apartment with scotch-tape. After some comment, she returned the next day with duct tape.Arghhh!!! The appropriate tape to use to secure rugs to a floor is what is called "Gaffer Tape". This is available in various colors and up to six inches in width at photographic and motion picture supply stores, as well as on the internet. This tape is used in the motion picture industry to prevent people from tripping over cables and securing material temporarily. It is very strong, durable, and designed to be able to withstand someone walking over it. Most importantly, it can be REMOVED without damaging the floor. Duct-tape, no matter the brand, will leave adhesive that cannot be removed without destroying an expensive polyurethaned floor, for example. Gaffer tape can be used to tape an extension cord to the floor that provides power to an oxygen generator or other life-saving equipment. The down side is that gaffer tape is expensive, but well worth the money. It is a good idea to replace the tape every three months or so to prevent permanant attachment of particles adhesive, nevertheless. Gaffer tape is also useful in taping heavy equipment so it cannot fall (oxygen tanks, for example), or attaching a radio to smooth surface.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_7489234	1645404	young (ish) caregiver	221	1568238	Dec 11, 2011	Hi, I am 25 year old female, whom alongside my partner take care of his mother, my future mother in law.Mil is tetrapleagic, after contracting mrsa at one of our local hospitals. We have been looking after her for 3 and a half years now.She is confined to a wheelchair, and can't do much for herself though she is as sound as a pound mentaly.I myself, have a few health issues, as does my partner, we are not what you would classify as full time care givers as I work 5 days a week in accounts, aswell as for 6 months of the year attending college at weekends to obtain my accountancy qualification. My partner is self employed and can work up to 7 days a week.We have recently in the past 12 months noticed that his mum relys on us more more and more, physically that is not an issue, I change her cathetar bag, and make sure she has her meds on time, if she is ill I have time off of work, if she requires a nurse during the night we sit up with her, but we do seem to be fighting her battles for her more and more. She seems to just accept what the nhs tells her and doesn't fight for more help or the right medicationWe have carers come in 3 times a day to get her in and out of bed, morning and night, and some one at lunchtime to give her something to eat as me and my partner work.I guess I don't know what question I'm asking really, but just wondered if there was anyone else out there in a similar situation especially regarding the dependancy of 'fighting their battles'I would like to point out I don't begrudge doing this, but I can't understand why she won't say anything, potentially feeling vulnerable?! Anyway I don't know, ill stop babbling now lol!

Before this I was waking up virtually sightless in the eye -- it was as though there were no lens in the eye -- which would correct in a few hours.    Since the surgery I had been sleeping with the operated eye and that side of my face on the pillow and without eye protection since that my doctor said it didn't make any difference how I slept and I didn't need eye protection.    When I slept on my back the sightlessness on awakening disappeared, but as I say I now have ghost images.

post_7734803	1692642	Multiple low serum amino acids; multiple high urine organic acids	146	487668	Mar 02, 2012	My 6 year old daughter is being testing for a mitochondrial disorder.    She's had multiple health issues since birth and currently deals with low muscle tone, chronic intestinal pseudo obstruction, autonomic dysregulation, fatigue, poor vision, neuropathy and autistic traits.    She is feeding tube dependent through a GJ tube, and does occasionally eat by mouth.    She is cognitively normal.        When she becomes sick with anything, even a minor cold, all of her symptoms increase ten fold and we usually end up inpatient.    She always has odd basic metabolic labs, such as co2 getting lower even after being well hydrated with IV fluids.    Sugars sometimes drop during illness, especially if we lose the ability to feed her.    She was found to have a deletion in her microarray that is not concretely known to be associated with anything specific, though is often found as an autism loci.    Well amino acid panel and urine organic acids revealed nothing.    So our geneticist requested we do sick labs.    We've had two sets.    First set revealed dycarboxilic aciduria, but blood amino acids were normal.    The most recent set were done with a minor sinus thing and asthma flare but she acted much sicker than basic labs would have suggested.    The blood amino acid panel revealed 12 significant lows and a high plasma lactic acid.    The urine organic acid panel revealed 7 significant highs.    The day she was tested for these, we were sent home she was sick but holding her own and feeds were going at the usual rate.    During that night, her gastric drainage increased dramatically, and we were not able to keep up with her feeds and she was admitted.    Labs that day of admission revealed mildly low blood sugar of 60, low co2, elevated liver enzymes (not hugely elevated though) and a few other off things.    Fluids and gut rest for three days then restarting feeds and she was back to herself though weak.I know that often the blood amino acids are looked for to reveal high levels of amino acids.    I can't find any info on low levels, especially of several lows and how that relates to the high levels.    Both lab reports have been faxed to our geneticist, but it will be a few days before I hear from him I'm sure.    The blood panel reads "Suggests low protein intake (there is no way it's related to low protein intake as not sick these labs are normal), but multiple lows would suggest that urine organic acid testing be done to further investigate the potential for inborn errors of metabolism"    and then the urine organic acid talks about dycarboxlic aciduria along with the prescence of other elevated acids could indicate fatty acid oxidation disorders, diets of medium chain triglycerides and ketogenic disorders."She doesn't seem to fit the picture of any of those, especially to have gotten to her age without any cognitive issues.    But, I always assumed that with mitochondrial diseases, the levels would be high for both blood and urine.Any ideas how multiple lows play into metabolic issues?	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7659755	1678062	Perfect Human Subject for Medical Research	146	2020230	Feb 06, 2012	My question is: does anyone want to study myself to benefit the human race? I have only had a bug/virus once in my life back when I was 9 years old. Even when highly exposed to people with a bug/virus I do not pick them up. When I break a bone it only takes half the suggested time to heal. I do not brush my teeth yet they are white and have no fillings. I lose weight and gain muscle virtually overnight. I passed cognition tests with nearly all "Superior" results. I never get headaches. I have an attractive body which tans easily and my hair sun-bleaches. I am sexually active. I have great reflexes and am a champion marksman shooter. I am good at video games and very talented at music. I even have self-adjusting eyes (some times I'm short sighted, other times I can see for miles - when I focus in different ways in my mind it adjusts my vision). I can walk for 4 hours without stopping or getting tired, and this will increase with my fitness level. I have no diseases and am medically perfect in nearly every way.Please reply with what you are prepared to offer me in order to study me. I cannot disclose my contact details, but I reccommend trying variations of my username in different email hosts. Please do not remove this thread, as I believe I can contribute to helping the human race for disease prevention etc. Please note that I am being protected from wrong-doers.Thanks for reading this,Anonymous.	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7566650	1660600	Will we have a healthy baby despite our health conditions?	146	1974132	Jan 07, 2012	My husband and I want to have a baby real bad but there are a few things that are scaring us:1)When I was 18years I found out that I have a congenital anterior polar zonular cataract. I've had it all my life and it keeps increasing through the years.2)My husband has had asthma and recurring nasal polips all his life. He's had surgery in his nose many times ever since he was a little boy, but the polips just keep appearing.3)And the thing is..... we're second cousins. So this can be called inbreeding right? So if we had a baby, he/she could have genetic defects??....4) My parents were cousins too. So I was a result of inbreeding too... The doctors said that my cataract is a result of the fact that my parents shared the same blood. So, I know that genetic defects because of this is not a joke. I don't want my baby to go through any of this.My dad has had a retinal detatchment when he was 17 years old and has been blind in one eye ever since and the doctors said that that is hereditary too but luckily it skipped me but my children might have that.I've heard that the problems we have are all hereditary....and on top of that we're second cousins...What do you think are the chances that we could have healthy children?My parents are telling us not to have any children but to adopt because if by any chance the child is born with any defect, no matter how much we love him/her, the guilt will always be there.We really don't know what to do...	1	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7550484	1657553	Confused about my pregnancy and future	146	1690983	Jan 03, 2012	Hi I am sharing my story in this forum to see if I can get some help    as no one really knows why this is happening or what is happening. I miscarried last year in October at around 8 weeks after seeing no heart beat. Then I had one bio chemical pregnancy this year in June. I conceived again in November, my hcg levels were almost 10,000 at 4 weeks. We had our first scan at 6 weeks and could see the heart beat at 103 bpm, the technician said its low. Also, one of her observations was that the gestational sac is bigger than yolk sac by 2 weeks and is measuring 8 weeks. We did a follow up at 8 weeks and discovered that the heart beat dropped to 74 bpm and embryo was still measuring only 6 weeks which meant the growth stopped. My doc asked me to take hcg shot, start progesterone tablets, aspirin and also continue my frolic acid which I have been taking. She asked us to do a follow up in a week,s time which was on Dec 31. We went for a follow scan and found that the heart beat went up to 106 which I know is very low for 9 weeks and the embryo size corresponds to 6 weeks which mean no growth for last 3 weeks. Also, they saw 2 sacs this time and the technician said this is not normal so heart rate 106 bpm, 2 yolk sac like structures and 1 heart beat with no growth.they have asked us to wait for 10 more days and then go for D & C. I was really hopeful this time :-( last time also they could see 2 sac like structure out of that one was the yolk sac , no one knows about the other.My doc doubts if it has to do with some genetic abnormality. I am really puzzled as no one gives a clear answer and we have consulted 3 docs by nowPlease help if you have had any such experience or have heard of similar cases.

I went in for my formal U/S for the 2nd trimester and one of the babies heart has a calcified spot which is a soft marker for down syndrome.

I really don't know what I should do. I don't know anyone who has had an amnio done so I don't know who to ask.What do you guys think? My husband wants me to do an amnio because he doesn't want to have a chance of having a d/s baby because of the struggles he see's one of his cousins having. We have been trying to conceive for 3 years and after doing ivf 4x, it has finally worked and we are having twins and now we have to face a difficult decision of what to do.

I feel like there is some vein going from my neck to my    foot that is affected....because I get this weird pain in my achiles heel...sometimes my hip... and near my right shoulder that feels more like it has to do with nerves than OUCH type of pain...its a weakening type of pain but its not always there....sometimes the right side of my back gets a 'tingly' feeling. and I feel like when I use my back the only side I am aware of is the left...my right side isn't completly numb but to a degree its almost like its not being used which causes pain.I lifted weights while I had this problem and my right side just WOULD NOT match up to my left no matter how hard I tried and thats how I found out about this issue really.Sometimes I feel like the right side of my body is dying....its kind of an intuitive feeling...I can stile play basketball and lift weights and all that (which I dont because I feel like I need to rest all the time) I can walk normal and am still more athletically heatheir than your average person I would say...but Im a bit afraid of losing mobility...I am not afraid of death..I am afraid of living with a    big dissablility.ALL in ALL:Left side noticably bigger than right from my head to my private parts (I am male) to my feet.Slight numbness/weakness in right side of bodyPain in the achiles heal shoulder and hip on occassion.back paintingly feeling on right side of body ocassionallyjust an overall feeling of imbalance.Now, I am posting here to get as much advice I can for free...my issue right now is I CAN AFFORD A DOCTOR...I can afford a checkup thats about it but right now I am in Costa rica and I will have to drive 8 hrs to san jose to get a checkup and that costs alot.My main questions:What are the Do nots? what should I avoid at all costs?What can I do that doesn't involve going to a doctor that can help? (I love yoga and practice about 3 times a week or less due to this issue getting worse. I have lower back pain due to lifting weights and pulling my back (with a leg discrepancy) Also my right knee feels very weak and vulnerable while doing yoga..it easily hyper extends.How serious are the issues Im having and if I do not go to a doctor what are the risks?How can I get financal help with this problem? I need as much financial help as available.Thanks for taking your time to read this.P.S. I have alot of trouble sitting now because of the size difference of my hips.

I am now 9 weeks pregnant with my 3rd and my doctor for some reason tested me for the MTHFR mutation. And I was positive for a double copy of the A1298c mutation. He wants me to take extra folic acid, a baby asprin, and a neevo prenatal vitamin. But he also wants me to do Heparin shots 3 times a day for the entire pregnancy. I am fine with doing them if the are absolutely necessary.    I know that I am lucky to have no problems with my other two pregnancies and I could have an issue anytime since I have this mutation but Im worried of the unknown risks of taking this drug. I can not find enough info on the subject to make a safe decision. I am looking for opinions on what to do or whom to see for a 2nd opinion. I feel that the baby aspirin and prenatal should be enough, but I am not a medical expert.	1	MTHFR, mthfr mutation and pregnancy, genetic mutation, homozyous A1298c,mutation,A1298C	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I delivered vaginaly at 34 weeks and he was 3lbs although he could breath on his own he had bigger problems he had big bulging wide open fontanelles and his liver enzymes were trough the roof! After 2 biopsies they're still not sure what is wrong so he gets urso to help his liver function... He is seen by a genetics de and he is sure at 90% that this is a genetics disorder but he still cant find it! They also did a couple of MRI's and they told us sebastian has brain atrophy! I did a lot of research and wanted the dr's to check him for hydrocephalus because of his bulging fontanelles constant vomiting and really low muscle tone ( no coordination whatsoever) they did... A lumbar puncture and it came back ok... I just couldnt believe that so i pushed and pushed until they did another test i had the help of my ophtalmolpgist because sebastian was now having atrophy nerve in his eyes which led to some pressure in te brain! So they did another test and this one was directly in the brain... He was at 19 pressure and normaly it's at 10 so he had some pressure they did the shunt... He still has bulging fontanelles and they still didnt close ! His head circ is 56 cm and he weights 11kg 74 cmlong ... He is still vomiting like crazy and is tube fed i wonder if anyone knows what kind of a syndrome this can be? I am pregnant with my 2 one and am so scared :( i also think genetics somehow put us aside... normaly it's at 10 so he had some pressure they did the shunt...

I am newly wed, and my husband and I are looking to start a family.    He is in his early 30's and has just recently been diagnosed with bipolar.    He did not have the best of life growing up, very traumatic and not in a loving family household.    We both checked the family history and there is no known case going back 3 generations of Bipolar in his family.    In my family, there is not any either.    His doctor told him it is environmental factors from when he was growing up may have caused this illness to come out.

About 15 years ago she started to slowly loose the soft tissue in her body, her feet seem to be particularly bad as there is nothing but skin and bone and ligament there. The same with her hands. The most she's ever gotten with a diagnosis is fibromyalgia and shes been bounced to podiatrists and back doctors (forgot the word) like a ping pong ball for about 12 years. At this point I think her doctors pretty much given up trying to help her...I'm hoping that someone on here might recognize the symptoms. The largest seems to be the loss of soft tissue, the chronic pain, muscle atrophy(this may be due to the pain and lack of soft tissue on her feet making it difficult if not impossible for her to walk), weak immune system, nails on her feet are very thick and oddly shaped, she cannot produce her own tears and so needs lots of eyedrops, drinks lots of water and is still very dry, has constipation issues, and does not seem to absorb food very well.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7279170	1602006	Please Help!!!	146	1821712	Sep 28, 2011	My LMP was July 31st. I have normal 28 day cycles. Maybe a couple of times a year, 29-30 day cycles. Rarely does this occur. My period lasts from 3-4 days. Now, my question is.... I found out I was pregnant after my first missed MP didn't show on August 28th. I know I got pregnant on either August 9th (boyfriend) or August 11th (ex-boyfriend). Those are the only two dates I had sex. And, of course, I know I have to have a paternity test to be 100% sure. But, just for the sake of medical bills as of right now, which day is the most likely that I conceived?Additional DetailsJuly 31st was the FIRST day of my last period. I agree. I'm thinking more towards the ex since I should have ovulated around the 15th. My boyfriends' sperm should have been dead by then. Thanks to all for your opinions. And, I didn't CHEAT on my bf. We had broken up. We JUST recently reconciled AFTER he found out I was expecting. And, yes he does know it's a possibility it might not be his, As a matter of fact, I told him I'm 75/25 it's NOT. He's fine with that. People make mistakes. I slept with my ex unprotected. I know now the error of my ways.	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_8260335	1794421	new to Alzheimers - really Alz or diabetic dementia or???	170	1979418	Aug 22, 2012	Hi all,I've been on medhelp for quite some time on the wonderful MS support group.But recently we've gotten the shocking news that my mother may have Alzheimers and I am not nearly well educated on this, but feel its progressing so quickly, it may be related more to her diabetes being out of control.    She has lost 40 pounds in the last 6-8 months.    I was with her last week trying to get an emergency geriatric psych eval, but no luck.    Took her to the doctor she has seen for years and even tho the weight loss is akncolwedged, they were more concerned about more tests, then revisiting her meds.     I feel that her taking meds for diabetes, high blood pressure and congential heart failure for someone who was 40 lbs heavier is a huge mistake.She was not monitoring her sugars, nor taking her meds regularly, but once she came back up here with family, we started her on the med regimen as directed / orginally prescribed and started seeing her condition get drastically worse.    She had two episodes of sugars crashing, once to 21 and she was rushed to the hospital (where she remains) and then the following morning at the hospital, it was a 7 (yep that is a single digit).     They have removed her from all meds to let everything clear her system, but her dementia has gone from just forgetting a conversation 5 minutes ago to now seeing kids in the 'backyard' and them trying to break into the sliding screen door.    My brother is out on the front porch (outside her hospital door) talking to neighbors and sounds like kids are fighting int he street (hallway).    Even more terrifying to me, she thought it was 1975 and swore my dead brother had just left from visiting and she spoke to my father earlier (dad died in 1976).     She is also seeing cats everywhere (we recently had to surrender many of her cats, she was turning into the crazy cat lady with a shocking number of 16 in the house).     That was the trigger that made her flee WV with the cats in a van and drive to Baltimore.    We had the cats surrendered to a safe shelter, tho she thinks they got out of her van, doctors say to let her beleive they escaped, no need to confront her with a truth that will only agitate her worse.So, any thoughts....    does such a quick decline sound like anyone's experience with Alzheimer?     I know diabetes has its own mess of dementia and even bouncing around with meds can cause her to have paranoia behavior or see things.     But the doctors are leaning towards alzheimers and I just don't know enough to accept or fight that logic.    I always thought of Alzheimers as being a long slow painful process...    She is perfectly functional at moments, having conversations with me about events of the last week, then in the middle of it, she will start whispering that the boys are outside fussing with the windows again.Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.    I know no one here can say it's definitely this or that...    just looking for input on what experiences people here have had...     and as always on medhelp, looking to vent and know we're not alone dealing with this situation!!!Thank you for reading!!Jen	1	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

Her geriatrician stopped all her meds including those for Alzheimers to stabilize her liver. Once her Liver stabilized, the doctor introduced Risperdal stating that it is less liver antagonistic.I have read much about Risperdal being fatal to the    elderly but I have also read that given in low doses it is quite effective. My mother is currently in the hospital now for a week, and the Psychiatrist has increased the dose to 2 mg a day. He tells me that this is a low dose but I keep obsessing over the mortality issue. Aside from the Dementia, my mother is in decent health except for COPD, and does not require oxygen.Could someone shed some light on this subject, and the dosage, as it has created much anxiety for me despite her beginning to positively respond.	2	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_7973278	1739304	Visiting a Nursing Home - part one	221	144586	May 21, 2012	There are a few things to consider when visiting a severely debilitated friend or relative in a nursing home.(1) Make hand to shoulder or hand to wrist contact throughout the visit. Don't just stand near the end of the bed.(2) If you are thinking of things to bring, several soft fresh fruits - peaches, strawberries, bannanas (not hard) and not too many.(3) Think about bring as a gift an inexpensive chess set, checkers set or backgammon. There is a game room where the seniors can get these, but it often has limited hours, andf the number of sets are limited.(4) One of the re-current problems is that the seniors do not eat their food, and it is taken away after a short time. One of the reasons is that the kitchen help have to wash the dishes before the next meal. Having a supply of disposable containers to put food in to be enjoyed during the next hour after the meal is helpful. Do not bring washable plastic containers. They cannot be cleaned properly and will gum up the sink in the room. Obtain the small four-inch-by-four inch transparent salad containers (order on the net) and some plastic spoons and forks. And some hot-service cups for soups. The main entree, if not finished, can be placed in one of these containers and left on the tray over the patient. Then the staff can take asway the dishes for cleaning and sanitation. Do not put the food in a drawer. If it is not on the tray it should be thrown out.(5) Try to find a small battery-operated radio. Most homes have television, but not a radio. Many homes will ,object to a plug-in 115 volt radio that is kept on the bed.    You need a continuously tuned radio, preferably AM-FM with a rotating knob for tuning. The digital radios cannot be operated by the frail and stroke disabled. I am not a happy camper with the ear-plugs, which become lost rapidly. If the volume is kept low the radio can be placed on a pillow next to the ear. Talk-shows and easy-listening music are good ways to full up the empty hours. And, of course bring extra batteries.(6) Usually there are two to a room in nursing homes. Often one patient can walk while the other (your patient) is bedridden. If your mom or dad is very debilitated and the other person is not ask them to assist when you are not there. One of the biggest problems is hydration. The patient does not drink enough. You can ask them to continually offer small cups of juice or water to your bedridden loved one throuighout the day. The CNA's do not pay enough attention to this.(7) If there are two pair of eyeglasses make sure the ones for reading have different frames or are marked with tape. Usually nursing homes will provide eyeglasses for near and far, but will mount them in identical frames.(8) Think about obtaining large-print newspapers or reading material.(9) Talk to the CNA's and compliment them. In the summer bring them a dozen cans of ice-cold soda to the nursing station. Or a box of jelly donuts.    In winter order a large pizza for the staff. Monetary tips are inappropriate.(10) Bring some fresh-squeezed juice or your choise and some small plastic cups to share.(11) If you have to take a break while the staff cleans your loved one go down the hall and talk to the other patients. You will find many have not had visitors for months. Always ask the CNA if you can give them food or drink. Many have swallowing problems.(12) If there is an outdoor area where you can take your patient, ask the CNA for permission to do so whenever you visit in good weather. Avoid sunburn.(13) Try to spend a reasonable amount of time sitting next to the patient and holding their hand or wrist.(14)    Ask the patient what he/she would like you to bring for a treat next time. (i.e - fresh strawberries)(15) If you say you are going to visit on a certain day do not miss the day.(16) Tell the patient what the weather is outside, the time, the day and the year (if they are very debilitated). Mention a single big event of the day to taslk abouit that is not too controversial (sports, for example).(17) Find out the names of the CNA's and nurses that work the stations. And the physician, psychiatrist, physical therapist and nursing home administrator.    Do this quietly. Many re reluctant to provide this information.(18) If the patient is very debilitated perform some simple range-of-motion exercises with their hands and arms. There is never enough of this done.(19) avoid complaining to the staff unless absolutely necessary.(20) Do not ask the staff about the patient's medications or attempt to read the nurses notes. This always causes an issue. Although you may have a right to this it places the low level staff in a difficult position because they have been ordered to maintain patient privacy. If necessary make a specific appointment with the nursing home physician with your health care proxy to discuss these issues.	6	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_8289159	1799965	Am I in for a hard path to 'placement'???	221	3222955	Aug 31, 2012	I will try to keep this as short as possible... Then answer whatever is asked of me thereafter.Long story short, my stepfathers history, summorized(he's the one who would need placement);1. 30 Years of Type 2 Diabetes that's resulted in 'Extreme' Diabetic Neuropathy in the legs/Muscle Waste2. Severe Spinal Stenosis that has resulted in doubling the trouble with use of legs/DRAMATICALLY increasing the risk of falls/dramatically increasing frequency of urination, up to 25 times in a 24 hour period--12 times during the night, will not wear a catheter.. This is a HUGE burden on my mother and I(which is really 1.5 people caring for his needs, as my mother is 79 and can't help him up, etc.)3. Open heart w/Aortic Valve Replacement and triple bypass in Nov., 2011./He was blacking out, given til Christmas, 2011, to live if he didn't do the surgery.4. Moderately onset Dementia(believe it's vascular, comes and goes, but most times is fairly bad)5. Can barely communicate any longer(knows what he wants to say at times, but it comes out as, "I, I, I, I, I, I," for around 5 minutes, often doesn't come to an answer without lots of fishing/providing 'possibles' for him and is often something like "I, I, I, I"-1 MINUTE REPETITION-"need...10 dollars for a haircut"... usually he's trying to exclaim how painful his legs are or "i want to go to bed" or "I want to go to the doctor so he can fix my legs", Etc.6. He's often VERY mean to me and especially to my mother, 79 and also in 'fairly' risky health as well, due to having had a larger stroke and recovered ok, but A-fib and being overweight, etc., as well. He accuses her of sleeping with me and my nephew or whomever she is going out to see/whomever gives her a hug or basically pulls her away from the couch/by his side.I am not overstating when I say that this man is and always has been a HUGE 'narcissist', very self centered and often VERY mean/verbally abusive.Bottom line, I can't manage this care any longer between the two of us... And we are wanting the "Medical" system to get involved.(As I understand it, Medicare will use up it's 90Days and then Medical will kick in, under VERY specific conditions)..... As I said, and should have restated... "He needs to be placed in a 24 hour care facility." His children are seemingly only interested in the Will and such, and while his son lives 4 miles away, he's been over here for a total of 3 hours in 6 visits, since December, 2011, when my stepfather returned home.My stepfather's PC Physician, Neurologist and new, the other day visit from a Psychologist, all feel that he is BEYOND ready for placement(Two of them saying, "Not sure why it would be impossible to catigorize him as 'medically needing placement', Mental/Physical and risk of injury being the calls"...). When I told them I've been doing this, either directly or on call/live in, for 8 months, 18 hours a day(I have to stay up til 5;30AM or so when My mother wakes to help him to the toilet, otherwise tie him down which would be even more unmanageable), 7 days a week... They all have dropped their jaws and said, "Mark,.....this is way too much, you're going to end up very ill if you continue this way".... I AGREE, but my problem is not only myself... I am VERY concerned for my mother..... This is QUICKLY wearing her down to the point of total exhaustion and to where she's passing out throughout the day on the couch, just overwhelmed, etc. I can't allow it to go on... And, to my point.........I DO NOT think, from what I've read/been told by others who've been in my situation.... that Medicare or Medical are going to want to provide "in home care"...... Even if they did, it would likely be a few hours a week that we would share the burden of, obviously, under the laws/policies. A few hours a week is not enough....I NEED to get back to 'living my life', and to be honest, can't take any more, emotionally or physically. I'm a Certified Executive Chef, and over the last couple years, I've sacrificed everything, including my career and most of my savings... And in reality, I'm now in Debt! In my understanding, we have to be down to 3K dollars in my mother and husbands accounts? They have annuities, but not enough that it would last past maybe a year or two of in home care co-payment. Not forgetting to mention, they would also be attaching ALL of his Social Security... That would leave only the interest on their annuities to live off of for my mother, paying all the house bills/property taxes, etc.We were told that there are ways to legally prevent them from touching things like annuities, and the house is under a reverse mortgage with NOTHING left of the 'credit line'.... We are meeting with the 'finacial guru's' in our life, over the next week, whom deal with elderly finance, etc.... But we really don't have anyone to represent/guide us through the 'placement requirements', if we can even get them funded by Medical... So I would just REALLY DROP TO MY KNEES in gratitude for any advice on ................."The best path to ensure that we can get him placed in assisted living".	10	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8288599	1799843	Hospitals, Aides, and fall prevention	221	144586	Aug 31, 2012	I have been involved with a number of very elderly stroke-disabled patients and have found that the hospitals are not set up to deal with them - even those with geriatric wards. The problem is strange surroundings, a very elderly stroke-disabled patient, and a high bed and a hard floor. When agitated, especially at night, they may climb over the bed rails and fall to the floor and injure themselves.    Because of hospital policy they generally will not use restraints, and if they do they will use wrist restraints which cause the patient to become extremely upset. The answer is to have someone in the room with them, especially at night. This person does not have to be a nurse or have any certification other than common sense. Insurance does not always cover such a situation. Ideally a relative should stay, but this is not always possible. What I have done is to hire female college students to sit overnight in the room. I set this up ahead of time and have several names to call on a contingency basis. I got the names by placing an ad on a card on the bulleten board of a nursing school at the beginning of a semester. If there is a problem they can use the call bell to summon a nurse. In the United States, if you are paying cash, this can be done very inexpensively. If you go through the hospital you will most likely find yourself billed for the services of either a registered nurse.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_8286671	1799501	Vasovagal Fainting - Foam floor panels	221	144586	Aug 30, 2012	If you are supervising for or caring for an elderly person, one of the most common "emergencies" is vasovagal fainting. It can be very frightening to the caregiver. The co-factor is constipation and dehydration. The problem is the vagus nerve which meanders though the body and passes close to the anal sphincter. It is a very big nerve, the size of your pinky in places.    When over-stimulated by straining this drops the heart rate by from 20-40 beats per second. This is the reason many heart-attack victims are found dead on the toilet. It is the reason that the elderly, and in particular the stroke-disabled and feeble, must NEVER be left alone on the toilet. It is a good idea to schedule toilet visits (a) at the same exact time every day and (b) either immediately before meals or an hour afterwards. The reason for the meal interlude is that vomiting and airway compromise after fainting are sometimes a problem. You want a clear tummy. These vasovagal fainting episodes may cause simple woosiness or complete loss of consciousness. Generally the loss of consciousness is not long. Between ten seconds and a minute. The treatment drill is to immediately ease the patient to the floor, feet elevated from seven to ten inches, and a slight pad placed under the shoulder blades. Recovery should be within a minute or two and full recovery after fifteen minutes to an hour. Keep them on the floor and hold their hands or shoulder (providing reassurance) and check for good breathing and a pulse. The pulse will be bradycardic. That is under fifty beats, generally about forty. Don't worry. And don't worry about feces, urine or clearing up until they have completely recovered. The important thing is to stay with them. Not to run to call 911. If there is no regaining consciousness or if there is a breathing problem of the heart stops, of course call 911. Do not put them on the toilet again until they have been well-hydrated. As much fluid as they can take within six hours. Plus a stool softener. Consider using a fleet enema. A big problem is if the patients topples from the toilet. I found that placing interlocking foam squares around the portable toilet will cushion any possible fall. There are great to place around the bed also. They come in ordinary colors and bright ones. They are water resistant. I use them a lot. If they are on a wood or tiled surface use tape that is stick on both sides to secure them to the floor to prevent sliding. They can be assembled in all patterns.A problem with hired caregivers is that because they have little training they panic and either call 911 or their supervisor (leaving the patient on the floor). An ambulance is then called. The medics gets the callas an unconscious and the drill begins....sigh.I was with my little one (she was 102 at the time - she is now 108) and I left the apartment to take a walk and get coffee and spend time with the new blond waitress in the restaurant down the block from Germany who spoke little english and looked like Sandra Bullock. Yes dreams that she would take pity on an old man, and teach me all she knew about German massage.She was with a new aide - a replacement from the agency who spoke no known language.In any event I get no call on the cell and arrive back at the farm to see an ambulance racing off in the distance. Hmmm. I had sixty-three cents in my pocket. Not enough for a cab, I used the cell and the aide tells me (partly with sign language and mime) that my little one collapsed on the toilet.Arghhh. A vasovagal fainting episode.After a mile hike to the hospital I find my little one with four blown veins (all the good she had) while an interns is attempting an arterial blood gas draw!    Lots of tubes of blood to cover insurance regulations. They just finished five unnecessary x-rays because they thought "she may have hit her head and had a concussion".    She fell on my foam panels. And the aide was not holding her hand but left her alone while she gabbed on her cell-phone to her boyfriend. (I think that was aide eighteen of the thirty-seven I fired)    Worse they are talking about a cut-down! The two overweight paramedics are there smiling with their four-cell metal flashlights on their hips and seven patches on each arm certifying expertise in underwater CPR, arctic rescue, scuba-diving, and radiation hazard training. Nobody in the room is holding sweety-pies hand or shoulder. A young doctor is busy entering data in his laptop. And this is in a so-called "top" ER. A doctor is about to administer Haldol to my little one because she is screaming and restless!At that point I slapped the syringe from his hand and stepped on, and gave him a story about what happens in Sicily to doctors who mistreat elderly women. I disremember the rest of the conversation, but there were various allegations leading me to be removed from the hospital in handcuffs. There was NO Haldol administered. I returned with my attorney (who owed me big because I introduced him to his main squeeze) and who had an office a block away and we engaged in he-said-she said. Meanwhile sweety pie has been admitted because the hospital regs state overlnght stays for loss of consciousness. All over simple fainting. I called in another aide she knew who held her hand while I thought things over. Finally I came back at midnight, told them I was her son (I fibbed but had my fingers cross behind my back so it didn't count), and signed her out against medical advice, and brought her to the park where we held hands under the summer moon and had a hot chocolate party. She was happy and smiling, and we went home, watched cartoons and she had hot chicken soup at three A.M. and went to bed.And lived happily every after.Anyways, that's my vasovagal fainting story.But the foam panels are a worthwhile addition to the accessories necessary to be a good caregiver.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_8140713	911	911 Protocol for Health Aides	221	144586	Jul 14, 2012	If you hire a health care aide do not assume they will be able to handle a 911 call. What I do is to run every one of them (whew!) through a "scenario". That is to say a "mock" 911 call, making believe I am the 911 operator. Surprisingly, many fail this simple exercise. In the patient's room I have a loose-leaf book labeled: "Rules of the Road". The protocols for various emergencies and contingencies are spelled out clearly in this book. The most important rule I teach is NOT to call "security" in the building or "their nursing supervisor". If you hire aides from an agency mark my words. They will call their agency supervisor for instructions BEFORE calling 911 unless you straighten this out from square one. This week a woman aide I know smelled smoke. Instead of calling 911 she called building security to come up and investigate. She was lucky. It was a neighbor burning food. She did the wrong thing. These fellows get paid to make-nice with the siren and the lights.NEVER HESITATE TO ROLL THOSE ENGINES!To make this easy I have created a print-out for your computer. It is important to note I have included a sentence "I am located in ________town (or borough". Many lives are lost because emergency equipment is sent to a similar address in an adjoining district. In New York City there is a Broadway in all five boroughs, for example. The other worthwhile bit of information is "the nearest intersecting street". By the same token make sure there is a NUMBER in front of the house or building and a NUMBER or LETTER on the door.I am not a happy camper with the various services that rent a button that connects them with their operator, who then calls 911. In the first grade we used to play something called "telephone". One child gets a message and whispers it to the child behind and you go around the room. Information is lost and distorted with every repetition. It is bad enough that in some cities when you want to report a fire you first tell your story to a screener, who then decides to have the information sent to a fire dispatcher, where it must be repeated. It is best to call 911 directly.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

Over the years I received many answers, but never the correct one. Some girls told me "to keep the house clean". Others said "to make sure Mrs.______takes her medications". Still others said "to make sure Mrs. eats and drinks and to call the doctor if anything happens." I would have to straighten them out.Your PRIMARY DUTY, I would tell them,is to try to make sure that when you come in to work, you do your everything in your power to make that this will be the very BEST and HAPPIEST day of your patient's life.I would meet with them personally every day, or if that was impossible, by telephone and we would discuss exactly how we planned to accomplish that goal.	6	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8125152	1768278	Keeping Track of Hydration in The Elderly	221	144586	Jul 09, 2012	Caregiver222 has developed a system for insuring the elderly are properly hydrated. It is extremely important to make sure the elderly keep properly hydrated and in most places this is done by "guestimate".    Some nursing homes use astrology. Others use the Vulcan mind meld. I suggest there is a better way.    In most all facilities the aids arrive with a cup and straw or glass filled with a single flavor of drink. The system entails purchase of small plastic cups, in either a two-ounce or three-ounce size. You don't serve liquids in glasses.    The second part of the system is NEVER to serve only a single flavor of beverage. At meals I follow the "four-flavor" rule. Four cups containing four different flavors of beverage. Orange, banana, milk, water.    Chocolate milk, pineapple juice, tomato juice, iced tea. You get the idea. My little one always wanted at least one cup of plain old water. At snack time I change this to the two-flavor rule.    I like contrasting flavors of beverage. Orange juice and chocolate milk (in separate two-once servings) were a special hit.    The small quantities ensure that if the drink is not used expensive ensure or juice will not be wasted, and if there is a spill there will not be a great mess. Elderly patients satiate quite readily on a single flavor of beverage. As the cups are emptied they are stacked near the patient. At the end of the day the empty cups are counted and an exact measure of daily hydration is available. All patients should have a small permanently bound book by their side in which the aids make notations. I use the inexpensive marble grade-school notebooks. And every day is kept a written record of hydration.	5	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

I bought it in a bicycle store. When going down the sidewalk and obstructed by a crowd she would delight in beeping our way through! This didn't go over as well in the hospital hallway when there a line for the elevator, however. In any event, the little horn gave her some control over things and provided her with some fun.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8120953	1767469	Monitering Food Intake	221	144586	Jul 08, 2012	It is very important for the enfeebled to take in enough calories and nutrients. With age comes dysphagia and little appetite. I set up a daily log and pre-prepared breakfast, lunch and dinner relying on aids to report what was eaten. Foolish me. Day after day I would see in the log: "Lunch. She eat Good!". "Breakfast. She ate great!". Then I started going through the trash bags. The meals were hardly touched. The aides, I found, had a tendency to fib. In fact their noses were longer than Pinnochio.    I placed a recording video camera over the meal area. This caused a unbelievable number of complaints. The aides refused to feed under the camera! Squalk, squalk! Oh well. I'm easy. Out went the recording camera. I then started a new program. The remains of every meal would not be thrown out but placed in the refrigerator. I would then throw the food out at the end of the day after inspecting the plates. This worked out well. It enabled me to see what foods were liked and disliked and also to insure that the aids spent more time feeding and allowed a longer interval between spoonfulls.    This takes patience. And it won't take place unless there is supervision.    It is very easy for an elderly person to slowly lose weight, especially if there is not a scale to weigh them on a weekly basis. It is important to main both a hydration log and a log of the quantity of food eaten.	4	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8121524	1767574	Certificates of Necessity	221	144586	Jul 08, 2012	If you are involved in the care of an elderly person on Medicaid or Medicare you have to learn about so-called "certificates of necessity". You can get all kinds of discounted stuff (durable medical supplies) with such certificates. To find out exactly what, look up "Coverage Issues Manual" on the net and you will see about 600 items listed. Look this catalog over. Within reason, a physician will generally approve what you ask for. In order for the certificate to be issued there must be a face-to-face meeting with the patient. You can't get one on the telephone. Generally, there is a co-pay of about 20%. Some hard lessons I have learned is to obtain the certificate of necessity and then YOU select the equipment. What usually happens is that a "care coordinator" affiliated with the home-care service does this, and they all get kick-backs. If you get a certificate for a motorized wheelchair, for example, you have the choice of a dozen models and manufacturers.    Furthermore many items come in various sizes and colors. One can get electric chairs that enables someone to go from a sitting to a standing position from many manufacturers in many styles, colors and sizes. Don't let the care supervisor make this selection. You end up with a less than optimal wheelchair or chair from a manufacturer that gives them the best kickback. I was involved years ago in a great investigation of these kickbacks and I can assure you they exist. Don't let someone else make that choice. The other fact that isn't told is that you have a rent or buy option. In almost every case where the item is to be used for more than two years you are better off buying. The certificates have to be signed my a medicare enrolled physician or certified person. Not any physician can do so. Bear in mind that a window of opportunity exists formany items. For example, a motorized wheelchair may be approved for someone living at home, however as soon as they go to assisted living they may not get a certificate. So it pays to get the motorized wheelchair before entering such a facility.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8120783	1767428	Oxygen Danger and Petroleum Products	221	144586	Jul 08, 2012	Oxygen will spontaneously ignite when coming into contact with oil or vaseline. While everyone is familiar with the "no smoking" rule, not all know about the "no petroleum product rule". This is what is called a hypergolic reaction. No flame or heat is necessary. The problem becomes serious when a patient at home on an oxygen cannula complains to his/her health care aid, who may speak no known language and apparently obtained her certification by sending in boxtops, shows up with vaseline to place in the nostrils to make her charge "more comfortable". I have actually seen this happen and fortunately was able to prevent it from happening. If a patient uses oxygen,    vaseline or oil based products should NEVER be used on their lips or face. If you have a loved one on oxygen this fact must be conveyed to every aid that comes in to assist her, without exception. I place this warning in writing in a document called "rules of the road" that every aid must sign at the time they begin to work.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8119211	1767095	Modeling Clay for Elderly Rehab	221	144586	Jul 07, 2012	I started caring for a woman named Inez when she was 99, and paralyzed from a stroke. Initially she had difficulty in moving her hands to feed herself. One of my goals was to get her to start using her hands and arms and to strengthen them. One of the structured activities I developed was the use of soft colored modeling clay. The sessions worked best when they were at the same time and for no longer than thirty minutes. I made some cute animals (copying ones I saw on the internet because I wasn't that creative)    up and then rolled the clay soft and let her take a try. When she made an animal I would clay and express delight and we would place it on display. It is difficult to find activities that both encourage use of hands and coordination and can be experienced and be fun to someone who can hardly move. The clay could also be brought into a nursing home, and be part of a visit. I would not leave it around (except for any animals made) because the homes do not approve of "mess". I have had trouble leaving art supplies that included paint, for example, having been told those activities could only take place in the recreation room. With the clay, you could enjoy a time with a bedridden patient using the tray that they eat their meals off of.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8118858	1767022	Dry Erase Boards for Communication	221	144586	Jul 07, 2012	Dry erase boards are wonderful for communication with the stroke-disabled elderly, especially those with hearing problems and speech disorders. Many stroke-disabled elderly are very frustrated because people do not communicate with them. I have used them with people who could only move one hand. You can ask a question and write (Squeeze my hand once is yes. Twice is no.) When my mother passed she was a quadraplegic who could only move one finger and because of a tracheotomy could not talk, but could answer questions with the dry-erase board by moving her one finger to touch my hand or blink her eyes.    I am still crying about the loss of one of those I took under my wing this month (Claudine), however another (Inez) is 108 years old and going strong. If you have aids they have to be instructed to use the dry erase boards frequently or they will not. The dry erase boards are useful in encouraging decision making on the part of the patient. I like to give three choices. For example "Want to go out to te park? Underneath I print, "Yes", "no", or "later". By the same token don't just bring a beverage. Write on the board: "Want orange or tomato?"    Use the boards to enable menu selection: "Do you want fish or pasta" "pea soup or chicken noodle soup?"The boards are especially useful in diagnosing medical problems or discomfort. "Is the pain in the left arm?" ("yes" or "no"). Is the pain "very bad" or "not so bad". Or you can use the old one to ten system of describing the intensity of pain. Without use of the dry erase board it is virtually impossible to make a differential diagnosis. In the morning have the aid write the date and if something special is happening. For example: "The foot doctor is coming today." If you have an aid when you come in inspect the board to insure is is being used that day for communications. Make sure the writing is in bold two-inch high clearly formed printed form. This fact may seem obvious, but is is not. Say nothing and the aids will communicate with script or poorly formed letters or half-inch high letters. Arghh. Common sense, apparently, is not all that common. You need two boards. One for the room and another small one to tuck into the carry bag on the wheelchair. And of course non-toxic pens in bold colors, preferably the large ones. Inez used to like to try her hand at drawing on the board and I used it for rehabilitative hand therapy. I had to place the marker in her hand and she could only make lines with difficulty. The boards and markers are very inexpensive and available a many stores. Staples always seems to have a good selection.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

I have been using this handle for many years, professionally, in songwriting and in writing, and the "222" comes from the hospital room where a loved one died. This particular site has paid advertisements by nursing homes, some of which are the subject of numerous federal deficiency complaints involving the deaths of patients. They have essentially lifted my identity as caregiver222 to endorse these questionable homes, have admitted they have done so, and essentially said "sue us". If this was 1814 caregiver222 would be happy to settle the question the way President Jackson settled his problems, but I am law-abiding and moral, and my PTSD from Vietnam these days is under control. In any event, since I have received messages regarding endorsing these homes from people on Medhelp I wish to state that such postings, using the handle"caregiver222" are fraudulent, ficticious and unethical.	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_7936341	1731857	Importance of Decision Making	221	144586	May 08, 2012	With the super-elderly and severely disabled elderly (especially the bedridden) the structured provision of means for them    to make decisions is extremely important. If you have health care aides, this must be emphasized. As an example of this is to always offer two choices of some activity, several times a day. This takes some thought.    In senior homes, residents often dump their meals into plastic bags (not eating in the dining room) to take them to their rooms because choosing the time of day they can eat is important.(1) In the morning the patient should be offered a choice of TWO kinds of clothing. I am not a fan of leaving patients in pajamas all day long. They should be dressed in normal clothing during the daytime.(2) If they go outside a choice of hats and handbags and earings (for example). Two choices are enough.(3) With meals, offer them a choice of entrees every day. ("would you like fish or hamburger for lunch today?")(4) With the meals are ready ask them "would you like to eat now or later?" Don't just bring over a meal. You would be surprised at the self-satisfaction a bedridden patient obtains from simply controlling their meal time.(5) When going out let them choose destinations. ("Would you like to go to the duck pond of the children's playground?"). When outside don't just return home. Ask "Would you like to go home now or in twenty minutes?". Or: "Would you like to stop at the store on the way home?"	2	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_7923847	1729242	Wireless Communications	221	144586	May 04, 2012	One problem that invariably comes up is when an elderly person, wheelchair bound or bedridden, requires assistance from an aide who is not necessarily close by. A typical situation might be when they feel a bowel movement coming on and require assistance with the toilet. An aide cannot be expected to remain next to the person being cared for every minute. They may have to go to the kitchen, for example, or take out the garbage. Or go to the kitchen to prepare a snack or take a break. I solved this problem with my little one by purchasing a wireless electric doorbell system. These units are relatively inexpensive and range from ten to thirty-five dollars. You can even make one yourself    quite easily.    The units come with two small push buttons and a bell or chime. The buttons are designed to transmit two different signals. One is engineered to be placed on the front door. The other on the rear. Because there are different signals you know which door the visitor is at. I mounted the push buttons on a piece of wood and a strip of velcro. The velcro costs about two dollars U.S.    I secured the companion piece of velcro on the side of her bed, next to the television (on a chair) and on the side of the wheelchair. Thus the two buttons could be moved easily from one location to the other. Similarly I mounted the small chime on a velcro plastic sheet. My little one thus had TWO buttons that would transmit a unique different signal throughout the house to call someone if needed. One I marked with RED as an emergency button. The other button sounded a different chime and meant "come, but not immediately - I need something". When taking her outside I carried the chime signal in my backpack, and attached the wood with the buttons to the side of the wheelchair. In the park the signal would transmit for about 1500 feet. Different units vary in range. Thus I could park my little one and go for a drink or water or use the facilities and she had the buttons to immediately signal me. In addition, as times she wanted to be left alone to look at the birds, for example, and I could remain close by watching her without being overly attentive. The units use small AA batteries.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_7845987	1714050	When to go to assisted living?	221	187666	Apr 09, 2012	I decided to check the forums, see if there was a spot for people caring for an elderly parent. I won't go into a long winded story but briefly I'm an only child so no help from siblings. My Dad died over 3 years ago and my husband and I have had to step in to help. My mom is 83 yo, very negative, manipulative and critical. According to 2 psychologists she is BPD, a personality disorder that I won't go into. Needless to say I don't feel a lot of warm fuzzy feelings for her but I can't ignore her either. It would just be too cruel. But I've learned to keep some boundaries up to protect my own emotional health after a lifetime of being treated not very nicely.As I said she is 83, according to all the doctors she's seen, she is in fairly good health for someone her age. According to her she has hundreds of things wrong with her. I've been keeping a personal journal of her behavior: forgetting things, times of confusion, not knowing what time of day it is, losing her money, etc. Overall she is not doing well at taking care of herself in terms of eating (just candy, cookies, stuff she buys from Taco Bell and TV dinners). She has trouble understanding her bills and is now 6 months behind on her bank statement. She refuses any help in the home when we've offered. At the doctor's office she does quite well at chit chat and can be funny for those 15-20 minutes. But daily living is taking a toll on her.When do you know that it's time for a parent to go to assisted living? How do you do it? You can't just tie them up and move them. I've thought of sharing my notes with her doctor but they don't trust me either. She's led them to believe that we're taking financial advantage of her. We were quite open with Adult Protection Services and they understood it was her way of getting attention. We have no involvement with her finances at all. But now things are awkward with her doctor. She refuses to consider assisted living, swears she'll be raped there. Needless to say I'm very tired. And I never know from one day to the next whether she will like me or hate me.	10	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_7929120	1730273	Importance of a Medical Proxy	221	144586	May 06, 2012	If you have a loved one in a rehabilitation facility of nursing home is is a good idea to have them sign a medical proxy permitting you access to their medical records and to periodically make an appointment to review them for accuracy. Notations by nursing home staff can have tremendous consequences if, for example, an attempt is made to transfer the patient or get them into an assisted living facility. One little friend of mine is now in a rehab nursing home. To get her into assisted living she has to be certified to be able to walk without assistance and pass a stair climbing test and have these facts certified by the nursing staff. Unfortunately this person has a notation that they require an aide to be with them because they are "fall prone" and cannot safely walk without such assistance. What actually happened is this: The person was tired of being neglected by staff (or so she felt), and noted that patient's who fall get lots of attention. And special rehab. Thus, she "staged" make-believe falls (according to her own account), not recognizing the consequences. In any event, don't resistate to investigate and question irregularies in the record that you know may not represent absolute truth.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

It can cause episodes of cognitive confusion and memory loss that can be of concern.

Sometimes I forget to keep track of when I am cooking and things like that.I applied for a home atttendant a while back but was not found to be eligible. I have discussed potential treatments with my neurologists who are following up. They agree that I should remain where I live in the community which is what I want as well.

In April, we noticed my neutrophil count plummeting for no reason.

Negative for HIV, herpes, all forms of chronic and infectious hepatitis, autoimmune diseases, Wilson's Disease, infectious diseases and I'm a carrier of Gaucher Disease. I have seen an internist, an infectious disease doctor, hematologist, neurologist and a hepatologist/gastroenterologist. The hepatologist/gastroenterologist has ordered a whole exome sequencing, as he seems to be quite sure it is a lysosomal storage disease. Are there any lysosomal storage diseases (besides Gaucher's) that would fit the symptoms I have described?

Its not just my daughter both my boys have very similiar medical conditions and issue my daughter is just worse. I think its something genetic.One of our current biggest issues is YEAST... Tieler (DD) has a SEVERE reaccurent yeast infection in her esophagus...They can not get rid of it at all. she has had it for over a year she has had 4 endoscopys in one year and they show terrible yeast thats extremly painful to the point were she will not eat solid food she is on and elemental diet due to her EE. She has always had severe reaccurent yeast infections in other places all her life but this one takes the cake. they have tried giving her every kind of yeast med they can and she has been put on 8 prescriptions in a year without any change it is actually getting worse? She also currently has a condition called onochomodemis were her fingernails and toenails are breaking are falling out. Her other medical conditions/ info is below anyone have a kid like this? we don't know what to look at?Tieler has had:Eosiniphilc esophagitisLactose intolerantFood allregies:Anaphylactic: Egg, Peanut, Cashew, Pistachio, treenut, and MilkNon anaphylactic- IgE: soy, wheat,Oranges, Chicken, Rhye, Oat.MRI: (at age 3) Normal but delayed brain age (whatever the hell that means?)Organic acid urin test: elevated glycine?Carnitine def.Low birth weightLow muscle tone walked at 20 mo. sat up alone at 13 mo.Speech delayNormal EEG, normal sleep EEG.AsthmaShe gets re accurent infections of: Croup, respitory infections, bladder infections. She has had multiple viral infections your only suppose to get one time like hand foot and mouth (3 times) Rosiloa (5 times) she had a hospitilization for a severe case ofCdiff and has had pnemonia(pneumonia)twice and staph.She has sever vision issues if her eyes were any worse she would be leagally blind. she wears glasses that help.She does not sleep she complains of leg and feet pain at night and since birth has been a non sleeper. she has had 3 seizures, but they have no idea what causes them and up till she was 2.5 had a "shutter" that nuerologically could not be explained. it is gone now.She is at a doctor or specialist once a week I swear! and she has had 5 hospitalizations in four years.

post_7912618	1726944	Young, Intelligent, Memory Loss	146	2134785	Apr 30, 2012	Hi, I am a very high-achieving person who has excelled in school, sports, and other areas. However, I have serious memory issues relating to episodic memory, or memory of events I have lived through. The memory issues can start as early as a month or so from the date of occurrence but are far worse once a couple of years go by. I used to do plays in high school and cannot remember now (at age 25) having been in them at all, except "knowing" that I did them and having a few photographs. Similarly, I am already forgetting things (walks, movies, etc.) I did with my boyfriend of only 8 months. This kind of memory issue is very strange because it sort of rips away good and bad memories. I had depression during college (possibly BPD) but this issue has been happening for my entire life since I was a child. If anyone has read studies on this I would be very interested to see what it may be caused by.

I really need help with the diagnosis for my friend and her child's sake who is forever struggling in school, not with intelligence as such atm but more from attention and somewhat over excitement or misbehaviour and being able to sit still, even in a crowded room for instance at school she will jump up when all others are sitting down and wave with huge grin and mass amounts of energy. Having trouble finding where to ask for help but know this child is different whether some form of syndrome etc but not getting any help with local doctor.

I'm working on a sleep/wake protocol for Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome Patients. It involves exposure to Ultra Violet B during the day and reverse chronotherapy in terms of sleep onset.I need to track down a Genetic possibility.    Can a group of people turn on or off switches by surgically altering themselves over a period of many generations.For example, hypothetically lets pretend that the earlobe makes a hormone, lets say testosterone.    And an isolated group of people, for example a tribe in the Amazon, figures out that if they chop off their ear lobes the behavior of the individual tribes person changes. They decide that this is desirable and make it a religious ritual.I'm looking to understand if this is a field of known science in Genetics and what its name might be so that I can research it further.    If over the course of thousands of years of earlobe removal could that tribe might start making significant changes to their makeup and begin to look quite different than other tribes in the region who do not practice their ritual?Hope this makes sense and please don't hesitate to ask me to rephrase.	0	Genetic Switches Over Time	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

I have ehlers danlos syndrome, pots, an asd, polycystic ovary, peripheral neuropathy, hyperreflexive reflexes, anxiety, dizziness/vertigo/lightheadedness, endometriosis and a mitral valve prolapse. I has been treated for all of these I have been having exact symptoms of Arnold chiari malformation and ms. All the way up to muscle spasms, increase tachycardia, memory loss, weakness, muscle/weight loss and much more. I have been tested or stress and dep. But have neither. I am a very optimistic person and I am pre med so being diagnosed young with things has helped me learn knowledge is best to overcome fear. Anyways, I had an MRI of my brain (lying down) and found nothing as I know of (neurologist told me over phone my EEG and bloodwork was good and my MRI was pretty normal). I meet with her Thursday. She has been pretty rude to me and I'm sure because I am young, but I have been in so much pain from my body and persistent head pressure following with migraines, that I've actually resulted to taking my left over pain killers from post labor. I HATE medications and pk's make me feel sick but it's worth it to get rid of the pain. They said no sign of ms or acm from brAin MRI and the neurosurgeon my pcp talked to said a standing isn't necessary. I don't know what else do do or expect. These symptoms are very real and very debilitating and with my son being 13 months and husband going into training for marines soon, for my sons safety I need to take anoter approach to help myself and pcp try to figure out what possible culprits there could be.Thank you!J	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_7778509	1701011	Any suggestions I should approach my dr with to help her?	146	2074215	Mar 17, 2012	Many here have vision problems and I have taken the liberty to break up your post into much more manageable sections.√Ç  √Ç  Here are your words broken into something more friendly.......................................................I guess I'll start with my diagnoses first. I have POTS, an ASD, mitral valve prolapse, polycystic ovary, endometriosis, peripheral neuropathy, HORRIBLE circulation, ehlers danlos syndrome (classical), hyperreactive joints and anxiety (since I was younger).I am almost 23, female obviously, and just had my first baby at 22. I have had two surgeries that took place September and December 2009 (1: laparoscopy, hysteriscopy + dnc. 2: a tumor removed off of my coccyx as well as the last 2 vertebrae).After these, I had horrible hemorrhaging, severe weight loss because of vommitting violently 20 minutes after every meal and could not have bowel movements for WEEKS at a time, even laxatives and the pre-colonoscopy liquid medicine didn't help. My kidneys and intestines started shutting down/not moving. Lasics helped my kidneys but my intestines only started BARELY moving ( went a moth and a half with only 2 bowel movements).A year After I had my son, I completely changed my diet to a very healthy diet as well as stopped drinking any caffiene, sodas, or alcohol unless special ocassions (and even ten maybe one glass of wine, two at most). Around this time I started getting (everything all around same time and it progresses slowly over time, now it's much worse than when it all started): extreme pressure in my head feeling like my eyes would pop out, rushing sounds in my ears, vertigo, heavy and tight feeling chest, many times my heart felt like it was bruised because te faster itd beat, the more painful it was, hard to breathe with the smallest amount of exertion, loss of appetite, feeling completely weak and collapsing, memory lapse, dazing spells, black/purple feet and hands always cold with tingling, constant numbness, pressure in my arteries in my arms like someone was holding in a bad spot, always tired, swelling in left calf (which I thought was from my varicose veins in my inner thighs), muscle spasms everywhere, constant tremmors in my hands, extreme confusion, clumsines, aching all over life i have the flu, low grade fevers, migraines (which I've never had),higher blood pressure than normal (both diastolic and systolic) even with a very healthy diet, aching all the time, dizziness, bruises all over my body for no reason at all and much more common than before pregnancy, more tachycardic than normal, stiff and very sore back and neck, blacking out, sharp pains in chest and stomach, passing out and hard time urinating sometimes while other times I can't even feel when I have to urinate, I have to rely on the pressure or when my pants get too tight.My neurologist (which seems to not believe me) ordered an MRI, EEG and b12 testing. All apparently came out negative for anything. She was very rude (which I've shadowed plenty specialists and know some have their days, but telling me I'm absent minded and my geneticist doesn't know what she's talking about diagnosing me with EDS is extremely poor bedside manners). I have done things that aren't just "forgetfulness" that I can't remember doing minutes later and they are extremely important, some could have negatively affected my child if my husband didn't pay attention, which a couple were when I fed my son and took off his tray (which I never do) and walked out of the room as well as another time I almost gave him medicine 5 minutes after I had already given him medicine. I am ADHD so I know what forgetfulness is and this is not the case.My neurologist told my pcp that she suspected MS but had told me everything was fine and thought it was in my head. I am pre-med and my pcp has even called my father saying she will back me up any day and she'll do whatever it takes to figure this out because every time I have felt "off" no one but my pcp was persistent in figuring out the cause. The results were always something rare or that needed treatment.I'm very worried my neurologist is just going to write me off like many others and I know stress has many similar debilitating symptoms but not all of mine. My pcp knows I'm not stressed or depressed and is treating my anxiety properly. I have gotten through college at a private school who tells their students not to expect to do as well as they desire to because they try to sift people out. I made wonderful grades and didn't even know I was ADHD until junior year so needless to say I worked my butt off. If I wasn't overly stressed then, then I certainly am not now. All other problems are being treated with medication.I JUST can't and won't be Okay with raising my son knowing I could harm him. My husband won't even let me drive him anymore, and I understand why. I just need some insight, if possible.I do have very bad bruising, worse than before symptoms started, and I know manynof these sound like lupus (I have a step cousin with lupus) and I do have a 2nd cousin with Lou gherrigs disease as well. Please please please give me any type of insight possible.I know you can't possibly diagnose me, but some possibilities I can have in mind so I can approach my neurologist or pcp with ideas would be fantastic and helpful. I am a genetics fanatic and have tried to approach it through family history, turning up at a dead end.

post_7773680	1700123	MTHFR and pregnancies	146	2077072	Mar 15, 2012	I received a phone call this evening from my OB/GYN and they told me that it had been discovered that I have this MTHFR, that he didn't know much about it, and was having a specialist call me to set up an appointment.I have one almost 4 year old daughter, who was born Deaf.I had 3 miscarriages with in an 18 month time frame prior to my full term pregnancy. All 3 pregnancies were lost at 7 weeks exactly. Not 7w 1d, 6w 6d, 7 weeks 0 days on the dot. My husband and I think I miscarried in February 2011, but aren't sure as I never did have a positive pregnancy test, yet was late enough that it should've caught something. (I know withing a 24 hour time frame of when I will start, and am rarely off schedule.)I take a prenatal vitamin daily as it makes me feel better than a regular multivitamin. I've read that some of the B vitamins are good to take, along with your regular vitamins, but what else is out there that I could take to help?Could my daughter hearing disability be related to the MTHFR? I have always credited my regular physician (prior to moving out of state) for saving my pregnancy - I had gone in because I wasn't feeling well, had a negative pregnancy test (urine test and blood test), was diagnosed with strep throat with a touch of the flu, and sent on my way with meds. I was told to come back in 10 days, so I did, and that's when I was told I was pregnant. I honestly believe that doctor saved my baby girl. I was about 5-6 weeks along when I was prescribed the meds.None of my doctors in the past had ever really cared about my losses, or seemed like they cared. I met this doctor, and he's amazing. He looked so angry when I told him about my history, and he promised he would find out what was going on. It took 4 months for the test results to come back, but he's helped a ton.Sorry I'm rambling. I'm just so confused, sad, upset, angry, you name it.I'm young - just turned 28 a few days ago.Is there anyone out there who has been through this? That has gone on to have healthy, happy babies? That could give me advice, pointers, anything?Thanks a million in advance.	0	MTHFR,MTHFR and pregnancy,Pregnancy,Miscarriage,Blood,blood disorders,deafness,Advice,support, help	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

A neurologist was consulted, who after CT Scan of brain, diagnosed Deep White matter brain Ischemia, Cerebral Atrophy and Parkinsonsism. Syndopa 110 (half tablets thrice daily), Tremnil 2 (half tablets thrice daily)    is being administered. But the condition goes on deteriorating instead of improvement. He cannot talk,walk or think properly. These symptoms were not there in the month of February, 2012. All these symptoms have developed after the administration of drugs. Recently Somazina Plus (Citicholine 500mg + Neurocetam 800 mg) is being administered. But no appreciable improvements are noticed.Kindly advise.	1	None	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

That has had some forgetfulness and mild hallucinations to a women that can no longer dress her self or complete a sentence, We took her to neurologist and he did some testing in office that day.... Said she had some Dementia going on and started her on lowest dose Exelon patch with in 6 days she was paranoid and begging to go home ( she was home ) to go thru cabinets and gathering things to episodes of agitation ... We called Doc he sent us to Geriatric Pysch Doc that thought my Mom should be placed into Geriatric Pysch ward and be evaluated for Dementia , I told then my Mom' s rapid decline since starting exelon and short dose of Risperdone for Pyschoctic episodes..... She did 11 days in GeriPysch they add Zyprexa to the mix and within 4 days she was grabbing stuff out of the air that wasn't there having trouble using the right words and aggressive behavior.... She was taken to Nursing home and they said that they would take her off everything and let her dry out see what the behavior was like off all meds.... The only thing they D/C was the Exelon Patch they kept the Zyprexa and add seroquel .25 mg twice a day..... Now she doesn't know who we are half the time she can't sit still can't complete a sentence of more than 5 words that make no sense ..... She went from memory loss and confusion and some hallucinations to someone that looks like end stage Demenia .... Can this happen in less than 2 months????? We are fighting to get her off Anti- Pysch meds since the decline is even more rapid .....please help !!!!

post_8229151	1788278	Memory loss/confusion from complex migraine??	1428	3050656	Aug 11, 2012	Hi! I am in the process of having more tests done, but it seems my docs don't even know which direction to LOOK. One doc gave me 10 different "guesses" as to what she thought the cause of my memory loss/confusion is.    I am a 35yr old female, w/ history of migraine w/ aura & several episodes of "complicated migraine". 2-3 months ago, I had an episode that they can only assume was a complicated migraine (MRI & EEGs were normal). The severity of the episode improved over 24-48hrs (I had gotten lost while driving around, in a familiar place, couldn't remember how to use my phone to get help, & was confused by everything...signs, words, conversations, etc)...except some memory loss & confusion. I have a hard time with timelines, what seems like happened 2-3 wks ago, I am told happened only a day ago. I can only remember bits & pieces of things, & what I DO remember, seems like it happened several weeks ago (like trying to recall a dream that you only vaguely remember). My thoughts get "jumbled up" & I don't know what's what sometimes (makes me wonder if it's an actual complicated migraine when that happens). But I don't know if complicated migraines can leave you with ongoing memory loss & confusion like this. I can't "hold on" to information for more than a few seconds before I have to get the info again. I usually can't recall the things I've done earlier in the day...like my brain is just not making a memory of it.The neurologist I saw after my ER visit told me it could be a vitamin B-12 deficiency (and advised I started taking a B-complex vitamin...which I have been taking every day since then), she also suggested it could be hypothryoidism (which my mom has, & my tests last year were normal...but I plan to ask for a re-test), she also suggested a sleep disorder (but I've had trouble falling asleep since I was a kid, & nothing has changed). My doc is on the verge of calling this an early-onset form of dementia... I am even exploring psychiatric causes (schizophrenia) but I have no family history of that. I just want to know which direction to go in, & hope that it's something that can be TREATED.I know you can't diagnose on here, I was just hoping for some insight & medical opinions on what possibilities can cause this, b/c right now my docs seems stumped (and so do I), & I haven't yet seen the 2nd neuro (who I hope doesn't play pin-the-tail-on-the-patient w/ her diagnoses like the last one). :)Thank you for ANY insight/opinions you can share!~Kim	4	Memory loss,confusion,complex migraines,Memory,Migraines	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

post_8596057	1857312	spots on the brain and an alzheimer diagnosis	170	4458811	Dec 07, 2012	my 60 yr old sister just received a diagnosis of probable alzheimers.    I am uncomfortable with this information/diagnosis and believe it is premature.    I am not EXACTLY sure these were the words used by the Dr, or just what her mind heard.    The Dr did a brain scan (not sure which type) and found spots on her brain.    He stated these spots may be due to small strokes which she suffered -at some time in her life- and intends to do additional testing(in attempt to determine the cause of the spots).    She has demonstrated    small levels of forgetfulness through the years, slightly increasing, but not to the point that it is affecting her functionality. She has ALWAYS been a bit 'scatter-brained' and she and her husband feel it has gotten worse.    The rest of the family, who do not see her regularily, have noticed a slight change when she is stressed only. Our father passed away 3 years ago from cancer (at 80) and had been diagnosed with Alzheimers 4 years earlier. His symptoms were obvious but he was still living at home with assistance from his wife. I am concerned that my sister, is using Dad's diagnosis as a fatalistic prognosis without waiting for a full/complete work up.    What can be told by brain spots?    What additional testing should we expect to see?    What reading is available for me to research Alzheimer diagnostics? She has not told the whole family 'until she gets the rest of the testing done', which I agree with.    I just wish she would wait for the tests too.    She believes she has alzheimers and consequently is very depressed.    I would like to help her open her mind to possible alternate diagnosis-at least until a more conclusive diagnosis can be made and other causes eliminated.	6	None	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,
post_8630027	1863043	Normal Memory Lapse?	170	1722857	Dec 17, 2012	A week ago I had an odd memory lapse that really frightened me. To give you some back information, I'm a 29 year old female in good health with no family history of Alzheimer's.I was decorating the Christmas tree with my fianc√É ©. He was placing decorations on the tree while I was stringing up the lights. As I was putting the lights on the tree, I came across an ornament. It was a dried starfish with a sand dollar attached to it. I started to say, "Hey, I really like this...." and then blanked on the word starfish. It took me approximately 15 seconds to remember what I was called. I knew as I was staring at it what it was but I couldn't produce the word.I will admit I'm a bit prone to anxiety and do have a tendency to always think the worst, but could this be an early sign of young-onset Alzheimer's? I haven't had any other major issues such as forgetting appointments or not being able to preform daily tasks. I've had infrequent moments of forgetting someone's name, but then I'm able to recall it after a moment.Is this just a normal bout of a memory lapse? Or should I be more concerned?Thank you.M	7	Memory,Memory lapse	new,Memory,Headaches,new treatment,Altzheimer's Disease,aging,winter,alzheimer,health care,YOU!,Sleep Apnea,grey,treatment,short term memory loss,Family History,increase,forgetting,alzheimer's,Cyst,Alzheimer's disease,matter,Depression,brain tumor,stress,Memory lapse,MRI,Bipolar,Gland,Memory loss,dementia,

post_8596143	1857327	sunlight deficiency and winter depression	170	4458811	Dec 07, 2012	I am a 56 year old woman living    in the northern mid west.    Up here our winters tend to be cloudy and sunshine is the exception not the rule.    I have noticed the older I get, the more 'blue' days I experience.    I am in fairly good health with the exception of lower back issues.    I have degenerative disk disease for which I am undergoing pain management. I have an internal neuro-stimulator, wear fentanyl patches and use hydrocodon for break through pain.    I feel more pain when I get cold and consequently do not like to be outside at this time of the year.    Unfortunately I experience functional/depression- not sure that is an offocial thing but sums up my state.    I know I am depressed but can meet the basic requirements of my dialy living.    I find that I must force myself to go out and usually do so only when I can not avoid it.    This is beginning to affect the relationship with my husband.    I know there are many times that we would socialize if not for me 'not feeling well'.    I do not feel like this during the summer months, or when we vacation to warmer climates during the winter months.    I am physical when it is warmer.    I golf, garden, walk, etc.    I am wondering if this depression could be tied to sunlight deficiency or if it is just cold winter blues.

She occasionally forgets words (she notices this) and also mixes words up - he/she - knife/fork. I should point out that English is not her first language, but she tells me she sometimes forgets words in polish too, and she never used to do this before.Recently she seems to forget things, like her phone or keys.She has been to the doctor and scored perfectly on the cognitive test - Count backwards from 100 by deducting 7 - Remember these three items - What is the date? -    Those kind of things.The doctor has ordered blood tests (Thyroid - blood count - liver function - and some others) But we haven't had the results yet.She has recently started a new business (investing her own money) and I know that this is a stress on her. Although she never acts stressed or tells me she feels stressed.Has anyone gone through anything similar?

post_8519938	1843740	When to ask for Home Health?	221	1720063	Nov 15, 2012	My Mom (67) just had throat surgery Friday to remove a cancerous tumor. The surgeon removed a tonsil and a large portion of the back of her tongue. The surgery went smooth, but the recovery has not. She developed major congestion Sunday. Chest x-rays showed no pneumonia, but both lungs were partially deflated (Atelectasis). The doctor started her on antibiotics. She can't be suctioned due to the swelling and risk of bleeding. She was better Monday, but still had a bad cough. She failed a swallow test on Monday, and gets nothing by mouth except ice chips. We were told she is high risk for aspirating.They discharged her Tuesday (too soon IMO), and my daughter and I have been taking care of her. She is still on oxygen and gets continuous tube feeding (through her nose). We have been working hard with the Incentive Spirometer to strengthen her lungs, and she is walking around the house with a walker.She is still coughing and the congestion is still bad. She still cannot cough it up. At 1:00am today, she had another coughing spell. She coughed, choked, gagged, and vomited. It was globs of mucus tinged with blood. We called the ambulance and headed to the ER. The position of the feeding tube was checked, a chest x-ray looked identical to the last one on Sunday, and all the lab results were fine. We were told that the congestion caused the vomiting, and the blood came from her large, open wound in her mouth/throat. We took her back home, but now we are nervous, Her follow-up appointment with her surgeon is Monday, and that seems like an eternity now! I was hoping they would keep her at the hospital until the congestion cleared up.Would this be a situation that meets the requirements for us to get some Home Health help? We've got all the basics figured out (feeds, oxygen, hygiene, etc), but we have no idea what is an emergency (or even a concern)and what isn't. We are feeling extremely overwhelmed today.

post_8695880	1873775	Felt-Tip pens and stroke rehab	221	144586	Jan 05, 2013	The very elderly and stroke-disabled often have difficulty in using a ball-point pen or pencil. On one of my visits to a nursing home last week to help out a friend I brought her packages of "sharpies" in many colors, and a bristol-board pad upon which to draw. Bright purple, red, green, blue and many pastel shades in between. I prefer the fine points. She has trouble sharpening a pencil or using a ball-point pen, but delights in using the markers. Because she has a tendency to leave the caps off I purchase them in six-packs. These will bleed through ordinary paper, however bristol-board pads are available that will not bleed through. I have used these markers with severely damaged stroke patients, who cannot hold a pen or pencil wil sufficient pressure against paper to make a mark. They come on both non-toxic and toxic varieties. The non-toxic have a water-based solvent, which unfortunately, does not make as bold a mark, mark as easily or is indelible,so I prefer the ordinary versions.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8658930	1867704	Physical Therapy	221	144586	Dec 26, 2012	Both Medicaid and Medicare    patients are entitled to physical therapy. Medicaid limits this to 25 visits per year. Medicare has a $155 deductable and then pays 80% to a cap of $1860. I just got through visiting an 86 year old friend in a nursing home who has not been getting this therapy and who would benefit greatly. My point in this post is to make sure the nursing home in which your loved one is staying "gets off the dime" in this respect. The squeaky wheel gets the grease. These sessions which consist of varied exercises, assisted walking and range-of-motion invariably result in significant improvement in "quality of life". If you arrange to have this done at home keep track of the time the therapist arrives and leaves. My experience is that otherwise they tend to "short" the time.    It helps to observe them so you can learn the drills to use when they are not there.	0	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8638643	1864408	Swallowing Difficulty, medications, Bananas	221	144586	Dec 19, 2012	Swallowing difficulties are common in the elderly. Especially stroke patients. There are various degrees of difficulty. Problems with swallowing pills is common. If swallowing is normal except for the inability to swallow pills first try placing the pill UNDER the tongue and then having the patient drink an ordinary quantity of water or liquid. The pill will usually magically end up in the tummy. Another way uses ripe banana. You crush the pill and place the medication in a glob of mashed banana. Banana is sometimes contraindicated because of the potassium content, however a small bit (an inch or so) will not cause problems. Thyroid medication can often be introduced in this manner, as well as ordinary antibiotics. The mashed bit of banana has just enough substance to cause the patient to swallow the pill. Follow up with a sip of liquid.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

This is sick child's only vacation/wish in yrs. It's all about her last "trip/wish/vacation." She does deserve it, for she has endured much pain and heartache due to her fatal disease. This sick child is living w/her Aunt and family along w/her mom. Her mom need's the help of her sister and their mother. The hotel room is going to be too small 4 all but 4 poeple. The sick child need's quiet time and can't be out very much at all due to her disease, so it limit's the fun. It would be no fun for the cousin, but she is upset, angry, sad, and jealous and making it KNOWN to her mother leaving her feeling guilty as to not taking her. The child has school, as this trip will take place in week 1 of Dec. It is obvious it is not a option to take her due to the demands needed of the sick child and her mother need's the help of her sister.The father of the 11 yr. old is upset as well, feeling everyone should go! I've heard the story and it is BEST for the sick child & financial wise to just have the 4 people go and give this child a "dream" vacation at the very least.How can it be resolved? THis child is upset, but more "acting" out we think just because. It is really worrying the mom and now the father.This family need's some help with this, and I'd like to offer it to them if ANYONE out there will help answer what to do/say? If U R a medical professional/homemaker/grandmother...WHO√¢ Ä ¶ help me find answer's to help them "help" resolve this sad situation. It's not that they don't understand the child's upset, it's just they seem to NOT know how to handle it and being a good confidant...I don't have any answer's for them. IIF YOU CAN OFFER ADVICE, PLEASE DO SO. I'LL PASS IT ON TO THE FAMILY AND HOPE SOMEONE CAN FIND THE RIGHT WORDS/SCENARIO TO PRESENT TO THIS CHILD FOR COMFORT, AND SHE IS I SUPPOSE TO YOUNG (MAYBE) TO UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF THIS ISSUE...MUCH APPRECIATED...THANK YOU. FYI: ill child is 18 YRS./bed-ridden/O2dependant/extremely weak but this is her wish.	7	jealousy,daughter jealousy,explosive jealousy,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,family,father/daughter relationships, child age appropriate,age appropriate discipline,age appropriate tips	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8409923	1823877	Disowned, what next?	221	187666	Oct 10, 2012	It's been a difficult 4+ years since my Dad died and we've been trying to take care of my mom (now 84). She's always been extremely volatile: critical, negative, manipulative. But as her only child (she disowned her other child whom she left with the bio father) her care has been my concern. It's been hard since for a few weeks she'll think we (my husband and I) are terrific, what would she do without us. Then she'll turn on one or both of us, getting very angry. At times she'll say: don't call, don't come over but with no explanation. Then within a few days she'll act like everything is just fine.Last week was horrid with her making accusations against me to my husband. When he tried to defend me, she blew up. I had a talk with her on Sunday and it was uncomfortable since this is the first time in my life I pushed back a bit, not rude or disrespectful but I did push to discuss the things she had said about me. She seemed OK, we went out to do errands and eat lunch as I do twice a week with her (she doesn't drive).Today I called (I call her as well 2-3 times a week). She insisted that she "can't do this any more", she's miserable, her life is a mess, she enjoys my company but doesn't want me to ever come over again. We talked for a bit more, I tried to understand what she was trying to say but it didn't make sense. She insisted that I don't come over. I told her I didn't agree but I would respect her wishes since I didn't want to cause her any misery. She said she loved me and hung up.Although she's been angry before and told us to buzz off, this sounded very final. The first thing I did was call her doctor's office. This is way more than I can handle and felt it was time to involve a professional. The nurse (fantastic woman) called me back and we had a great discussion. She's agreed that she's seen a downward spiral since my Dad died and she will talk with the doctor tomorrow. They will deal with this. She did say I could try calling my mom on Sunday, see if she's cooled down.Long story actually but I've kept it as brief as I can. Is there anything else I should be doing?	6	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8384189	1818924	Lockbox for Nursing Home Residents	221	144586	Oct 02, 2012	A nice gift for someone in a nursing home, either on a temporary basis (for rehab) or permanently, is a small metal lockbox that can fit in one of the small bedside drawers allotted residents. They sell for between $8.00 and $20.00 U.S. circa 2012 and come with either keys or combination locks. If you get one with a key have extra keys made before you take it to the home. Seal one key in an envelope and secrete it somewhere in the room (A good place is under a drawer) and keep the other one. If you get a combination lock set it to an easily remembered combination, such as the year the patient was born.    A nice touch for a female patient is to spray-paint it pink and apply a floral decal. Though the amounts are small,    money and inexpensive jewelry tend to disappear in nursing homes. I'm not sure if the issue is kleptomania, but there is a surroundings where there are many people with dementia wandering around. Patient's like to have a small amount of cash handy for vending machines and snacks. Keeping cash unsecured indefinitely is an invitation for problems.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8379415	1817957	Eviction after Death or Nursing Home	221	144586	Oct 01, 2012	When an elderly person is in a subsidized elderly "project", and either dies or ends up in a nursing home the "landlord" often sends a notice ordering the apartment to be surrendered wit the end of the month. The notice is official, generally coming from the office of an atorney. In the case of a death this means the apartment must be cleaned out within a space of perhaps two weeks. In many cases this is an impossible burden for relatives, who may also be frail and elderly.    In the situation with a nursing home, it may mean if the person is released from the home they will have no apartment. The fact of the matter these letters are bogus, designed to frighten and intimidate, and in point-of-fact the landlord has to utilize "due process" to evict. (To forestall eviction someone has to continually occupy the apartment). "Due Process" means a court hearing at housing court.    You won't need an attorney if you are only "buying time". At every court hearing at the first appearance you are entitled to what is called an "all-purpose adjournment". If you request this there will be another court date scheduled. You don't have to give a reason for an "all purpose adjourment".    You cannot be forced to vacate the apartment unti the judge issues an order, and then you mwill have additional time.    In case of death this gives you fron one to three additional months to clear out the home. In the case of a nursing home situation, the matter becomes more complex. In the case of one elderly woman I am involved with she was placed in a rehab nursing home and ended up with a guardianship, for complicated reasons. She is an artist and her apartment is filled with art she created. We went to court to forestall eviction and after two years, she still has not been evicted (we are still in court), although she has been in a nursing home, hoping to be eventually released.	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

post_8323650	1806880	The Peg Decison - When Elderly can't Swallow	221	144586	Sep 12, 2012	The PEG stands for percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy. A surgically emplaced feeding tube. My little one had one emplaced at age 104 (her decision) and she is doing fine at 108. At home with her son and private aides. Many elderly are reluctant to have a feeding tube and I will offer some comments. Many people, contrary to popular belief, tolerate them very well with little discomfort. My little one is in that universe of people. They have to be replaced every six months to eighteen months, primarily because the feeding tube becomes clogged with residue. There are several types available. Consult your physician. These are prescribed for those who cannot swallow (dysphagia), often secondary to a stroke. If swallowing resumes they can be removed. A patient can eat soft pureed foods while on a peg as the swallowing returns. Nutrition is provided either by bolus or continuous feed. You can do both. Bolus feed one day and continuous feed the next or at night. Or continuous feed at night and give a bolus feed at noon. Bolus feeding is best.    With bolus feeding the patient can be taken outdoors or on trips and not be attached to a machine. The bolus feeding is, however more labor intensive, and in a nursing home they invariably select continuous feeding, which means the patient will not move in the bed, and is likely to develop bedsores and clots. Furthermore they will not permit you or anyone else to come in and "bolus feed". "Insurance regulations", they say. If you have insurance home-care the home-care agencies will refuse to service the peg, forcing you to call in a registered nurse. This is often an unaffordable option. I trained home-care aides with no experience to perform the servicing, and they are paid for by the family. The "fiction" is that the son does the feeding. Think three to four man (or woman) hours a day for bolus feeding. That's an hour or so three times a day. The key to bolus feeding is to always clean and service the tube and flush it. A bit of seven-up and then a squire of saline. And to care for the dressing to prevent infection. I use an ultraviolet filter and HEPA unit in the room to insure it is dust free. You don't want infection to end up in the opening. The bolus syringes are meant to be one-time use. Nevertheless people re-use them.    If re-used insure they are sterilized. This means dust filters on open windows and a freshly-painted dust free room. Keep a digital camera in the room and when the aides change the dressing take a     photo of the opening. You can review this and e-mail it to a physician. This way you can watch for inflamation(inflammation).	1	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,
post_8293843	1800879	Normal dementia or manipulation?	221	187666	Sep 02, 2012	This is a bit difficult to describe so please bear with me. My mother has some personality issues, has always been controlling, manipulative, angry and negative. That's her "norm." A couple of psychologists have listed her as having a personality disorder. Now that she's getting older I'm not sure what is mental decline in terms of forgetfulness and paranoia and what's just a ploy to get our attention.She complains constantly about being in pain or having this health issue or another. Yet when I manage to get an appt. for her, she cancels it. She says she can't see anything very well but cancelled the eye appt. She complains about pain all over but has cancelled the rheumy appt. once and is considering canceling the next one. She misplaced her will several months ago, recently calls me almost every day in a panic about it, asks me over and over if I have it (I don't) but then when I mention going to a lawyer to get a new one made, she doesn't want to.Yesterday we went over and she met us outside with the comment - OK, we're going to have it out right here and now. I had no idea what she was angry about. Turns out she couldn't find her wallet. I had taken her out the day before to buy a few things and I was almost positive she had it in the car. We spent 2 hours looking for it in the house, calling her credit card and bank people and fraud people. Miraculously she walked into a bedroom and found it under a stack of clothes. Had to call them all back.This is probably an impossible question to answer but is there a way to tell what's true confusion (because I want to be helpful) and what's game playing? She is 84 and lives on her own. Refuses to move to assisted living.	4	None	IBS,daughter jealousy,borderline disorder cure cure,TERMINAL ILLNESSES,age appropriate discipline,caregiver,chronic,website,Chronic Pain,father/daughter relationships,suicidal thoughts,age appropriate tips,family,Pain,jealousy,explosive jealousy,Migraines,

Finding that there are good days and bad days with this disease. Last night my father was speaking with my sister in CA (we live in MI) and she was talking about her boyfriend of 25 years and my father emphatically believed that he was simply her landlord and not her boyfriend and even had trouble remembering his name. My father lives alone in a house about 40 minutes away from me.My father has always been a rational and logical person. Watching this deterioration is heart-breaking. Anyways brought this issue up and asked him what he expected me to do with this information since he is always in denial about things like this. He told me that he knows he is having a "little" trouble and instructed me not to do anything and that he will let me know when it is time for me to step in and help. I told him that I am worried that he may be out driving one day and forget what yield means or what a red light means and that he may injure himself or someone else. That didn't seem to phase him.Guess I am looking for advice. Don't want to forcibly put him in any home. We've toured Assisted Living facilities, and as nice as they are nowadays, in his mind they are just dressed up final resting place before death. I won't force him into any place like that unless the care he would require is beyond my ability.Thank you to all for any advice.Laurie	2	None	None

On a recent ER visit, I ask the doctor about this. He said that the memory loss is not caused by the migraine, but offered no advice on what to do. What kind of doctor does she need to see to have this checked out? need help.	1	None	None
post_8660432	1867950	IS THERE LONG TO GO....?	1465	4059843	Dec 27, 2012	Hello. Well my grandad has had dementia for over 7 years now, and he is in a nursing home. Being a teenager it was quite difficult for me to cope at home, with the chaos between him and my grandma and mum. He started getting violent and thats when we decided enough was enough. And that he had to go in to the nursing home then because it was getting just too much. That was over 1 year ago. So anyway, instead of telling you a story, all i want to really ask is (if anyone knows...), around about how long might my grandad have till he may pass away. I mean he is now lying in a bed unable to move properly. Isnt able to walk, and sometimes is almost unresponsive (verbally). He is able to talk a bit, crackinga few jokes every now and then, but there are other times where he just stared at the wall and says nothing. How long might he have left?	0	None	None

I moved her into my homeand took care of her until her doctor advised a skilled nursing home for her.    I visited her every day andit was heartbreaking to see her decline.    Now I am really concerned that I will also get it too. I have been told that walking everyday is one way to stave off this    progressive disease.    Is there anything else I can do?Your help would be very much appreciated.    Thank you.    joyanna 243	2	None	None

Thalassemia minor.Taking dextroamphetamine & lexapro for many years, significantly helped with my fatigue depression, caused by Thal Minor.Hemoglobin historically in 10 to 11 range, workable.Recently, dropped significantly to 7.2.Went to hospital, turned down transfusion.Wanted EPO, but insurance only covers if kidney disease present, which it is not.Released 2 days later with hemo of 7.8.Checked again 2 weeks ago, trending down, 6.8.New symptoms after drop; chronic muscle pain(neck and shoulders), headaches, extreme fatigue....QUESTIONS:Would EPO be effective in raising hemo a few points....If yes, are there any organizations which would help with cost of EPO, since few insurance companys cover treatment.Taking Testosterone can have side effect of increasing RBC count.    Test done before hemoglobin & hct became issue.        Reason for test, check for Low T.Question:    Is there any clinical implication for use with Thal minor, if Low T levels present....Question:    Can you or your colleagues suggest any clinical study organizations which may be involved....Finally, while reading the blogs, no one seems to consider transfusions.    What are your thoughts on transfusions....Appreciate helpful suggestions.Thank you so much,sailny2	0	Thalacemia trait	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

Let me start off by saying how much I admire him and all his accomplishments.    I brag about him every chance I get so please do not confuse this post with a jealously issue.    Growing up, and now we were and are complete opposites.    He has always been brave; I have always avoided confrontation and was frankly afraid to fight.    He has always been a gifted athlete; I have been the guy sitting on the bench waiting for coach to put me in.    Then performed pretty lousy once coach did put me in.He is good looking, always had and continues to attract the beauties; whereas I have not been so lucky.    A bit taller than me, perfect teeth, eyesight etc whereas I have crooked teeth am fat and had to get corrective eye surgery to finally ditch my glasses.He is well off financially and is a Major in the armed forces.    I am constantly wondering if I will have enough money for groceries.I do believe that our experiences play a role in how we turn out, but there is no arguing that my younger brother is superior to me (again I am not complaining) in so many ways.

post_8346023	1811509	becoming very worried about six year old daughter	146	744144	Sep 20, 2012	When I was pregnant with my now six year old, I had a two vessel cord and they found at my 20 week sonogram that she had AV canal malformation (basically, her heart looked like a donut and she only had one large valve across the top of her heart instead of two.)they said with the combination of these two things, she had a 70% chance of having Down's.She does not have Down's, and before she was born, the bottom portion of the hole in her heart grew tissue which "closed" it, changing her heart defect to a "partial AV canal", "atrioventricular canal defect" or "ASD primum"She had open heart surgery at 6 months old, and her heart has been doing great. when she was a little over a year old, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, which has very strangely become normal now.She had some breathing issues (minor obstructive sleep apnea...had her tonsils and adnoids removed) and her pulmonary dr sent us to a genetic specialist, who spent not even five minutes with my daugther, who said "I think she has a connective tissue disorder...that's probably what caused her heart defect..follow up with your cardiologist" and blew us off.Now, at age six, she is very active and plays at school and plays sports. For the past six months or so, her elbows and shoulders pop very loudly when she wakes up and she moans in pain.    Now, she is also complaining of pain in her fingers, ankles and knees. They pop loudly and wake her up from her sleep, crying at times.She is very flexible and has very soft skin (one of the concerns the pulmonary dr had at age one) and I am now worried that she may have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or something like that.I don't know what type of doctor I need to take her to. When I mentioned the concern to my pediatrician, he said he wasn't worried about it....but I am.Does anyone have any information that can help?Thank you very much for your help!	0	None	Prion Disease,VCFS,anorexia,deafness,paternity,Period,complications,Birth defects,male,hypotonic,puberty,Genetics,bone,Huntington's disease,daughter,growth,ssri,support,Puberty concerns,Neurology,Rare Syndrome,Advice,donating blood,DNA,surgery,chimerism,prominent,hypotonia,Blood,malabsorption,

post_8514094	1842547	sudden onset of memory loss	1428	4325540	Nov 13, 2012	My significant other is a young male late 20's no serious medical issues. He recently had an episode where he lost complete knowledge of the world around him. Did not know who anyone was, where he was. Could not recall the month etc. He said he had a warm burning sensation in his head accompanied by a headache. After about 2 hours of going in and out of this state, he regained his full memory (but could not recall the memory lapse episode). His body showed signs of weakness up until about 8 hours after the incident. No specific side of the body, just lack of strength to stand up on his own and what seemed like motor impairment. My first thought was he had a stroke... is this possible? He did not show any signs of weakened facial muscles or an extended period of time with weakened limbs. There was no visible sign of the body experiencing any trauma immediately before the SUDDEN memory loss. Any thoughts? He does have some signs of PTSD from military past. Could this be related? He had been drinking that night but much less than usual.	3	None	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

post_8451808	1831206	Chronic Head Pressure/Mental Fog	1428	1459923	Oct 24, 2012	I'm a 51 year old male and have had fatigue, chronic forehead pressure, and mental fog for 30+ years. I'm otherwise in good health and exercise at least 6 days/week. I'm incredibly frustrated by this condition as it's cost me both personally and professionally.I'm highly allergic to a lot of grasses, trees, molds, etc. and have been through about 6 rounds of shots and drops since 1994 to no avail. Allergy retest each time I start a round back up have shown the same allergic response so it's apparent my body isn't building up an immunity. Also have had expensive food allergy test ($1000 skin prick and a $750 ALCAT blood test). Skin prick showed allergic response to all foods except pork and chocolate whereas the ALCAT showed intolerance to less foods. My symptoms have gotten more chronic over the last few years. I've also been to 2 neurologists, tried various antidepressants, had spinal tap, MRI's, botox injections, etc. etc. all to no avail.Note that I had sinus surgery 10 years ago and sinuses drain fine.Had a few questions:1. Do my symptoms sound like they are related to food intolerance (ie: sinus cavities) , facial nerve inflammation, or facial muscle tension?2. What clinic in the US is the best at treating environmental or food type allergies/intolerances? What about clinics for chronic pressure type symptoms and/or heachache?3. Could sinuses be the culprit even though I can breath fine and have no congestion? ie: inflamed lining that are able to drain properly.	1	chronic head pressure,mental fog	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,
post_8425444	21	memory loss at 21	1428	4157590	Oct 16, 2012	I have had memory loss for a long time now. I have gone through some trauma in my life, but I have never banged my head or been in a car accident. I have been emotionally abused and was in a bad controlling relationship 4 years ago. I am 21 years old, yet as soon as events happen I don't remember them unless I see pictures or hear someone recall a happy event. For example, they will say remember when? and then they will tell a story and I don't remember it until they explain. I don't remember my childhood. I know I don't have PTSD, but I know something is not right and I need answers. I have gone to a counselor, but no diagnosis as far as I know. I have 2 kids. They are 3 and 4 years old. I dont even remember what they looked like when they were little. I can't picture many things in my head when I close my eyes and try to remember things. Lately I have been looking at people, then close my eyes to see if I can picture what they look like but I can't. I know I don't have prosopagnosia. I have a hard time comprehending things when I read and I don't know if that has anything to do with my memory. I am a senior at a University, but I only remember my notes short term enough to take a test then I forget it all. I want to be able to recall memories of my childhood. I sit and think hard, but nothing comes to my mind. My thoughts    are always jumbled up. Everyone knows I don't have a good memory, but only my mom and I know to what degree. I am mentaly stable and live a normal life, only problem is my memory. I hope I don't sound crazy, but I hope someone on this blog can give me an idea of what the problem is.	7	Memory loss	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

While memory loss is a common symptom of dementia, memory loss by itself does not mean that a person has dementia.Please stop by soon.Best,Cheryl	0	dementia,Memory loss,Alzheimers Disease,Neurology	Memory,Memory issues,people,confusion,App,skin infection,Memory loss,MRI,Panic Attack,neurologist,Helping,Headache,mental fog,Alzheimers Disease,Migraines,tiredness,Verbal,Neurology,alzheimer,complex migraines,test,dementia,tbi,Schizophrenia,Alzheimer's disease,brain,Tumor,tardive dyskinesia,weakness,

post_8293388	100	Memeory loss with IQ drop of 100 pts	1428	3236571	Sep 02, 2012	I was working a very stressful, complicated, heavy multitasking job dealing with two customers at a time, each within 15 minutes apiece, for 15 years. After a couple of years, I started developing dyslexia (never had it before), and gradual loss of memory. I coped with it for the next twelve years since needed the paycheck but finally completely blanked out at work. I have been out of work for a year and a half due to having a functional IQ of around 50 or less (Had 141 IQ in the military). I can only do one task to completion without interruptions or have to start all over now. All physical testing has been negative. Every neurologist, psychologist, psychiatrist I have talked to refuse to diagnose or assist me with my problem. I wasn't noticibly depressed when I first blanked out but after having been refused assistance by numerous doctors, frustration and depression is now developing. Can anyone help with a diagnosis or point me in the right direction for help. I live in San Antonio.
