post_2073349	Nov 07, 2007	192203	325705	resinlady	So sorry about your mom. It does sound if all of her tests are normal, that it could be the medication. When my husband was dying of cancer, his medications made him very confused and VERY paranoid. If there are no brain tumors, or blockage of the arteries, medications could be the culprit. Give it a few days off meds and see if she improves.	post_2072065
post_2084455	Nov 09, 2007	246850	None	None	I work in an Alzheimers unit, i will say that alot of the time when the meds are first started and patients are just diagnoised that It can go from worse to "better" When they figure out what works best and exactly whats going on with the patient than they can better treat. This disease will allow people to live longer and healthier on medication. I dont suggest going off for a few days only to satrt all over again. God Bless you and your family.	post_2072065
post_2104858	Nov 15, 2007	334105	None	None	It is possible that the paranoia and hallucinations could be related to some seemingly unrelated medication she received in the hospital. My wife experienced the same sort of thing in a rehab hospital after her stroke. I had ordered that she not receive any psychoactive meds without my OK and the hospital maintained that they had complied. Then one night just before I left her room they appeared with a unfamiliar med. I rejected it and she had her first nights sleep without the hallucinations. A check of the PDR turned up    hallucinations as a common side effect of the med. I'm glad I caught it because they were trying to get me to OK putting her on a anti psychotic med to treat the hallucinations.	post_2072065
post_2115536	Nov 17, 2007	144586	None	None	First of all, she has to be gotten off all medications. Being in a strange area can be very frightening to the elderly. Then, square two is to arrange for a family member to be with her constantly holding her hand for the next two weeks. Take your vacations. Rotate shifts. Don't give a darn about your jobs. The next time I hear about a "well reknowned physician" I am going to choke. She needs an endochrine screen from an endochronologist. If the "well reknowned physician" hasn't done this then I imagine he is well reknowned in Bosnia perhaps. Her sugar levels should be monitered. High or low sugar levels cause halucinations. They are called "sugar people". This should have been square one. They can seem very real. When she is off the meds    get an inexpensive glucose meter and take hourly readings. If your "well reknowned neurologist" has not done so, then perhaps he is actually well-reknowned in Zaire. He doies get points for "thinking it might be the medication".    The average first semester nursing student would have figured that out. And who prescribed the four medications simultaneously, Make sure that physician never goes near her again. After all is said and done, only after being cleared of medications and being given tender-loving care and human contact in familiar surroundings (which can be in a facility if a family member is there), can an evaluation of whether or not she actually has dementia or Alzheimers even be considered. Whenever a person has a life threatening situation a "lizardian" personality emerges. This has evolutionary survival value. Often, when the illness is treated the psychiatric issues disappear also. You have a difficult situation, but don't give up hope.	post_2072065
post_2177238	Dec 03, 2007	334557	325705	resinlady	My mother is going through something very similar.    She moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, after the death of my father, a year and a half ago.    However, her situation involves episodes of a dangerously high b/p and resulting in the same symptoms you describe in your mother.    She is not herself and keeps rearranging little accessories, etc.    She swings between laughing and crying.I know that UTIs can really through the elderly for a loop, just as you described.My Mom was doing exceptionally well on Zoloft after her diagnosis of moderate cognitive impairment but, developed severe gastic problems.    It was discontinued.    (Paxil, another, Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor did the same years ago).    Lexapro causes her to have hallucinations.    We are hoping that another antidepressant will be started soon.    It sure seems to help.    Mom said that she would even go through severe gastric pain again just to be feeling herself.    She is miserable, cranky and irritable right now.    Doctors are no good.    Meds are no good.    She is not happy.    There is confusion and she sometimes has false memory.She was also on Namenda but, again gastric upsets occurred.    We are waiting to introduce other meds.    You are fortunate to have such a good doctor to help care for your mother and monitor her closely.Unfortunately, we can all have side effects from medications.    Sometimes, we have to work through a few meds until we get it right.    I have experienced that myself and sometimes it just doesn't make sense until the right med is found.God bless you.    You are a good, caring daughter who loves her mother and wants the best for her.    She is very fortunate indeed.The one thing I would like to suggest, is testing by a neuropsychologist.    It usually takes an hour and a half.    Mom actually enjoyed the testing that involved manipulating various objects, stories, etc.    By being scored on different cognitive functions it helps to diagnose a patient or, verify a diaagnosis.    It proved extremely helpful when nothing abnormal showed up on the MRI, carotid scan and CAT scan of the head.I know this is a difficult time and you are doing all you can.    We aren't doctors and it is indeed a helpless, frustrating feeling not to be able to help our Moms and other loved ones.You could get a second opinion or perhaps call in a kidney specialist, too.Get rest, eat well and take care of yourself.    Okay?    Sorry this is going on for you, too.    Physical symptoms are easier to deal with than dementia.Much love,your friend	post_2072065
post_2567610	Feb 27, 2008	426039	325705	resinlady	My husband had a infection - his white count was at 36000 in june and no knew what was causing it.    They gave him antibotes. and Than July he had 56000 white count .    This time fever and the doctors thought it was anmonia and than urinary track infection but they didn't know for sure .    They wanted him to stop smoking and gave him medicine like Welbutern and he started to stare at the walls and stop in intersections, It went on for 5 years and Than he got worring about sleeping in when he had to go to work.    He got up every 15 min. to 1hr. ready for work. worrying about geting home.    worried about every thing plus weird things he did with ice cream and didn't seem to know how things work or like he    never saw it before.    etc.     Picks disease and being a fraid and worring was part of it.    I thought it was the welbutern years ago.    But it wasn't.    Arciept is the one that keeps him going and Namenda.    He started to break out on Arciept after two years and switched him to Execlon .    He went and lost the two years progress in one week.    I got them to put him back on Arciept and it took almost two months and now can do things again except he lost his writing.    I keep thinking the fevers or the meds back 7 years had something to do with the problems.    Picks will turn into Aztimers/sp    later.    Keep testing and get second opinions.    We went through 4 doctors and ended up with a good nerulogist that listens- by the way please write what you have seen her do and things you notice.    I wrote a    five year list of what happened from the infections and when the thing started to happen right after to the day of the appiontment.    That will give them something to go by. I wrote some minor things also.    every bit helps.rbcf	post_2072065
post_3024435	Jun 11, 2008	532802	325705	resinlady	Change can be extremely difficult for the elderly.    Just the change in her home situation could put her in a tailspin. I am sorry to hear she also had to be hospitalized with a UTI--another change of environment and I assume in a hospital where she had never been before.    It sounds like she needs alot of TLC.As for the medications, it sounds like the doctor is making too many changes all at once.    When my father's dose of Aricept was increased, the doctor waited several months before adding Nomenda.    He also takes Remeron.    Now a so-called geriatric pychiatrist wants to add another anti-depressant.    It appears that Dad might benefit from that, but it would make more sense to me to add it after he has been on Nomenda for awhile, so we know how he reacts to that before adding something else.    I don't know about your situation, but in ours, their are a number of different health care specialists involved.    One thing you can do is coordinate your mother's medication list with all of them and keep them up to date. This might help reduce the possibility of drug interactions.We are fortunate that we can be there to advocate for our parents.    Some elderly have nobody.    At the same time, we must take care of ourselves so we have the strength to be there both mentally and physically.    God bless you for all you do.	post_2072065

post_2050610	Nov 01, 2007	192203	319553	marie1983	You need to get your father to a dr right away. This sounds more like brain injury, possibly from the heart attack and lack of oxygen, However, whatever it is he needs a thouough evaluation. He also sounds like he is depressed.    Good luck and prayers to you, but please get him help as soon as possible.	post_2049425

post_2052178	Nov 01, 2007	312910	None	None	if its alzheimers and there giving meds it should stop the progression of memory lost but it does not cure what already was lost.    ones the damage is done it cant be repaired.    Is he getting worse or is his condition consistent when he was diagnose? Anyways he lacked memories of his life but does remember you as his daughter.    the best way sometimes to help people with limited memory is to retell them. repeat the memories that you remember with him hopefully happy ones.	post_2049425
post_2084500	Nov 09, 2007	246850	None	None	It DOES sound like Alzheimers. This can happen at any age. Medication is not gaurenteed to stop the progression of memory lost. Each person with this disease progresses differently. Medication can help but like i said there is no guarentee.When dealing with Alzheimers people, you must have patience. Getting "mad" to get them to do something is not gunna work, at least in the long run. Manipulation and "lying" often come in handy when dealing with this. once you figure out (or if you know) the significant things in a persons life you can start a conversation with them using these things. Agreeing often comes in handy. Its like working with a toddler in a way. In one of the first confrences i attended they told us that when you get this disease you lose everything you learned in life "backwards" you may go from walking and talking to crawling and chanting. (with everything in between) Its very tough and the most you can do for someone is be patient and love them. Prayer is powerful as well to help give them the best quality of life they can have.=)	post_2049425
post_2129331	Nov 21, 2007	315914	None	None	I agree it sounds like Alzheimers but he's so young !! I know it can happen at any age, but is there any family history? My G-grandmother, grandmother & father died of it. I think I'm screwed :-) Of course you hear so many things, it's runs on the mother's side, blah blah blah. I guess you just don't know. They tested my dad for it. I take they have done that for your dad? I think if they haven't I would want a cat scan done. And any other test to make sure there isn't brain damage from the heart attack. My dad was in his 70's when we found out but we finally had to put dead bolts on the doors to keep him in. Good Luck, my prayers are with you	post_2049425

I told the doctor for five years something was wrong and he wouldn't believe me and my husband got mad and said nothing was wrong.    We went to psychistist and he past their test and brain test., mri was the one which showed shrinkage of the frontal lobes but the neurologist in the one who caught it .    I wrote down all the things he did and when it started and took it and with test of making a clock,,and other test he figured out what he had and he is on Namenda and Arciept.    They took him off of Arciept and in one month he lost two years.    I got him back on and now he is doing most things again.    Writing and doing figures are now getting worse.    He had his 7 years.    he only went into this once every few weeks at first and after five years it was happening every few days.    So he was normal and than done things which he would never do ,{ dump garbage out in the street, didn't know how to vacum, lost things ,    put ice cream ing the microwave and left it there, stop in the intersection,    stared at walls, he would look lost and like he never seen something.    etc.rbcf	post_2049425

Dementia can often lead to Alzheimers later on, but is not gaurenteed. Ask her docter to give you more information about this. Your Family has my prayers.=)	post_2081694

I think my Mom is embarassed.    My Dad calls with updates when she is in her therapy.    I would feel better if we could openly talk about this, but I wouldn't hurt her or embrass her for the world.    Suggestions?Thanks againJudy	post_2081694
post_2093099	Nov 12, 2007	246850	None	None	About the only suggestion i have, is to get more information and training on the disease.

post_2156400	Nov 28, 2007	334557	328100	Judy23	Dr. Alzheimer had a colleague who was named Dr. Lewey.    Dr. Lewey made an important discovery as well.    He found that some patients had (Lewey) bodies which cause dementia as well.    Apparently there is a number of these diseases out there.At this point, my Mom has been diagnosed with non-specific dementia and is taking Namenda.A neuropsychologist can also help test brain function which is important to see which functions are impaired.    Those usually correlate with different types of dementia.Open communication is very important.    You need to know what is going on.    If your father has POA perhaps he can give permission for the doctor to call you as well.The most difficult thing for me is for the doctor to ask me questions about my mother in front of me.    I feel as if I am betraying her.    Your dad is good to give you updates.    Reassure both of them and just continue to be the loving daughter that you are.    Don't let dementia be the big elephant in the room that no one is talking about.All the best,ckr	post_2081694

Only married around 9 years and he has had it for 7 yr that I know and it come on once in awhile .     It could have been there with his other wife and which caused a lot of things.    change in personality and reasoning is the hardest for me.    Mad really easy and he was a very nice person.    Now will stand toe to toe and fight over anything.    Check out Dementa on the Web and You can get a good picture of what is going on. They done a test and had him draw out a clock and put the numbers in and to put the hands and give him a time.    He left out 12, hand ended up same length, and instead of 9;15 he put 9;05 He had pass all the other tests with only one wrong at the other places and that day he missed almost all.rbcf	post_2081694

I come from a fairly large extended family there are 10 cousins and we are all very close with each other.    Up until last night i had no idea what was going on. My dad was on the phone with his mom asking her if she was watching hockey but she was not answering and she only answered the phone hello and good you then mumbled something.    She can't seem to communicate with my grandpa and she won't talk beyond hello.    If you write something on paper she looks but doesn't say anything.    When you talk to her she looks at you with a blank stare. She fell down didn't get up for three hours and my grandpa was trying to get her up and all of a sudden she does it and sits back on the wall.     Prior she was saying that her foot hurt her a lot. What we thought was a stroke could it be late Alzheimer's??~sec	post_2331582

post_2283291	Dec 27, 2007	342507	327789	scotty2	sorry to hear about your mother. Your probably right about your dad wanting to remember her the way she was.    My aunt has Alz, my mom died 3 years ago and my dad 2, so she is the closest relative to me.    she was in a care center and they sent her to the emergency room yesterday, as she was non responsive, not alert, etc. Now she is in the hospital and from one day to the next she is worse, she just says the same thing over and over and doesn't respond, it is very scary, the doctors say they can't do anything but keep her comfortable, i hate when they say that.    Anyway, good luck with your parents, they will be in my prayers.	post_2242327

post_2359533	Jan 14, 2008	327789	264156	sugarpea013	Thanks to everyone.    My Dad seems to be doing OK, although he has always been a man of few words.    I think that maybe because they were in separate units and had not lived together    since last January it may be easier for him.    At least he is going to the dining room to eat again.    He had refused the first week.    Guess it all takes time.    Alz is such a terrible disease.    I used to talk to the nurses in my moms unit asking how they handled it.    One of the nurses told me she has a recurring nightmare that she is really not a nurse, but a patient there with ALZ.    I have so much respect to all who caregive Alz patients.    Not an easy task.	post_2242327
post_2347636	Jan 11, 2008	192203	381593	STmom	My mother has Alzheimers for quite a few years before she died. It is a progressive disease, she slowly became worse. I don't think what your are describing sounds like Alz. She may need to be    evaluated for a stroke.    What made them give a diagnosis of Stage 3? If she has been competent up until now, driving, knowing her family, etc. I would ask for a second opinion.Just my opinion. Please post how she is doing. Best Wishes.	post_2332406

post_2359111	Jan 14, 2008	381593	None	LLWB and Kelly42	Thanks for your advise.    My mom has a dr's appointment today and tomorrow.    They are trying to get her into John's Hopkins for a second opinion.    She hasn't been driving for a year now.    The last time that she drove she had an episode.    There was a friend with her and she didn't realize what had happened until they got back to the house.    My mom had lunch with this friend and they had left the house, went to lunch, got their hair done and came back to the house.    When they got inside my mom asked her friend if she was ready to go to lunch and her friend about freaked and told her that they had already gone and my mom told her she didn't remember.    They called my stepdad and then went to the doctor. She hasn't been behind the wheel since.One doctor that she has thinks it could be a side effect of the sleeping pill that she has been taking but doesn't want to take her off of it because she can't sleep if she does.    I think they need to find a new sleeping pill.They are trying to get her into some study at Johns Hopkins that scans your brain without having an MRI.    Guess we will have to wait and see what happens.Thanks again.	post_2332406

post_2298115	Dec 31, 2007	374944	343912	Pomegranate	Yes, I would suggest you sch. an appt. with her Doctor and determine if it is caused from medications or the onset of dementia leading to Alzheimer's disease. There are medications to hault the progression. Sounds like she should not be living alone and is regressing, Alz's destroys short term memory, thus she is remembering people and events of the past; long term memory.	post_2143076
post_2307795	Jan 03, 2008	375881	343912	Pomegranate	Well, by age of 90 at least 60% of people will have dementia. It usually starts in a subtle way that can be missed by close relatives in 25 % of the time. Things like personality changes, repeating themselves, irritability are not un common early changes. The doctor will run some tests to check for reversible causes of dementia like B12 deficiency, hypothyroidism, sub-dural hematomas; if all negative then a presumptive diagnosis of Alzeheimer's dementia is made. There is an excellent medicine in addition to Exelon called Namenda; it is a class by it self. Those medicines can slow down the progression up to one year but the overall decline is inevitable.Delusions can happen and can be controlled with medications but there is side effects.	post_2143076
post_2298095	Dec 31, 2007	374944	None	tan777	You can go to the Library for sources of the stages of Alzheimer's or contact the Alz's Assoc in Chicago.My Mother had Alz's for years and yes, it is very normal for the person with the disease to repeat themselves. Their short term memory is almost erased and they don't really remember asking the questions much less remembering if you answered. Because they eventually become bedridden they do have small/mini strokes. She actually can not remember how to chew or swallow or if she even ate of if she feels full. The disease destroys all motor functions one at a time. You need to read a book you can purchase on Amazon.com called the 35 hour Day. It explains the # of stages and what to expect.Any other questions of help I can be to you, please ask.	post_2283299

post_2172768	Dec 02, 2007	348504	351168	tjsangel87	Hi.Are these your MRI results? If yes, could you tell us what symptoms you experienced which led to an MRI being performed?Diffuse brain atrophy can be caused by many conditions and is not specific to any one of them. This is also true with small vessel ischemia seen on the MRI. One thing that was certain in your findings was no presence of any acute brain infarction (stroke).You should have a neurologist correlate this MRI findings with any symptoms you may be experiencing.Hope this helps.	post_2172662
post_2172825	Dec 02, 2007	351168	None	DrGodofredoMD	Hi,Thank you for your quick response.    No, these are the results of my mother-in-law's MRI.    We were told that in a past MRI that they did see an old stroke.    She suffers from depression and headaches.    I took her for this MRI b/c of headaches and the fear she may have had another stroke.She was diagnosed with Alzheimers and severe depression.    I was wondering if a stroke was causing some of her issues so we got the MRI done to rule out anything else.    She is 74 and was diagnosed about a year ago.	post_2172662
post_2172846	Dec 02, 2007	351168	None	DrGodofredoMD	I really need some guideance on the Alzheimer's.    I am going to be taking care of her and am just wondering what is in store for us ahead.    She goes in and out of what appears to be moments of total control to not being able to remembering how to write a check.    She started with hallucinations this summer and we didn't realize it until she went into more detail earlier this fall and told me that there were men in her room and she couldn't sleep.    She is now on Geodon, which has been a blessing.    We have no more late night visitors.My father-n-law passed away four years ago and ever since we have been living with her.    She now feels that she wants to live alone.    She forgets to pay bills and for a while couldn't rember how to make mac-n-cheese.    She cooks on rare occasions and makes the same thing over and over. I guess the recipe is something that stuck with her.I am scared to let her live alone, she calls me everyday at work for every little thing.    I don't mind...I am just worried she isn't able to live alone.    Is there any way to guage how far along she is in her disease?	post_2172662
post_2172892	Dec 02, 2007	348504	351168	tjsangel87	Hi.The disease progression in AD varies from person to person with a length of disease as short as 3 years to as long as 20. There are certain staging systems which provide guides to the pattern of the disease and would be helpful in making decisions regarding care.One staging system categorizes the disease as early, middle and late stages. The Global Deterioration Scale (Reisberg Scale 2), is another system that describes the disease progression in seven stages.Again it is important to emphasize that each person will have a unique presentation and progression of his/her disease. Symptoms may appear in any order and there is no clear line when one stage ends and another begins, with overlapping of stages occurring commonly.Also, an important thing to remember is that the focus should not be made squarely on what abilities are lost during disease progression, but also focus on the abilities that do remain, such as the senses of touch and hearing, and the ability to respond to emotion.Hope this helps. Good luck.	post_2172662

In the mid to later stages of Alz most patients do not remember family members, names, or even where they are or have been. Even when told these things, they usually ask again minutes later. Bless you for caring. Maybe you could make a visit, and see for yourself her condition. She may need some time to adjust to her loss.When my dad lost my mom after 50 years together, he never got over her loss. Sometimes we wish they could go together. Perhaps she needs visited by a home health nurse, or an assisted living facility for a time to help her get thru this.	post_2046212

post_1996173	Oct 18, 2007	192203	302861	daughter1966	I am so sorry for your mother's diagnosis. You don't say what stage they diagnose her as having. My Grandfather lived for 9 years in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. He was perfectly healthy otherwise. It was devasting for our family. He died in his late 70's. My mother started exhibiting early symptoms in her late 50's. Unfortunately she was also an alcoholic, and it caused her condition to go downhill. She had also had uterine cancer, and breast cancer. My dad had always promised to keep her at home and care for her. In her late 70's unbeknown to my brother and me, she become very ill. She was incontinent, didn't know anyone, and was almost catatonic. Neither my brother or I lived close by. I happened to go for a visit, and was appalled at her condition. She couldn't cook, find the heat thermostat, had night terrors. She was in late stages. At my insistance my dad took her to dr the next day. (He was in denial of her condition, kept insisting he could care for her). The doctor put her in hospital as she had horrific kidney infection. Of course they hooked her up to IV's, started antibiotics, etc. My brother and I immediately    gathered with my dad. Fortunately she had a living will, having anticipated her condition before she became medically incompetent. She requested no life sustaining measures,no feeding tubes, etc., not even IV's. We had them removed. It was one of the hardest things we will ever had to do, but it was her wish. When her infection was cured, my dad got ready to take her home. The doctor concurred with my brother and I, and she was placed in a nursing home. She didn't even recognize her husband of 49 years. My dad even suffered a heart attack several years earlier from the stress of caring for her. Unfortunately she wouldn't take the medications that could have prolonged her cognizent capabilities. There are better treatments now than when she first suspected she was ill. She only lived 3 months after being placed in nursing home. She got up one morning, ate a little, told the nurses she was tired and was going to take a nap. She went in, laid down, and died. The doctors had suspected she was getting close to the end, her feet were swelling, she was forgetting how to eat, and they suspected bowel cancer. Wanted to operate, which would have meant tyying down her hands to prevent her pulling out the catheters and IV's, which she had done when hospitalised for the kidney infection. All they wanted was the money. She had no quality of life at the end. I am so so sorry for you. But take heart, with treatment, if she is in early stages, she (in my guess) probably has several years if not more, if she is otherwise in good health. Please let me know what I can tell you to help make this easier for you. I know that's really not possible, but maybe it helps to know you are not alone. There are several good    groups that can help you to deal with this. Also, may I suggest, if she is still mentally competant, that you talk with her candidly, and ask her what she wants. I will pray for both your mom and you.Maggie	post_1995614
post_2290482	Dec 30, 2007	368886	373079	bryan03	Hello.Your father is showing signs of Dementia. I guess these symptoms are not sudden in onset.The atrophy is normal in this age. It is not there in each and every 80 year old person, but some amount of atrophy is normal.The isolated foci of hyperintensity are also normal provided he does not have any other symptoms.I would still suggest you to take a Neurologist's opinion on this. The symptoms of memory loss and confusion have to be investigated and appropriate steps have to be taken to prevent further damage. Dementia is progressive.Regards	post_2288398

post_2211099	Dec 09, 2007	348504	329402	hdink2	Hi.I am very sorry to hear that your husband is suffering from dementia. I do hope that his condition would improve.Dementia can exist in many conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal demential, and secondary dementias (also known as "reversible dementias" because the cognitive impairment resolves with treatment of the primary disorder). MRI may be helpful in some of these conditions but, most of the time, the diagnosis is a clinical one, and is mostly based on symptomatology and medical history. It would be advisable to sit down and talk to your neurologist about his condition to determine the prognosis as well as how to cope with the disease.Good luck.	post_2086744
post_2187595	Dec 06, 2007	350595	343532	valmart	Hello.A normal EEG does not rule our Dementia. In fact, for a definitive diagnosis of Dementia, an MRI of the brain and brain biopsy are necessary.Mild cognitive Impairement can be considered the initial stage of a Dementia process. The impairement is expected to increase with time. You need to consult her Neurologist, get an imaging study of the brain, and discuss treatment options.One cannot reverse the nerve cell death, but it can be arrested if appropriate steps are taken now.RegardsDrAbhijeetMD	post_2187465
post_2078107	Nov 08, 2007	325927	327047	Sandcastle53	Hi,You have not mentioned the cause of the dementia. I hope she has been worked up for the cause of dementia as that itself is important in deciding the treatment option. Presuming she is suffering from Alzheimer's, there are not many proven medical treatment options. Apart from what she is already on, few agents are being currently evaluated to assess the efficacy in reversing the progression of the disease. Aspirin, estrogen, vitamin E, selegiline, Ginkgo extract are potential treatment options but none is proven.	post_2077550

It was a terrible shock after years of infertility.    We have since had 3 further pregnancies - 2 miscarried and one diagnosed at 12 weeks with MKS.    It is unbelievable when you consider there is a 75% chance the baby will be OK.    So, at 43 years old I am 11 weeks pregnant and go for my scan and have bloods taken to search for MKS in a week and a half.    We are feeling very positive that this time the baby will be clear of MKS.It has been a tough 5 years but we have not given up.	post_2162699

post_3551977	Oct 20, 2008	649946	None	All	Wanted to share this, got it from a friendDear Mom and Dad,I wish that I could have said "good bye". Â  It sometimes seems unfair that I was never able to say "hello".I'm OK now; everything is better. Â  I miss you and always will, but I believe we will be together again, in time for all time. Â  Right now, though, that seems likely an eternity. Â  In time it will be for an eternity.Please, remember me, use my name, tell my family and your friends about me. Â  Never forget me or pretend I didn't exist. ÂThanks for all you done for me. Â  Mom, thanks for putting up with all of the changes in your body; Â  thanks for everything you shared with me. Â  Thanks for talking to me; Â  I know your hopes and dreams for me. Â  Thanks for the songs you sang, and for those gentle pats you gave me while I was floating inside you. Â  You may not realize it, but the rhythmic contracting helped me rest peacefully and reassured me. Â  As I grew I could feel your heart beating better and better, and it gave me such a wonderful sense of comfort.Thanks for tears you shed for me. Â  I know you did everything you could for me and I am fortunate to have you for my Mother. Â  I am sorry for the sadness and sorrow you have suffered.Dad, thanks for being there for Mom and me, it must have been so hard for you, trying to be so strong and brave for Mom, when you were confused, upset and afraid yourself. Â  I will miss growing up with you, wrestling, being tossed in the air, just sitting on your lap learning how to use the TV remote control. Â  Please don't ever forget about me. Â  I will never forget about you. ÂIf there is something that I have learned, is that you will not find the answer to the 'why' of all of this, not now anyway. Â  God did not make this happen, but He will help you live, love and laugh again. Â  Sometimes that can seem very difficult when you hurt and want so badly answers.I want you to live today; be happy. Â  Bring laughter back into the house. Â   Dare to dream again. Â  You know so much better than many that life is often so short and unpredictable. Â   Tomorrow is never guaranteed.I would rather this be all a very bad nightmare, but I can't do nothing to change that now. Â  However, you can make something good out of my death if you use it for an opportunity to love each other a little bit more, and reach out. Â  There are so many hurting people out there who need a hand, or a hug or a 'hello' or just someone to listen. Â  Don't be afraid to admit that you may be one of them. Â  Be gentle with each other.On a clear, still night, look for me out there in the peace and quiet. Â  Look up, not by the Big Dipper or the Milky Way, but over there in the corner of the sky. Â  See that small, twinkling you never noticed before?One more thing before I go, thanks a lot for everything you did for me. Â  Thanks for caring and sharing. Â  Thanks for trying and crying. Â  I love you lots. Â  And Mom and Dad, "good bye", "good bye for just a little longer."Love you	post_2162699

post_3654162	Nov 13, 2008	681752	None	All	My wife and discovered through our first pregnancy that we carried the Meckel Gruber recessive autosominal gene after our ultra-sound showed signs of this disorder in 2005. I understand what all off you who are first finding out about this are going through. It is tough. You dream of a natural order in your family life...get married...work hard...buy a house....and have some children. Finding out this sure put things out of order for me. I had a hard time with first losing our pregnancy and secondly admitting to myself that the next pregnancies could possibly fail as well with the 1/4 odds. Our next pregnancy was successful, we have a beautiful little 3 year old now. Then our third was diagnosed with this disorder and terminated in June 2008. That was still painful, but easier knowing what the syndrome was all about....we avoided all the genetic testing on the second diagnosis which reduced our efforts. We mustered up some strength this past few months and decided to get pregnant again (which, luckily we never seem to have a problem with). We are around 7 weeks and waiting for that 14 week ultrasound. Waiting is tough once you realize the odds and the time it takes to get a proper screen. I keep telling myself that the odds for are really quite good. I am not a betting man, but if you gave me those odds when betting on a sporting event I would bet my money on winning. I think for all of those who have had two diagnosis in a row you must be pretty discouraged. I encourage you all to take care of yourselves in your time of grief. Have some down time, enjoy your partner, engage in your supports (community/friends), seek counselling to identify your emotions, and most of all enjoy the present.	post_2162699

Her daughter just turned a year old. I have been reading and have not found much info about children surviving this disease, but I am hoping that someone can direct me somewhere.

post_4505756	May 27, 2009	792993	None	all	I am pretty sure it's not a misdiagnosis. It isn't 100% fatal there is some resreach online that talks about children who live........including this excerpt from the internet journal of anesthesiology     "Meckle-Gruber Syndrome [MKS] is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an estimated incidence range of 1: 9000 1 to 1:135, 0002. It is associated with occipital encephalocele, hypoplastic kidneys, polydactyly, cleft lip or palate, mandibular micrognathism, anatomical abnormality of the larynx and the tongue, and several other associated malformations including cardiac defects 3 . These patients usually die shortly after birth; those who survive have less severe deformities 4 ."

post_4795296	Aug 22, 2009	1013382	None	Hi everyone	I have just had to make the painful decision to terminate my pregnancy for a second time due to the Meckel Gruber syndrome. My husband and I discovered we had this gene with my first pregnancy at 20 weeks and knowing the disease is 100% lethal decided to terminate the pregnancy. We had hope (and still do) but my second pregnancy ended the same way...only this time at 13 weeks. :( It's really not easy to cope with and understand why this could happen to all of us, but I'm glad to have this network to communicate with. We are waiting the recommended 3 months and then will be trying again....I strongly believe it is just a matter of time for all of us! Good luck to all and don't give up!	post_2162699
post_5453950	Mar 10, 2010	1240295	None	everyone	HiAt 20 weeks of gestation we got recaled for our ultrasound because they had seen problems with our child. When we got there they discovered that he had possibly Meckel-Gruber syndrome. We were devastated as they said he would probably die in utero and if he did get to term he would die shortly after. They suggested abortion. We decided to keep our child and give him the chance to die on his own. They did all kind of genetic research and it all lead to the same conclusion that he would die soon. The pregnancy went well despite all that and at 37 weeks I gave birth to a breached child that we named Jacob. He lived for 16 minutes, the best minutes of our lives. He had all the symptoms of a Meckel-Gruber child but in our eyes he was the most beautiful baby ever. We do not regret our decision to let him live.	post_2162699

We were told by our doctors "Don't worry, it won't happen again." We are now pregnant again, 12wks, and I am terrified that our family will have to go through this again. Laylah was our 3rd child, and so far, the only child affected. We are now learning that we have a 25% chance of this pregnancy ending the same way, how could we not have known? We see our Maternal Fetal Specialist in a week and I'm not sure where to start with the questions. I am so completely terrified, I know I won't make it through another stillbirth.    Anyone with any information or questions I should be asking would be greatly appreciated.	post_2162699
post_5464051	Mar 12, 2010	1243656	None	None	we had a healthy son in 02' and we got pregnant again in 04' and found out in wk 3 it was not a "normal" pregnancy...at 26 wks we induced labor so that our Peyton could not pass inside me and I could be harmed.    He lived for 2 minutes in December 2004. We decided to take a risk and try one more time 3 years later and we did get our Faith in God restored when we were blessed with our daughter in 08'.    She did have a kidney issue, a sign of meckyl-gruber and had to have it removed, but she did survive and is currently a healthy 2 year old.    We took the risk that our 1 in 4 was our first son, but we had to try and we are so glad we took the risk because she brings so much to our lives. And everyday she reminds me of Peyton because of him, that is how we named her, Faith in god that we could have another healthy child.	post_2162699
post_5704830	May 20, 2010	1320630	None	None	Hi Everyone,My little baby girl was just delivered at 18 weeks due to a severe encephalocele and missing parts of her brain.    They told me that I was putting myself at risk of uterine rupture and even death if we carried the pregnancy any further.    They suspect Meckel Gruber but don't know yet.    Initially there doesn't appear to be any kidney malformations and their wasn't any extra fingers or toes.    Does anyone know if these things are "necessities" for diagnosis?    How long does diagnosis take? We are painfully awaiting the results of the testing and just want to know why our baby girl did not make it.	post_2162699
post_6075708	Aug 27, 2010	1427210	1320630	NHMomma1980	Hi so sorry to read your news. My husband and I have had 5 children 2 of whom had MGS. We were advised by our consultant that MGS babies present in many different ways and therefore a postmortum is the only sure way of getting a proper diagnosis. Both our girls who died looked very similar but did not both have extra digits on hands and feet one had on hands only and the other on hands and feet. Both looked pear shaped in the body and had a slight opening in the skull where some brain matter was able to come out. If I can be of any help please do not hesitate to contact me today is the 17th anniversary of our first baby's birth and death.	post_2162699

We are part of a study through the Mayo Clinic which will hopefully be able to tell us exactly what genes we gave her to cause this condition.    I am hoping the results of the test will prevent her from having to be tested after her death.	post_2162699
post_6238992	Oct 12, 2010	1472668	None	None	My husband and I are carriers. We delivered a perfect son in 1979. But on Christmas Day in 1981 with no warning we delivered our 2nd son with MGS, He had a large encephalocele, polysistic kedneys, cleft palate, blind, no extra toes and fingers, normal sex, his ears were low and his eyes were close together. But he was a fighter, he lived for 2 years and 18 days. He took his bottle for 1 year and then just stopped. I had to tube feed him the rest of his life. He was my soldier. 10 years later I had a beautiful healthy girl, with no MGS. There is always hope. My daughter has had a son with no MGS and my son has had a daughter with no MGS.	post_2162699
post_6279492	Oct 23, 2010	1484456	None	All	Wow, so much has changed since we had our first MGS pregnancy in 1984. No internet, no information (besides what the perinatologist was able to find in a nedical journal) but more importantly, no support system such as what is now available. In the '80s, ultrasounds were not routine so when our obstetrician said he recommended an optional ultrasound at 26 weeks "just to make sure everything was normal" we were just thinking about whether the baby would be a boy or a girl. After much thought, advice and prayer, we terminated the pregnancy by delivery, just to make sure we had made the right decision (since MGS is always fatal). We miscarried again in '86, thankful in a way we didn't have to go through the horrible process of testing and delivering a MGS baby. The positive is that we have two healthy daughters, now aged 19 and 23. Knowing that they have a 50% chance of being carriers of MGS and only a 25% chance of not being a carrier, I am very thankful for a community such as this if, heaven forbid, they have to go through such a horrible experience. May God bless and comfort you all.	post_2162699
post_6319923	Nov 04, 2010	1496181	None	None	My husband and I are both carriers of MKS.    I delivered by c-section at 37 weeks. Garrett was born with a very large occipital encephacele.    He was born with 1 kidney, his heart was midline(as was his kidney) and he had biliary artresia.    When he was born he weighed 6lb9oz after they removed the encephlacece he weighed 4lb10oz.    The doctors remarked that it was the largest one they had ever seen.    They sent it to the Mayo Clinic for examination.    It was mostly cerebral fluid and cells.    His head was small.We brought Garrett home after two weeks.    He lived 10 years.    He was diagnosed at 2 with cystic fibrosis also and he developed a seizure disorder.    My husband an I have had very extensive genetic testing as did Garrett. He never got any bigger than a 2 year old..he never spoke..he couldn't walk..he was my baby for 10 years.    Garrett loved his toys sitting in my lap rocking...and music...he was a blessing.I know that MKS is compatible with life because Garrett lived.Everyone is talking about 25% chance of reacurrance...it's true... first son Mason died at 3 days old...but I have a beautiful 16 year old daughter(my middle child).    I'm not having anymore children; but I worry about my daughter and what this means for her...she is a carrier of MKS and Cystic Fibrosis...I have alot of information and would love to share.	post_2162699

Dustin and I got married on July 17th 2010... shortly thereafter we were soooooo happy to learn that we were expecting.. it was september 25th and I was about 8 weeks at that time... this was the 1st pregnancy for both of us. So, the 1st ultrasound went okay... a few months later... they said "It's a boy!" and the next day they called me at work and said his kidney's looked "Enlarged".... we went to a specialist an hour away and that's when we were told that he has a 95% chance of "Meckel Gruber", he has 6 fingers and toes and his kidney's took up his entire abdomen... we've pretty much been in shock since then.... our very first child, our son, is not going to survive in this life, with us. But, we have faith in God and understand that there is a path for all of us, this is a major, if not, the most important choice for us to make... it may not be the right one, but we have decided to terminate this pregnancy... our son will not survive with these kidneys.... he will most likely make it 15 minutes (not one human diagnosed with Meckel Gruber has ever survived), the kidneys are so large, there isn't room for the lungs to grow, it just isn't possible... there is no medication or miracle that can fix this. We have a 25% of this happening again and well, we just might take that chance one day. I have tried to be brave and read the stories from others like us, and it has made me stronger and more hopeful. I really love going on Facebook and I was hoping to find a support group on there, I didn't, so I made one.... please join, thanks!http://www.facebook.com/home.php?sk=group_120017861401125	post_2162699

post_7814711	Mar 29, 2012	2094616	None	None	At 20 weeks, my son was diagnosed with Meckel Gruber.    We have decided to carry to term.    For these parents who say their children have lived for years with MKS, I'm curious what type of treatment your child had after birth?    All of the research and all of the doctors we have met with have told us that it is 100% fatal, and that our little boy will live only a few minutes, hours, or days.    According to the doctors, there is no study of a child living past 18 months.    So, if it is true that your children have MKS and are still living, why aren't there studies written about them?    I feel like maybe you are giving us parents with MKS children false hope, or that something is wrong with us because your children have lived while ours are dying.	post_2162699

post_2323110	Jan 06, 2008	379666	368733	stevesdh	No.    To pass things on genetically one must transfer DNA from ones germ (sperm or egg) cells.    Alcohol is unlikely to cause mutations in the DNA contained in germ cells; in fact, I don't think alcohol is much of a mutagen at all in any cells!Any genetic link to alcoholism must have existed preexistingly and is passed down to offspring.    However, if their is a genetic link within a family, I imagine that if the family has a predisposition to alcohol and are alcoholics, the children are more likely to be alcoholics than a genetically identical family that doesn't drink (environmental factors).	post_2322745

The most impossible model is both genetic factor and environmental factor play part in developing myopia.But the next concern is "Do you have any other abnormalities beyond myopia?" Some genetic diseases and syndromes have myopia as a characteristic feature, such as Marfan Syndrome, a rare genetic diseases which patients are usually tall, thin, curved spined, sever myopia and can develop heart problem. So first, you should visit doctor and ask him are you likely to have any specific diseases or not? If the answer is no, you just think that myopia is complex, gentic and environment factors.Is that help?Dr Prasithttp://clinicalgenetics.blogspot.com	post_2114225

post_2745126	Apr 06, 2008	187722	332078	dustinsue	Since your sister has been diagnosed with MEN1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia 1), then look on the web site for the National Institute of Health and click on their Health section/site.    This genetic disease has several clinical trials where you can be tested for free.    I have hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid hyperplasia, facial angiofibromas, high blood pressure, kidney stones, etc.    I signed up for clinical trial with Dr. Stephen Marx and our daughter is also developing the same health problems that I have experienced.    Don't worry about your children until after you have been tested.    If you are searching for infomation, then look at www.webmd.com, the National Institute of Health, etc.    You might also want to download an Internet search site: www.copernic.com for free.    This has really helped me find additional information.    Good luck!	post_2107142

Yes, U should be tested, if u do not have it your children won't.    Just b-cause your sister has it, does not mean that you do.    Sometimes, only one sibling is, i will say attacted by this dreadful disease.The things u should look for is, calcium, have your blood calcium checked.    If it is high, even slightly, CALCIUM-never ever should be high.    Have your PTH (Parathyroid checked)...MEN 1 hits usually the 3 P's (Pancreas, parathyroids and the pituitary gland.I myself since I turned 40, have had all my parathyroids out and in the same year the tail of my pancreas.I had a chromogranin A blood test done-by an Endocrinologist that specializes in MEN1, since it effects your endocrine system.    and that is a marker for tumors, in Sept of last yr, mine C-test, was 475    high some, then again in Dec same blood test, it was 1785 (but they can't find the tumor yet, must b 2 small or it is a lymphnoid problem, which I really hope it isn't.I can tell u that I know longer work, which I always have, I became disabled at 41 and have been going to counseling suggested by my DR's and now see a physcrist.    it helps, but it will always be there,    I have MCD/GAD, major chronic depression and general aniexty order.    Life ***** for me, but 4 U, U maybe one of the lucky ones, not every hospital does the genetic testing.    I had to go to another city in my state.    then they send it to Yale University and it takes several months to process.    PLEASE< check into the test, the tumors can become malignant.    Hopefully u will be diagnosed no, and your children will not have to go through the testing.    If you r, then yes they do.    U have to act on this NOW.Think about your parents, which one has the MEN 1?    Look at your ancestery of the person that has it and there side of the family.    Look for Abdominal problems, brain tumors, cancer, thyroid problems, kidney stones, muscle aches/pains, Lost Weight....for no none reason.    Being anemic, out of no where.Dr. Norman out of FL, check him out, I believe he was the one that found the disorder and has a lot of info.    I hope this helped u, and Please for the sake of U especially and your siblings/children/family go get checked-or at least get your calcium checked, PTH and Pituatary (blood work can confirm and there are other tests, if u have questions mail meGood luckLinda	post_2107142

post_2802766	Apr 19, 2008	217626	None	None	I also have EDS type 3 and I have MVP. I haven't heard of a connection between us and CV issues but our collegen is weak everywhere in our bodies so anything is possible. I am a patient at the NIH study and have learned that there is an association between EDS and FMD (Fibromucular Dyplasia)    FMD is where the arteries take on a beaded appearance. The arteries become very narrow and strokes can happen. These arteries can be repaired so they must be watched closely.You had mentioned that there is a study stating that 20% of EDSers may have CV issues. I would think that there is at least 20% of the non EDS community that would have some type of Cardio Vascular issus as well.Frequent check ups are important for all of    us. Just because we have EDS type 3 doesn't mean that we can't have symptoms of the other forms.    An EDS type 3 patient could still get aneurysms like a VEDS patient.    An EDS type 2 (classical) could still have dislocations.    Get well informed and make sure your doctors are also well informed.	post_2145451

Francomano1,2. 1) National Institute on Aging, NIH, Baltimore, MD; 2) Harvey Inst Human Gen, Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Baltimore, MD.The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. Vascular dissections and aneurysms are a cardinal feature of the vascular form of EDS (VEDS) caused by mutations in COL3A1. Loeys-Dietz syndrome, a closely related phenotype, is caused by mutations in TGFBR1 or TGFBR2. We have identified a group of patients without mutations in COL3A1, TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 who presented with arterial dissections and aneurysms as well as stenotic lesions with a diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) by pathology or radiology. Varying features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, such as atrophic scars, velvety or stretchy skin, joint hypermobility as evidenced by a high Beighton score, history of articular dislocations, uterine prolapse, joint pain, pectus deformities, pes planus and scoliosis were also present. Several of the patients had a family history of premature death from vascular events, as well as a family history of joint and skin abnormalities compatible with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. There were no reports of uterine or bowel rupture, or pregnancy related death in personal or family histories. The facial features were not characteristic of VEDS or Loeys-Dietz syndrome. The first patient identified was a 44 year old woman who had a history of carotid dissection, ruptured cerebral aneurysms, FMD of renal arteries and iliac vessels, multiple atrophic scars, frequent joint dislocations, and stretchy and doughy skin. A cohort of thirty patients with this syndrome has been identified and detailed phenotype and family history information has been assembled. The etiology of fibromuscular dysplasia is thought to be heterogeneous, with genetic and environmental factors proposed as possible contributors. Our findings suggest that there is a previously unrecognized variant of EDS, distinct from the VEDS and Loeys-Dietz syndrome, with FMD as a major clinical feature in addition to the skin and joint abnormalities.

(otherwise its just bad luck);-) I have seen a geneticist regarding suspected neurofibromatosis but this has now been disregarded as a possible explanation. Iâ  m female and 21.I wanted to ask others with knowledge on the EDS what they thought, I am not particularly flexible, and wondered if all people with EDS are overtly flexible as I know there is more then just one classification of itâ  â  ..?I thought the best thing to do would be to list the problems/ characteristics I have and see what you experts think? Maybe Iâ  m just grabbing at straws.Thanks BeckieHullax valgus feet from birth. Both dislocate easily.Idiopathic scoliosis.

post_2829099	Apr 25, 2008	328145	None	None	Hi,Try going on ENDF.com to look up profile of the different subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos.    Some medical articles have a list of related DX's for a differential diagnosis.    (making sure it isn't a related syndrome).    Much of it sounds like something on the collagen spectrum of disorders.    There are other physical symptoms which is part of the diagnosis,,,, yours are something to suspect when looking at these disorders.    So look there.    Otherwise, I am no doctor.    (My guess is that the cancer is just being "lucky" and unrelated to the rest.)	post_2145451

post_3436424	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	Bethanyatg and Sandy Sandy	Hi Bethany/SandyVery interesting.    I have been looking into this myself, as both my aunt (age late 50s) and myself (45) were diagnosed officially as HEDS.However, a few weeks ago my aunt had a major vascular emergency (burst artery!) and nearly died.    As she bruises very extensively, I immediately thought "OMG! VASCULAR EDS!"I told her to inform the hospital vascular team about this possibility, and she has since seen our EDS specialist (Professor Grahame).    He is sending her to be tested for VEDS, but this will take some time.I thought that types ran true in families, but I am very much type III, so how does that work if she turns out to be vascular type?!This made me consider the possibility that HEDS and VEDS could have some crossover symptoms.    Like you both say, our tissues are fragile, so I suppose there is always the possibility that we could have a vascular episode.    Like you say Bethany, we need to be aware.I personally have had some symptoms which could be bleeding in the brain, or something similar, so am seeing a neurologist to get some of my scary symptoms checked out (so important now that this has happened to my aunt).If we find out any more we should keep in touch!	post_2145451
post_3438840	Sep 22, 2008	328145	None	None	My daughter went to her yearly geneticist visit..    Since she always gets slight bruising on her thighs... for no reason, seemingly... the dr. thought she should be tested for EDS II (the mild form of the classical type).    She said it was a small chance but would be good to know.    It turned out negative.    So there is cross-over in symptoms but I think it is due to the way the types are delineated rather than actually being a different type.    It's just the nature of the "game".I hope you don't prove to be the vascular type, jawsUK.    If it is any comfort to you, most EDS's with the vascular type don't live past their 3rd or 4th decade.    So your aunt doesn't look as though she fits the profile and you are nearly there.    However, the burst artery certainly is suspicious of being EDS related.    Did you know that in families the same form of EDS is passed down but the level of severity that presents in each person with it is individual?    So just because your aunt had a burst artery, you should be watched but it doesn't mean your life will follow in the same fashion.    Good luck.	post_2145451

This, however, is not a common occurance.	post_2039472
post_3187775	Jul 22, 2008	568315	316958	Kim2424	HI Kim,I am a 35 year old female with Marfan's syndrome. I was diagnosed at the age of 5. I have been having PVC"S for the past 8 years and up until a month ago they really didn't bother me much. However, last month I had severe PVC's that thru me into a panic attack and tachycardia and ended up in an ambulance headed to the ER. My regular cardiologist changed my betablocker to Metoprolol, and I have been doing some better. Still getting them on a very regular basis and they are starting to affect my activity. As far as the link between marfan's and PVC's I am not sure, I just thought I would put my 2 cents in. It is scary when the big one's come, my Dr. reassures me that they are not life threatening but I just cant convenience myself. I have had several family members with marfan's and all died at young ages in their 30's and 20's. I take this thing very seriously, and probably sometimes overreact and cause myself more harm. But, I have two small children and I worry about them and my health. Hope you are doing well, I would be interested in knowing how you are doing now, seems it was last october when you posted your question, and if you have found any more answers.	post_2039472

post_2323144	Jan 06, 2008	379666	350442	Jlisa	Hi Jlisa,I read up a bit on this one because it was an interesting question.    In this case, I think it wouldn't make much of a difference because a)The genetic inheritance of lupus among populations is low b)The inheritance isn't entirely concordant(that means, environmental or external factors also play a role, c)Your population size is high, thus having a high degree of variation d)Lupus involves more than one gene and e)You already know what it is and are looking to explain clinical manifestations.However, just in case these neurological effects are due to something unrelated to lupus, it might be useful to inform your doctor of your lineage and whether any of your other family members display or have displayed similar symptoms.    Truth be told though, the average family practitioner is probably unlikely to spot or look for a genetic link (and it would likely be unwise to do so), unless your family members have experienced similar symptoms.    So it is probably unnecessary in this case; it is probably a good thing to tell them anyways as you never know when your inheritance will come in handy in the future.	post_2170960
post_2451975	Jan 31, 2008	219373	None	jlisa	do not know if you will check this anymore but, you should ABSOLUTELY tell your doctor about your ethnicity.    there are several genetic defects associated particularly with ashkanazi jewish descent, these are paticular to your ethnic group (some of these are deadly conditions such as Tay Sacs and some blood disorders).    he may recommend additional testing for you and your unborn children and may need to prepare for certain problems if you do decide to have children.    i am not a doctor but i did go to medical school and i would advise you should always disclose EVERYTHING about you, your background, your habits, etc. to ANY doctor.    doctors can only help you if they know as much as possible.    you may think there is something a doctor does not need to know, but sometimes the most minute thing can be important.    although lupus is not known to be genetic, there are other important things the doctor may need to know.	post_2170960

I know that the factor V help explains why I had the mysterious MI 3 years ago, ( I was an otherwise healthy 28 Yr old woman).    I do have a family history of early cardiac events. I was placed on folic acid for the MTHFR and was already on ASA due to the MI (that was the treatment that doc stated would be for the FVL).    Do you know of anyother complications for the MTHFR, except the birth defect issue?	post_2337053

Sometimes these things can skip a generation and show up later.    Also, it could show up as something different but still in the same family so to speak. For instance, Autism, Dyslexia, ADD or ADHD and Tourettes Syndrome are sort of in the same Family but each is different or can be in combination such as Autism with ADD or ADHD. I am not saying that the person you mentioned as being retarded has any of these, just using it as an example. You may have nothing to worry about.    I would try to find out if there is anything back in the family -- genetics .    That in itself may be almost impossible as that sort of thing may be a family secret .PJ	post_2084048

post_2400976	Jan 23, 2008	16661	357702	juliannaspring	Hello...get a second opinion. There are some people who have the same genetic problem who show no sypmtoms to other family members who are affected. That is because since the duplicate would be on one x chromosome, the other good x may kick in more or less. So if there is say 75%-100% of that good chromosome and the other is supressed, you would not show any symptoms. There are other genetic conditions that work like this, like Rett Syndrome which my daughter has. BTW RS has many of the symptoms you describe so if you haven't had her tested specifically for it, you should. But the duplicate chromosome problem may be the culprit.	post_2218355
post_2338936	Jan 09, 2008	382927	339450	frgwtchr	Search for a Genetics Center in your area, or nearby.    Tell them you would like to have genetic testing done, emphasizing "Krabbe's Disease".    I don't know what that disease is or if they can test for it, but they should be able to answer that.    They can also test for many other chromosome abnormalities that might cause problems during pregnancy.	post_2125863

post_2080982	Nov 08, 2007	264002	None	None	Dear kfdbuddy,I am sorry to hear about your situation. There are a couple of reasons why the CVS (chorionic villi sampling) test may not have identified the presence of an extra chromosome in your daughter.First is a technical reason. The villi are snuggling in to the mother's uterus to form the placenta at 10-12 weeks of pregnancy. The villi typically have the same genetic makeup as the developing baby. When the villi are sampled, some of the tissue from the mother gets sampled as well. There is a chance that the villi are missed completely and only mother's tissue is sampled. Also, the villi and the mother's tissue look very different under a microscope, and the lab will remove the mother's tissue. If for some reason the mother's tissue is not completely cleaned up, there is a small chance that the genetic analysis really reflects the mother and not the developing baby.The second reason is biological. Sometimes the errors in cell division that cause a baby to have an extra chromosome happen after the baby has already started to develop. The developing tissue-baby, umbilical cord, and placenta, might end up with    different mixes of chromosomes. This is called mosaicism. It is not common, but it is possible that the villi could be normal 46,XX and the baby be 47, XX+13.Please discuss this with your healthcare provider. He or she can talk to the lab that did the testing. The lab should be able to review their records and provide an analysis of how they processed your sample. Some labs keep the original test slides that will contain the DNA from the sample on it, and they may be able to compare that DNA to yours and your daughter's. This will answer whose tissue was tested at the time of the CVS, and determine if some kind of mosaicism happened.Best wishes to you.	post_2066566
post_2210775	Dec 09, 2007	357435	324104	kfdbuddy	Sorry to hear that your baby girl was born with trisomy 18.    Many years ago I had genetic counselling after two miscarriages - one with trisomy 18.        THen I had an amnio with my next pregnancy.     My daughter was born with Cystic Fibrosis.    At the time CF could not be diagnosed with an amnio.Our life certainly changed, but I learned to adjust.    I found that what used to be important (like keeping up with the Jones) - was no longer a priority.    Our life is different than what we expected but so much richer by loving our daughter(for a long as she may live)    and by knowing the doctors, nurses and other parents of children with Cystic Fibrosis.I hope you and your family can make the best of this unexpected situation.

post_2081092	Nov 08, 2007	264002	None	None	Both CVS and amniocentesis have pros and cons. CVS (chorionic villi sampling) is done earlier in pregnancy, about 10-12 weeks, so the information that it can give you is received at a much earlier date in the pregnancy. This is incredibly important for some individuals, particularly if they have higher than average risks. CVS may have a slightly higher miscarriage rate than amniocentesis, and if done before 10 weeks of pregnancy, there may be an association with an increased risk of fetal limb defects. CVS does not test for open neural tube defects. Additionally, there is a very small but real chance that the CVS results cannot be fully interpreted and an amnio is needed to clarify results, or a error in cell division happens after the fetal and villi tissue have separated, and the CVS result doesn't completely represent the fetal genetic makeup. Rare, but again on the list of things to know about.Amniocentesis is done later in pregnancy, about 15-18 weeks. It has a slightly lower risk of miscarriage than CVS. It is testing skin cells that have sloughed off the developing baby so is more of a direct genetic test than CVS. It also looks at alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the amniotic fluid, and if needed, will look at an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (ACHE). Those tests combined will diagnose about 98% of open neural tube defects (spina bifida). CVS cannot provide that information, but ultrasound technology has advanced to the point that individuals who have CVS typically have a blood AFP done and a targeted ultrasound to determine if spina bifida is a concern.I hope that helps.	post_2021250

The radiologist or other expert responsible for the equipment used for your X-rays should be able to calculate out the amount of radiation you received.

Positive (+) is dominant over negative (-), so by the fact that you are negative, we know you are -/-. You only have a - to pass on to your children. Because one daughter is also negative, we know that her father is +/-.    Therefore there is a 50% chance for each child to receive the + gene and be positive.	post_2042182

post_2081015	Nov 08, 2007	264002	None	None	Dear mogbert,You described a number of issues, and none definitively point to a single inherited syndrome. According to OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) ear tags can be seen in over 20 different syndromes. To understand if an inherited syndrome applies to you, which one it is, how it can manifest itself in various family members, and what the chance is you could have children with the same syndrome, I recommend that you see a local medical geneticist. This healthcare provider can do a physical exam specifically to look for genetic syndromes that a routine physician may overlook and provide you with comprehensive information about what they find. The American College of Medical Genetics is a great place to find a local geneticist.	post_2065841
post_2080942	Nov 08, 2007	264002	None	None	Dear Jenbug,MTHFR is one of the most confusing areas of genetics today. The literature is all over the place on what it means. Some researchers have found definite correlations with miscarriage and other health concerns, and others have not been able to verify those results.Part of the issue is likely due to the fact that the MTFHR enzyme is just one piece of a very large biochemical pathway that regulates homocysteine levels. Not all the parts of this pathway are clearly understood yet, and not all of the genetic variants in that pathway have been identified. Additionally, vitamin and other "environmental" factors influence the levels of homocysteine, so it is not constant and can change over time. Vitamin levels can change over time as well. That makes it difficult to know for sure how MTHFR mutations (which are constant and don't change over time) are impacting a person at any particular moment.I am sorry that you have to deal with this confusion-many healthcare providers use the MTFHR mutation information as an interesting piece of information that may help explain clinical problems, but typically they will use homocysteine and vitamin levels to help identify what to do about it.I hope that helps clear things up a bit!	post_2068377
post_2080910	Nov 08, 2007	264002	None	None	Congratulations on your new granddaughter. I am sorry that this joyous time has a big question mark hanging over it.The Quad test is a screening test. This means that it cannot diagnose Down syndrome, but can identify people who may be at higher risk for having a baby with Down syndrome and offer them diagnostic testing, such as an amniocentesis. The test is correctly positive in about 75-80% of pregnancies with Down syndrome. The ratio of 1:9 means that 1 in 9 pregnancies with the lab values identified in your daughterâ  s test will have Down syndrome. Therefore 8 of 9 pregnancies, or about 88%, of pregnancies with this result will NOT have Down syndrome.Best wishes to you and your family.	post_2072609

However, having dizygotic twins does run in families and happens more frequently after the second pregnancy.

post_1877675	Sep 11, 2007	142791	269970	oh well	If you have a postiive ANA result, you could have an autoimmune disease. The test does not tell you which autoimmune disease you might have. In addition, 25% of CFS patients' and 29% of fibromyalgia patients' have a positive ANA titer as well.ESR (AKA: sed rate) checks for inflamation(inflammation)in your bodyRPR - checks for syphillis(syphilis). However, if you have lupus and a number of other health conditions, you can get a false positive lab result. Physicians' sometimes order this test not to check for syphillis(syphilis), but to help rule out other conditions.RF - Is order to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's Syndrome. I read recently that 18% of fibromyalgia patient's also have a positive RF.HLA B27 - This test is ordered sometimes when a physician believes you may have an inflammatory autoimmune disease.ACE - This test is often ordered to help diagnose sarcoidosis and other health conditions.	post_1869094
post_2254754	Dec 19, 2007	350595	366339	tasso	Hello.What you have described can be termed as "Cognitive deficits", and not purely memory problems. Cognition is a collective term for memory, reasoning power, etc.Your Psychiatrist wants to rule out the possibility of Dementia. Such symptoms are seen in Dementia, too. However, it is likely that these syptoms(symptoms)are a result of your Depression.Regards	post_2253851
post_2359688	Jan 14, 2008	378461	366339	tasso	I too have experienced exactly what you have described and I am 34 years old. What struck me in particular about your post was the following statement:"experiences during the day, when recollected, seem discrete and unconnected - i.e., can't quite recall when such and such happened or whether it was today or yesterday." I had a hard time putting in words what you just did.I have been on 20mg Lexapro for over 7 years now. I had these issues while on the medication but do worse "mood" wise if I am off them. I think it is wise that your Dr. is ruling out other possibilities. If everything comes back clear, I suspect the medication may be playing a role in this. I have seen other posts on these forums describing similar symptoms after starting anti-depressants.	post_2253851
post_8228648	Aug 11, 2012	3180207	None	None	there are dissociative disorders that cause memory issues and cause you to forget things.if there is abuse in your history including mental, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse i would say that you should look into a dissociative disorder.a dissociative disorder is a way of coping and your brain "checks out" and it causes you to forget things.most psychiatrists don't catch on and it goes undiagnosed.good luck.	post_2253851
post_2152069	Nov 27, 2007	338187	None	None	Hi.How old is your mother now? Has she recently experienced emotional distress or very strenuous physical activity? Does she have a history of migraines? What about cardiovascular disease?There is a condition called transient global amnesia wherein there is a sudden onset of loss of memory with retention of one's personal identity in spite of the amnesia. The person suffering from transient global amnesia has no symptoms that can be attributed to brain damage, no seizures, and has normal cognition. TGA lasts for less than 24 hours with gradual memory return.Aside from strenuous physical activity and emotional distress, it can also be caused by sudden immersion in cold water, sexual intercourse, as well as some medical procedures. It usually affects people above 50 and the risk appears to increase in older people with a history of migraines.It is difficult to distinguish immediately whether the sudden memory loss is due to TGA or a serious condition such as stroke, TIA or seizure. Because of this, prompt medical attention should be immediately given for persons experiencing sudden memory loss and confusion.It would be advisable to have your mother consult a physician at the earliest possible time to assess her medical status.Good luck.	post_2151949
post_2449469	Jan 31, 2008	404804	346193	Joan2578	This happened to me one day and my doctor diagnosed it as TGA. HE said short memory loss like that is TGA and it will usually happen one in a lifetime and that it isn't really anything to worry about.	post_2151949
post_2299824	Jan 01, 2008	368886	254172	junie37	Hello.I appreciate the way you have described the symptoms. You have given a clear picture of what your husband is going through. I will try my best to match your query.First of all, there is nothing in the examination or investigations that rule out dementia in him. I would rather go for at least a Neuropsychological assessment and an MRI of the Brain.Since your husband is a chronic hypertensive, he may have developed small areas of infarction in the sub-cortical white matter. Again, an MRI is essential. This condition may cause a vascular kind of dementia.Regarding the doubt about this being a TIA. A TIA is typically a spell of neuronal ischemia which lasts not more than 24 hours. Since the symptoms are longer than this, we can rule out the TIA here.Since he is having problems in decision making, it looks like some of his frontal lobe functions are affected. It remains to be seen if the laser was responsible.I would recommend that you schedule an MRI with and without contrast, a Neuropsychological assessment and a Neurologist's visit.Hope you get your answers soon.RegardsDr Abhijeet Deshmukh	post_2292345

post_2276820	Dec 26, 2007	368886	370631	Daughter52	Hello.I understand your concern. But it is always better to have a clear diagnosis before we start treatment. This prevents any complications in the future.The EEG and MRI will be able to tell if he has signs of Dementia. If the memory loss is recent, he may have what is called as 'Mild Cognitive Impairment' (MCI), which is an early stage of dementia. The possible treatments do include Aricept and Razadyne among other non-drug treatments.The tests are being done to help us diagnose Dementia or MCI. If the tests do not indicate these, we have to think of other possibilities, and the treatment line will change.Regards	post_2276735

post_2927256	May 20, 2008	512985	None	None	Alzheimer's disease (AD), also called Alzheimer disease or simply Alzheimer's, is the most common cause of dementia, afflicting 24 million people worldwide. Alzheimer's is a degenerative and terminal disease for which there is currently no known cure. In its most common form, it occurs in people over 65 years old although a less-prevalent early-onset form also exists. The disease can begin many years before it is eventually diagnosed. In its early stages, short-term memory loss is the most common symptom, often initially thought to be caused by aging or stress by the sufferer. Later symptoms include confusion, anger, mood swings, language breakdown, long-term memory loss, and the general withdrawal of the sufferer as his or her senses decline. Gradually the sufferer loses minor, and then major bodily functions, until death occurs. Although the symptoms are common, each individual experiences the symptoms in unique ways. http://curealzheimersdisease.50webs.com/	post_2753258

post_2980962	May 31, 2008	306245	None	None	The Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome(Alcohol-Related Dementia)DefinitionWernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a neurological disorder. Wernicke's Encephalopathy and Korsakoff's Psychosis are the acute and chronic phases, respectively, of the same disease.WKS is caused by a deficiency in the B vitamin thiamine. Thiamine plays a role in metabolizing glucose to produce energy for the brain. An absence of thiamine therefore results in an inadequate supply of energy to the brain, particularly the hypothalmus (which regulates body temperature, growth and appetite and has a role in emotional response. It also controls pituitary functions including metabolism and hormones) and mammillary bodies (where neural pathways connect various parts of the brain involved in memory functions). The disease is typically associated with chronic alcoholism, but may be associated with malnutrition or other conditions which cause nutritional deficiencies.FactsWKS has a relatively low prevalence (0.4% to 2.8% of reported autopsies). However, it is likely that the disease is under-reported and under-diagnosed. An estimated 25% of WKS cases were missed where the brains were not examined microscopically. Another study found that only 20% of clinical WKS diagnoses were made correctly in life when compared to autopsy results. Moreover, WKS appears to be only one distinct disease that causes alcohol-related dementia. Based on clinical research studies, between 22% to 29% of individuals with dementia were found to be heavy drinkers or alcoholics and 9% to 23% of elderly alcoholics in alcoholism treatment were found to also have dementia. An estimated 1.1 to 2.3 million older Americans have problems with alcohol. Medical researchers are still grappling with how to more fully define the association between heavy alcohol use and symptoms of dementia.SymptomsWKS symptoms may be long-lasting or permanent and should be distinguished from the acute affects of alcohol consumption or from a period of alcohol "withdrawal." The disease is characterized by mental confusion, amnesia (a permanent gap in memory) and impaired short-term memory. An estimated 80% of persons with WKS continue to have a chronic memory disorder. Individuals often appear apathetic and inattentive and some may experience agitation. In addition, WKS tends to impair the person's ability to learn new information or tasks. Individuals with WKS are known to "confabulate" (make up or invent information to compensate for poor memory). Other symptoms include ataxia (weakness in limbs or lack of muscle coordination, unsteady gait), slow walking, rapid, tremor-like eye movements or paralysis of eye muscles Fine motor function (e.g., hand or finger movements) may be diminished and sense of smell also may be affected. In the advanced stages, coma can occur. Although treatable if caught early enough, the death rate from WKS is relatively high, about 10% to 20%.	post_2753258
post_2980966	May 31, 2008	306245	None	None	DiagnosisWKS is often missed as a diagnosis. In the acute phase, a physical examination may reveal skin changes and a red "beefy" tongue. In addition, blood count, electrolytes and liver function tests should be conducted. Even in the chronic phase, an MRI may show shrunken mammillary bodies and other changes in the brain. CT scans have showed enlarged ventricles and diencephalic lesions.It is important that a full medical history include information about the person's daily drinking habits, both present and past. Family, friends and past medical records should be consulted to obtain the most complete information possible on the person's history with alcohol. Proposed criteria for diagnosing alcohol-related dementia (not strictly WKS) suggest that the diagnosis be made at least 60 days after the last exposure to alcohol and that a "significant" alcohol history would include an average of 35 drinks per week for men (28 for women) for at least five years. Typically, the period of significant drinking must be within three years of the onset of dementia.Recent medical research also suggests that the genetic marker APOE4 is a significant predictor of global intellectual deficits in people with WKS. Individuals with the ApoE genotype may experience a certain interaction with heavy alcohol use which could predispose them to WKS. Concerns about an inherited susceptibility to WKS should be discussed with a genetic counselor.In cases of suspected non-alcohol related WKS, the physician may investigate anorexia nervosa, hypermesis gravidarum, severe malnutrition and other disorders or surgical procedures which impair intestinal absorption of thiamine.TreatmentIf caught early enough, WKS is a preventable, treatable disease. Treatment consists of thiamine replacement therapy, sometimes along with other vitamins. Dosages may vary and should be monitored closely by a physician. If alcoholic consumption stops and treatment is properly administered, individuals with early-stage WKS can expect a marked recovery and may be capable of learning simple, repetitive tasks.However, the person's confusion may take some time to subside and even incomplete recovery of memory can take up to a year. In the later stages, if damage to the brain is irreversible, individuals are likely to have lasting problems with memory and gait (for example, lack of muscle coordination and numbness or weakness in limbs).again good luck and I hope this helps somemichelle	post_2753258

post_3022981	Jun 10, 2008	532802	474238	shirley48	There is one simple test used in the beginning.    Tell the person that you are going to name 3 things, for example book, dog, chair. Also let them know you are going to ask again in awhile what they are.    Then engage the person in a conversation about something completely different.    After about 10 minutes, ask the person to name the objects.    At first my father would name all 3.    Months later he could name 2 and was very disturbed that he could not remember the 3rd.    Now he just guesses.    We don't correct him. And that's one simple indication that he has memory loss and how its progressing. Chances are if the person you are describing is concerned, she doesn't have it.    When people don't know they are forgetting it is more of an indication that something is wrong.    HOWEVER, I am just a caregiver, not a medical person, so take my words for whatever you think they are worth.	post_2753258

It starts in the 40's 50's and early 6o's/ They have even found a few in their 20's now.    Agression and reasoning is the main thing.    Personality change one.    mild man    and non talker turn to talking and will fight every little thing.    looking at things and not under standing or acts like he never even seen it before than he is normal for a while. When stressed out gets mad and can't figure out anything.    He cleaned house the best and than dumped grass in the street.    Had a long hose on vacum and said the vacum couldn't work with it and he took it off and put the hose in the machine. I told him, honey the long hose was to get under the rabbit cage and the way he had it could only do the main rug. He yeild at me and said don't you call me honey and said it wouldn't work with it on.    Well than it went from bad to worse.    Doctor would listen to me for five years until I force the issue and than they done test and he passed them with only one wrong. He was perfect for a week than he did more things not right.    They ruled out Alz. and ran some more test and    sent him to a Neurogist/sp and after reading what I wrote of the thing he done for five years he done some test and the clock one really showed up.    Draw a clock put the numbers in and time is 9:15 make sure the small hand for the hour and long for the minutes.    He left out the 12. put    the time as 9:05 and made the hands the same.now at 7 years He has a hard time writting and reading.    When asked to draw the clock    he put the numbers in back wards 12 11 10 etc clockwise.    but can function pretty good other wise. Most people don't see that he has anything wrong with him. But he follows me around and wants me to do what he can't and gets mad when I can't get him to understand simply direction. Like lift up on the table he may hold it down. Carry something off to different room which may not go there. he puts his keys into his shaving kit.etc.    Just a sample of Picks.    some people are different things they do.    Thyroid can cause systoms like dementia and alot of other things.    Get lot of sleep and eat good.    exercise Keep you mind active also Don't drink or do drugs because it kill the brain    and what you do a 20 and 30 will cause problems down the line. Sorry but the Neurogist said that the when kid do these things in the height of brain growth it kills it.    good luck rbcf	post_2753258

post_3482186	Oct 02, 2008	638882	427425	LOMESIE	My 88 year old mother has been itching all over her body for 3 years (it is obsessive).    She spends much of her day itching her skin.    She itches so badly that she scratches herself until she bleeds.     Also, she has growths on her legs that look like volcano-shaped mounds with something growing out of the top.    Some are as large as an eraser on a pencil.     When dermatologists (we have seen 5 different ones) do a biopsy they tell me that they are squamos cell cancers.    At first, I had the dermotologists remove the bumps.    Now I have given up because she just grows more. The itching began on her back, moved to her arms, chest, and legs.    Five months ago she fell and hit her head.    Now the itching has also moved to her scalp.    She had been on Aricept and Namenda for many years.    In Jan 2008 she stopped all medication.    The itching continued but she rapidly began going down hill mentally.    She has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.    To date she is totally confused about everything and everyone.    My mother is skin and bone, as is yours, yet she has an incredible appetite.    After each meal she goes into the kitchen to find out if there is anything left. She eats snacks between meals because she is always hungry.    It seems to me as if her body is not processing the food that she eats.    She had shingles about 4 years ago which lasted for about three months.    I am looking into Morgellons Disease.	post_2542770

post_3084878	Jun 26, 2008	327086	None	wingnut	Just a hunch here...Have you seen a vascular specialist? One who can scan and map all the blood vessels from your neck upwards? and have you been seen by a cardiologist? The reason I ask, is because the symptoms you describe can be from hypoxic events to your brain (low oxygen amounts) that can be caused by intermittent episodes of irregular or fast heart beat patterns, a build up of plaque in your neck vessels that nearly cuts off the blood flow now and then, or perhaps ministrokes called TIA's...It is most concerning because you mention it is brought on by physical activity...Has your DR listened with a stethoscope to your neck for "Bruits"? This is a sound made by blood rushing through a narrowed neck vessel...It would indicate a plaque blockage forming...good luck...this sounds like something "structural" rather than "electrical"...(I'm not a Dr, just a paramedic who's seen a lot in 25 yrs of patient care..)                                                                                                                                                                 ~Melnda	post_2670291

post_3351875	Sep 01, 2008	426039	None	justme00	I use to get headaches severe type and also lose vision , talking, paralize- basic stroke type systoms.    I could get it on my right , left or both / sometimes no headach with it.    I would stop on green and go on red. /The people I would work with sometimes would be called someone elses name and I knew I called them wrong names but what I thought came out different.    I got rid of my husband it cut the headaches out half and the job next.    Main head aches only come under major stress.    But I still lose my eyesight at times. All so have close up vision comming and going blurs alot.    / near 13 year after minor stroke .    Right hand still has problems holding things.    What I'm trying to say The doctors thought I was everything else was wrong with me but when I went into the hospital with a minor stoke systoms they finally figured it out .    Try to get to another nero. from a male clinic in Rodchester Minn or Another type like it closer.    They may find out what it is.    My Husband has Picks and it is the front lobe dying and no one could figure it out.    Does it happen when you get stressed and if it does that is when the doctor should see you.    Roger got stressed out while going to see the nero. doctor and than and with all the things I wrote about that he done in the 5 years / yes 5 years, that the Doctor done some simple test, got the answer.    He is normal for a week and than he does things that he wouldn't have done .    The clock    was    done which he was to draw in the numbers 1-12 time 9:15 and the arrows to the hours and min,     He left out the 12, 9:05 and point the arrows inwards the same size.    Other test went about the same.    When he was being tested before and was calm he passed the test perfect with one wrong /it lasted 2 1/2 hrs.    The Woman came out and said he was really intelligent and only missed one wrong and she had never seen anyone miss just one.    They need to see it in action.    I hope you get the answers/ He also didn/t remember that some things happen. and can funtion normal most days and than he does things again.    He is in 7 years into it and now is almost every day to every third day having troubles with Tv control , putting things in the wrong places, not being able to write but can still read.rbcf	post_2670291

Sneezing can further be triggered through sudden exposure to bright light, a particularly full stomach, or as a result of unexpected, climatic variations in one's environment such as rapid changes in temperature and humidity levels.Therefore, in presence of appropriate stimuli, sneezing may take place.Best regards	post_2373497
post_2555408	Feb 24, 2008	426039	None	betty	two years ago my husband was finally diagnosed with Picks disease but had it for 5 yrs. and his personaity change and he would do things he normally wouldn't .    Picks is the front lobes dying and has pick antibodies.    He repeats certain things over and over until something else comes up [momma me a} The Picks doesn't stop him from knowing me , matter of fact he know alot more but does get hooked on certain things and they don't notice they are doing it.    They say he will get down to not talking later and will be mute.    Now he gets mad over everything. He follows me around and wants me to do what he can't.    He wants me to get him everything but than he gets mad if I do.    reasoning is hard.    Even if you tell him why he can't understand it , so I say it another way and he gets madder still.    So most times he is mad and I learn to hide until he gets over it.    I'm frustated because He can't understand and I can't give him what he needs .    this disease begins in their 40, 50, and early 60's.    He is now 65 years old.    How did your husband react before he went into the nursing home.    One ladies husband    was kind of mean and he turned very nice.    He let her take care of everything with out a fight.    My husband would follow me around and ask me where does that go, what should I do with this.    I couldn't even go to the bathroom with out him asking me what was I doing in there.    He askes are you sleeping when I was sleeping.    He had panic attacks worrying about going to work.    He would wake up every 15min-every hr. dress to go to work    when he should have been sleeping.    He also started the stutter like he couldn't get the right words out . He is on Aircept and Namenda and now can do most stuff.    I hop you find out more.    The Neurologist is the one who help him and me. I wrote every thing down That I could remember he did that wasn't normal from stopping in intersections, spacy , do thing different than normal.    dumping garbage out into the street instead of the garbage.    My husband was very good at cleaning and he couldn't understand how the vacum cleaner could work with the long hose on it.    You need a name for the degenerative brain disease.    It helps alot to finally know what it is and How they can treat it. good luck. I went to regular doctor and other people and they said he was a very smart man and past all their test.    But he was normal most days and than he did thing he didn't do before so they didn't get to see it.    When we were going to the Neurologist he was upset and than you could see what he was just normal and the doctor got to see it.    Now he function almost normal except for small things and than he goes off the wall.rbcf	post_2391344

post_2649320	Mar 15, 2008	450618	None	None	Hey.Sorry to hear about your mom.I'm not a professional, but I'm in a similar position, so here's my token:Can you be more specific? Your mom forgets and loses things. Like what? Are you talking stuff like "where did I put my keys" or something more serious?I'm sure you know chronic alcoholism irrevocably damages brain, so, after 50 years of consumption, one's functioning is, naturally, impaired even during sober times. The question is where to draw the line.If your mom forgets where things are, or small unimportant details, or isn't as fast as before at learning new tasks - I would still get her evaluated, if possible, just to be sure.But if your mom forgets how to do things she knew how to do, or if she forgets things that everybody knows, if her functioning becomes impaired - something is surely wrong and you need to get her evaluated, whether it's Alzheimer's or not.Here are some random examples to consider, just to see if this feels like her domain:- Can she read? Does she forget names of familiar objects? Like, a table, a chair, a cup of coffee?- Can she write, dial phone numbers, get dressed and undressed, cook, etc?- Does she get super angry and frustrated about her forgetfulness? I know alcoholics aren't the sweetest people, but is she recently angrier than usual?My father is also an alcoholic, and I also suspect Alzheimer's. He's forgetting things like how to take his shirt off, or what are days of the week. I'm not saying if your mom is better, she's fine. Very well could be not. But if she's like my father, she surely has something aside from alcoholism going on. The only reason I haven't done anything with my own father yet is because he's having psychiatric illnesses on top of alcoholism, and his psychiatrist believes this could explain the issues (father has NPD, and rationalizes every one of his actions; naturally, these rationalizations are bizzare enough to wonder).Anyway, sorry for the long post. My best input is: listen to your gut feelings, and get her evaluated if you start suspecting more than alcoholism. The main issue is whether she needs help. Alzheimer's or not - up to professionals to determine.Hope this helps.Best of luck with your mom and dad.	post_2625193

post_2980996	May 31, 2008	306245	None	None	The Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome(Alcohol-Related Dementia)DefinitionWernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) is a neurological disorder. Wernicke's Encephalopathy and Korsakoff's Psychosis are the acute and chronic phases, respectively, of the same disease.WKS is caused by a deficiency in the B vitamin thiamine. Thiamine plays a role in metabolizing glucose to produce energy for the brain. An absence of thiamine therefore results in an inadequate supply of energy to the brain, particularly the hypothalmus (which regulates body temperature, growth and appetite and has a role in emotional response. It also controls pituitary functions including metabolism and hormones) and mammillary bodies (where neural pathways connect various parts of the brain involved in memory functions). The disease is typically associated with chronic alcoholism, but may be associated with malnutrition or other conditions which cause nutritional deficiencies.FactsWKS has a relatively low prevalence (0.4% to 2.8% of reported autopsies). However, it is likely that the disease is under-reported and under-diagnosed. An estimated 25% of WKS cases were missed where the brains were not examined microscopically. Another study found that only 20% of clinical WKS diagnoses were made correctly in life when compared to autopsy results. Moreover, WKS appears to be only one distinct disease that causes alcohol-related dementia. Based on clinical research studies, between 22% to 29% of individuals with dementia were found to be heavy drinkers or alcoholics and 9% to 23% of elderly alcoholics in alcoholism treatment were found to also have dementia. An estimated 1.1 to 2.3 million older Americans have problems with alcohol. Medical researchers are still grappling with how to more fully define the association between heavy alcohol use and symptoms of dementia.SymptomsWKS symptoms may be long-lasting or permanent and should be distinguished from the acute affects of alcohol consumption or from a period of alcohol "withdrawal." The disease is characterized by mental confusion, amnesia (a permanent gap in memory) and impaired short-term memory. An estimated 80% of persons with WKS continue to have a chronic memory disorder. Individuals often appear apathetic and inattentive and some may experience agitation. In addition, WKS tends to impair the person's ability to learn new information or tasks. Individuals with WKS are known to "confabulate" (make up or invent information to compensate for poor memory). Other symptoms include ataxia (weakness in limbs or lack of muscle coordination, unsteady gait), slow walking, rapid, tremor-like eye movements or paralysis of eye muscles Fine motor function (e.g., hand or finger movements) may be diminished and sense of smell also may be affected. In the advanced stages, coma can occur. Although treatable if caught early enough, the death rate from WKS is relatively high, about 10% to 20%.	post_2625193
post_2981000	May 31, 2008	306245	None	None	DiagnosisWKS is often missed as a diagnosis. In the acute phase, a physical examination may reveal skin changes and a red "beefy" tongue. In addition, blood count, electrolytes and liver function tests should be conducted. Even in the chronic phase, an MRI may show shrunken mammillary bodies and other changes in the brain. CT scans have showed enlarged ventricles and diencephalic lesions.It is important that a full medical history include information about the person's daily drinking habits, both present and past. Family, friends and past medical records should be consulted to obtain the most complete information possible on the person's history with alcohol. Proposed criteria for diagnosing alcohol-related dementia (not strictly WKS) suggest that the diagnosis be made at least 60 days after the last exposure to alcohol and that a "significant" alcohol history would include an average of 35 drinks per week for men (28 for women) for at least five years. Typically, the period of significant drinking must be within three years of the onset of dementia.Recent medical research also suggests that the genetic marker APOE4 is a significant predictor of global intellectual deficits in people with WKS. Individuals with the ApoE genotype may experience a certain interaction with heavy alcohol use which could predispose them to WKS. Concerns about an inherited susceptibility to WKS should be discussed with a genetic counselor.In cases of suspected non-alcohol related WKS, the physician may investigate anorexia nervosa, hypermesis gravidarum, severe malnutrition and other disorders or surgical procedures which impair intestinal absorption of thiamine.TreatmentIf caught early enough, WKS is a preventable, treatable disease. Treatment consists of thiamine replacement therapy, sometimes along with other vitamins. Dosages may vary and should be monitored closely by a physician. If alcoholic consumption stops and treatment is properly administered, individuals with early-stage WKS can expect a marked recovery and may be capable of learning simple, repetitive tasks.However, the person's confusion may take some time to subside and even incomplete recovery of memory can take up to a year. In the later stages, if damage to the brain is irreversible, individuals are likely to have lasting problems with memory and gait (for example, lack of muscle coordination and numbness or weakness in limbs).again good luck and I hope this helps somemichelle	post_2625193

They seem to think she will get better.It is maddening to anyone looking at this to not DO SOMETING! The dehydration, no interest in eating, stumbling around, etc is all part of the disease.And now the dad is starting to make those statements like "somebody took my" Or "someone left some things out there that aren't mine"...the same things the mom started saying when her symptoms first started...so I'm bracing for the dad to have alzheimers too.As far as yourself, just keep your own life in perspective and keep your own stress level in check.I think all your reactions are normal.Just take one day at a time, and deal with whatever comes up one day at a time.........take care......Jo 686	post_2675470
post_2721042	Apr 01, 2008	426039	None	jessica elizebeth	My husband has Pick's disease and its starts in their 40's to 60's he has been with it 7 years and for 5 of the years no one seen the changes and thought he was fine and the doctors didn't listen either .    he was normal one day and not the next .    It changes their personailty and reasoning is out of the question. Agression is high.    That family is walking on pin and needles and They never know what is going to happen.    If you can understand how The person can't understand what is going on around him , he starts to blame others or the persom directly taken care of him for all the problems.    To put him in a home may cost anywhere from 5000 dollars to 8ooo a month depending how bad he is.    Some times taking them to different places will up set them even more.    The family has to try to take care of him and manage every thing just so so and if they make one wrong move forget to keep reciepts , forget doctor apointments,    care of pills, meals, and still maintain their lives.    Most of the time if they work they are tired from not enough sleep and Their jobs are a stress also .    They are trying to be with their father and trying to maintain what his wishes are. Most Nursing home insurance , if the person could afford it, doesn't cover all the bills and medicare doesn't cover anything either. Mostly you are damned if you have anything over 2000 dollars or nursing home insurance and enough to pay what it doesn't.    My neighbor has been paying nursing home insurance for over twenty years .    she has paid $48,000 and will still have to come up with 1800 a month on the rest of the bill.    Where will she get it when she only makes $ 500.    The family has to work and a lot of employers don't like it if these employees can't come in because of doctor appt. he is sick, he had a bad night so they were up all night .    Stress for the caregivers will bring down their health and it is known fact that they themselves may die or get really sick.    My husband doesn't want to go into a nurseing home either.    We can't aford one either.    We have a living will and it says no food given by machines. It is the worse slow dealth a person can have. I've worked in a nursing home and know how first hand the aids are.    Most only do what is needed and nothing more / the nursing home wants things done as fast as they can do it.    I've seen patients setting on the toliet for an hour.    One freind of mine was strip down to his drawers and left with a fan on him and he was so cold his bed was shaking.    He got got sick that day and died.    I seen one person have a call lite and no one came if an hour and he had soiled himself and he never had done that in his life.    I have seen people steal from and hit patients. Laught at them .    I watched one nurses aid who shoveled food into a Man's mouth time after time as fast as they could put it in and he almost choked every time.    My freind Ruth 98 just passed away she had her call lite on for over an hour.    and I went looking for some help and it still took them another 20 min. and she was almost in tears.    Nursing home isn't a good place either. Family is still the best.    May be if you could find them some help from outside call the Alzheimer asso. and get information for them    or take care of him and get them to go to a meeting with other caregivers & family.    Remember that They never took nursing    so to take care of a person and especially their father, who probably told them how to get through life, is    now is a child in a big body. You being there is The only relief that they get and until they can not take care of their father they will trie.    Try Vicks vapor rub on his feet.    Dr. Gott says it works for fungus on the toe nails and alot of other fungus. plus he gets a foot massage.    Try to do things that you see that they don't have time.    Find a book on caregiveing or go to the internet and find the main steps of helping an patient with Alz.    and leave it in the room and maybe someone may pick it up and read it.    Take the pets out and play with them for 15 mins if everything is done.    They are feeling the stress also and they are like little children and to just reasure them with a calm time will also help.    Every little bit will be a godsend to them.Thank you for caringrbcf	post_2675470

THis person had to come to the hospital and be interviewed, and then be moved into my moms hose before she could be released from the hospital. Eventually the Drs said she HAD to go into an assisted living facility. If the family doesn't go along with what the Dr. decide the kids can be arrested for parental abuse, or the Dr. will get custody of the parent and put them where he/she wants, so you might as well do what your told and put them somewhere thats convenient for the family to go visit.	post_2675470
post_3005300	Jun 06, 2008	327086	None	jessica elizabeth	Hello!I'm new to this forum, as I've just had the care of my 83 yr old Grandmother placed in my lap...Over the last 4 years she went from living very independently, to losing her license, to being forcibly (or nearly so) moved from her house to a limited assisted care facility, to full assisted care, and now to a group home (next stop is a lock down Alzheimer's home)...She has gone from a barely noticeable state of forgetfulness (and hiding it VERY well) to hiding things from herself and insisting others are stealing her stuff, to reverting back to a 4 yr old child where she tries to escape the facility, steals everyone's things and state's they are hers and has full blown temper tantrums complete with yelling, verbal abuse, and fist pounding...With ever-decreasing moments of lucidity..(At the assisted care place she followed the night nurse around for 2 hours berating her, swearing at her and calling her a bald-faced liar because Grandma didn't believe she lived there...That was one of many incidents that involved my driving 30 miles to intervene at 10 PM)I'm going through chemotherapy for my liver right now, and my mother just left for a 3 week trip out of the country after moving my Grandma 2 days before to this group home (She had planned this trip for 2 years and refused to delay it)... I'm afraid I was the one pushing to get her moved to a facility that could give her better one on one care because I knew I wouldn't be able to take care of all her nearly everyday crises alone...(My mother and I both were being called to the AC place approx 5-7 X/ week in the last 3 months because of "Grandma needs" and various crisis episodes) ..I have an out-of-state aunt who is unable to help, and a near-by uncle who is near retirement but has no desire to be involved in Grandma's physical care (he reluctantly will take her to Dr appts but makes a fuss everytime)...So, as it stands, the home and I are it right now until my mother gets back...I'm so frustrated with my family and them placing this on me...I have my own family, an ill husband and a 9 yr old daughter to take care of....Worse yet, Grandma isn't adjusting well and may not be able to stay at the home...The move brought out aspects of the Alzheimer's that were unexpected..She paces until 2 am, is very busy going around unplugging all bed alarms, TV's radios, phones, etc...Steals and hides TV remotes, and verbally attacks the other residents because she doesn't like what they are doing...She does this all waking hours...The home needs her medications changed which involves a DR office visit (they won't do it without), and I can't do it because my immunities are cr*pola right now from the chemo...Sigh...Sorry Jessica, my intent was to let you know you're not alone with the frustration of caring and the needs of the patient...and the feeling the others just don't "get it"...Unfortunately, this does get worse and no pill cures it..Maybe supplying the family with a check-off sheet of the list of Alzheimer's stages and the patient's current behaviors would help...When a patient reaches a certain point of care need, more than 1 person has to share the load...	post_2675470

post_2962088	May 27, 2008	518603	479582	Yalie22	There has been a recent escalation in the off-label use of certain pharmaceutical agents administered more appropriately for the treatment of disease. Being an ivy leaguer, here's an interesting caveat that you may want to investigate a bit further before using a selective MAO-B inhibitor. I'm uncertain how you quantify or define a "LOT" in your research efforts, but as a physician I'll endeavor to point out that your study of the potential side-effects of an agent like this is somewhat lacking.MAO-B inhibition at the levels produced by Selegiline are commensurate with about a 50% to 70% increase in synaptic dopamine. An interesting note not shared in the insert for dopamine agonists is that the brain responds to this increase by decreasing the amount of natural dopamine produced in the substantia nigra. In fact, the brain performs this down-regulation with a lot of neurotransmitters. It should interest you to know that while the half-like of selective MAOIs is somewhat better than non-selective agents, the brain can sometimes undergo permanent down-regulation depending upon the patient.This is why parkinson's patients ultimately require constantly increasing doses of levadopa because the brain continues to make less of the neurotransmitter. Consequently, a paradoxical relationship arises in the manner that artificial means can produce short-acting effects to help patients with mobility, but at the price of permanent down-regulation of whatever natural dopamine presently exists.Patients using MAOIs can also unwittingly consume food products containing levadopa and the inhibition of MAO at the intestinal level has been directly linked to hyperpyrexia.Although the selective MAOIs are more reversible in nature concerning their binding affinity, there is no conclusive evidence regarding their safety under certain conditions.So if Selegiline is something you feel is warranted to help you during "intense" times at college, you may wind up spending the more sublime periods of academia dealing with the sometimes irreversible effects of using MAOIs. They are, in many ways, toxic.Lastly, I'd suggest you place your research of this drug on the shelf until you've at least completed the baccalaureate phase of your education. A college education possesses the mysterious quality of significantly altering your values and standards as you proceed. It would be my hope that you come to learn the value in using your natural talents rather than seeking methods to inappropriately enhance them, a prospect that can sometimes be very unforgiving in the instance of drug use.Best regards,OWS, MD	post_2776473

post_2779367	Apr 14, 2008	479992	None	Alzheimer's and Soy	I have just been told that I have Early-Onset Alzheimers, moderately progressed. I am 56. I have never eaten more than a teaspoon of soy sauce once a year or so on fried rice.    No one that I know of in my family has been diagnosed with Alzheimers, Early-Onset or otherwise. I do not believe that there is an Alzheimers/Soy connection and have never heard such.    I hope this helps as well.	post_2357972
post_2786202	Apr 15, 2008	481798	None	Alzheimers Disease Community	I used to be a very big believer of soy and ate it ALL the time, in many forms.    I started to notice that my memory was getting very poor.    I was only in my 40's at the time I started eating soy seriously.    I didn't realize how bad it was till I stopped eating it.    I'm now 55 and I've been away from soy for about 3 years now.    The reason I stopped was because I heard someone in a Dr's waiting room talking about how bad it is and why.    The things she was saying made sense to me, even though I was a firm believer that it is good for us.    I always try to keep an open mind and listened to what she had to say.    I then went to Dr Mercola's website and did my own research.    I now stay away from soy and my memory has improved immensely.    Not sure if it's all in my mind (no pun intended hehe) but I'm glad I listened and did my own research.    I don't believe that soy is the only factor in memory loss, but I think more research needs to be done but the soy companies are too big and it's all about money.    We get more soy in foods that we aren't even aware of and we need to all be reading the labels and keep an open mind and do our own research, and just know that of course whatever the soy companies say about their own products is naturally going to be good, after all it's money in their pockets.    I googled "The truth about soy" and found many things but my favorite is Dr Mercola's site because he doesn't benefit from it one way or the other.    Here is a link, and if the link doesn't work just go to mercola.com and search the truth about soy.http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/12/04/soy-truth.aspxHappy searchingI hope this can help someone as it's helped me.	post_2357972

The signs in the beginning often go missed because people brush them off. I was the only one who noticed my mother-in-law was slipping. Everyone else kept saying she was fine. There are blood tests that will show for sure that your mother-in-law has dementia. Her B12 and homocystine    levels will be off. If you are doubting the diagnosis you can ask to see the tests, or speak to the doctor directly. I would do this especially if the sister in law is trying to have her deemed legally incompetent or something. This would be worth the trip out to see her. Stress can cause all sorts of things, even memory loss.    A second opinion couldn't hurt. Good luck, and I am sorry you have to deal with this.	post_2415369

I can not honestly say that the ones getting it were sleeping all of the time. Can I ask what stage is you mom in for alzheimers? it seems that when you go from about stage 2-3 you can get sleepy all of the time.but I honestly     can not remember. I would also look at her medications you could be correct that it is too much of a dose.Good luckMichelle	post_2555771
post_2445749	Jan 30, 2008	327789	223240	Vickangl4	I just lost my mom to Alz last month.    She was almost 92.    Same scenerio - in May she was also walking, talking and eating and was in an assisted living dementia unit.    About a month later she started with behavior problems (although not all Alz patients develop such problems), she also started having falls.    Don't know if the falls were related to the change in medication (to help the behavior issues) or if it was just part of the decline.    She was moved to the skilled nursing dementia unit (in the same facility) and although she still tried to walk she eventually was confined to a wheelchair.    As the months passed there was a noticable worsening in her condition. She all but stopped eating and went from 115 lbs to 89 lbs.    The nursing home suggested hospice but I couldn't agree to it - felt like I was "giving up" on her. She started eating again so I had a breath of relief but within a month she was back to not eating.    She also was very unresponsive.    She developed pneumonia and at the nursing homes urging at that time I agreed to hospice.    She passed within a weeks time.    She did not suffer.It is such a heartbreaking disease - There were times when I would go to visit her and just couldn't bring myself to go in.    When I was there she did not know who I was.     I imagine you are dealing with the same.When my Mom passed, of course I was sad, but I was also relieved that it was over -    for her.    She is now free.    I no longer have to watch her waste away and I can put that out of my mind and remember her as she would want to be remembered - as a vibrant, happy, and giving person.Good luck -	post_2445457
post_2452831	Feb 01, 2008	223240	None	Scotty2	I first want you to know how sorry I am for the loss of your Mother, My heart goes out to you, and your family. The last time I visited my Mom (few days ago) I caught myself telling myself I can't take this anymore, watching my Mom with this disease. She no longer knows me or anything, and is so frail it hurts to see her this way. And there is a part of me that knows when she does pass, she will be free, but still its hard to let go. I have no idea if she hurts, or is in any kind of pain. She has always been a very happy, healthy woman, always working in the yard planting flowers, or out in the garden. Now she just sits in a wheelchair, unaware of where she is, or who anyone around her is. I am not sure what the next step will be, like you said its hard to go in sometimes when you get to the nursing home, cause you never know what you are gonna run into next.Thank you for your kindness and God Bless you and your family	post_2445457
post_2454350	Feb 01, 2008	327789	223240	Vickangl4	Thank you.    I had many talks with the nurses there.    They told me that my mom was not in any pain and that in their own way alzheimer patients are happy - they don't know any better now.    I grew quite close to one nurse in particular - she set me at ease.    She explained that the "visits" are not really for the patient, but rather for the person visiting.    She had told me that she understood if I did not want to visit as often and that I could simply call to check up on my mom.    Of course they would call me if there was a change that I needed to be made aware of.    So the days when I got there and couldn't go in, or the days when my mom was sleeping and I would just leave, I didn't carry any guilt.    My mom would not have wanted that for me.    More than likely they may suggest hospice.    Being around alzheimer patients they know when the time is drawing near.    Look at hospice as a way to make your mom as comfortable as possible in her final days.    That is really what it is all about.    Keep the "good" pictures in your mind.    When my mom passed it was Xmas Eve in the afternoon.    My mother directed the church choir for almost 40 years, so I told myself that she "chose" that day so she could sing in the Heavenly Choir that evening.    You said your mom enjoyed the outdoors and gardening.    If you haven't already maybe a nice brightly colored plant in her room would somehow be appreciated - Be strong - take care - I will check this forum if you ever need to just talk.	post_2445457

If all the world could have such big hearts as the both of yours.Scotty2...your Mother sounds like a wonderful woman, and I am sure she was is very proud of you, I say is..because I believe God gives us all angels to watch over us, and its most likely the loved ones we have lost here on earth. Thank you Scotty2, for being the kind concerned person you are and for sharing with me about your mom. I appreciate all the concern and the prayers. Its a very hard road to follow, watching your Mother become someone you have never known before. My heart breaks just to see mine sitting in a wheelchair with no smile, no conversation. unaware of her surroundings.And Chloe802Thank you also for your warm hearted advice. I to was a CNA for 12 years years ago and I loved every minute of it. I loved the people and the job. We had many with Alz. but now I see the difference when I never knew these people before they had Alz. But my heart went out to them the same. Only this is my Mother, I remember lots of things before she ever got Alz, and those memories I hold on to dearly. I am not sure what is down the road...but I do know its not going to get any better. I am just thankful that God touched the two of you Scotty2 and Chloe802, and brought you here to this site. And one thing I almost forgot to tell you both...Mom always loved flowers, and I have sent flowers and took flowers to her many times while she has been in the nursing home..and each and every time she gives them away to the nurses or anyone that comes in her room..I thought that was funny but nice of her at the same time.I will keep in touch with both of you if thats okay.. I truley appreciate your warmth and kindness.. God Bless you both!!!!!	post_2445457
post_2495088	Feb 11, 2008	385668	None	Vickang14	Wow I realy know what youare going through.    My queen (mom) went through this disease.    The stages you mentioned are all to familiar to me. In my opinion it is the most debilitating, cruel disease there is actually.My mom lived her life as a very alert, bright, vibrant woman, able to calculate a list of numbers in her head without the use of pen or paper....until that is she was dx with early onset of dementia and alzheimer's disease in her mid to late 70's.    The disease was slowly progressive and by the time mom was in her early 80's, her life as she knew it was being stripped from her.    Mom lived in California near my brother, however, she could not live with him so I sent for her to return to her homeland Chicago.    Mom lived with me for a couple of years, and due to me being alone with no other support, and having to work, I employed nuses to come in and care for her during the day while I was at work.    Mom, when the nurses weren't there would get scared that the t.v. was to loud and she would be found walking outside by my neighbors.    GOD I almost feel like crying right now to remember this diseases cruelty and how complications from this disease, and poor care from a nursing home took the life of my mom.    I got scared and knowing better placed my queen in a nursing facility.    I know how Chicago nursing homes are (terrible to say the least), however I had no other choice, ( but feel extremely guilty for doing it) but to place her there.    I figured that since I would be there every day, I could keep an open eye on her care.....ya right!!!    What a fool I was.    Needless to say lotz of NH problems, so I transferred mom to another christian nursing facility.     It was ok for a while, however when mom started to decinegrate so did the level of care......(10-12 patient per CNA)    I was totally instumental in keeping on the staff for moms care.    I was there almost every single day, sometimes night.    At the end mom stopped eating, was wheelchair bound, no communication, and finally sleeping all of the time.    I went through that whole hospice thing, on and off.    What a terrible decision to make.    Finally mom was placed on hospice for the last time.    I watched my queen die in front of my eyes...slowly, everyday...    She was bed ridden and aquired large bed soars, OMG they were terrible.    I fought with staff to help her...to no avail.     At the end of my moms life, I left from working 3-11 to sleep in a chair by my mom side until 5 or 6 in the morning.    Left the nursing home, went to my home to get a little sleep, then returned to the nursing home before work to try and feed her with a syringe and a solution I made of vitamins and gatoraide.    I continued that regime for about a month and in NOV 2005, while observing the physiological changes in my queen, she passed away as I held her in my arms.     How appropriate, when I came into this world she held me in her arms, and when she left I held her in mine.I understand about the pain for her being over, however, my pain is just begining.    I adore my mom and struggle til today with having placed her in a nursing facility.    My mom would have NEVER placed me in harms way....What the hell is wrong with me, was I so selfish.    I suffer with the guilt.I am so sorry for telling my whole story, but maybe through it you can see that you are not alone, and this disease is dreadful.You and your mom are in my prayers...feel free to ask for support anytime...bigs hugsNervous15	post_2445457

post_3966361	Feb 08, 2009	755837	732627	monstermommy	No jokes here but I did want to leave a short reply. Admitting to hard drug use probably will turn off a lot of people but at least you are honest. If you really didn't use drugs during your pregnancy, you have no reason to blame yourself for your son's condition. I never really liked that saying about God not giving you more than you can handle. We all struggle with the difficulties in our lives, more so at some times than at others. Sounds like you are having a rought time right now. I have been caring for a disabled daughter for 38 years, so I understand how it can wear you down sometimes now matter how much you love and cherish your child.    I also wonder sometimes what it would be like to have a day to myself. It's been so long I can't remember what it's like. If you really feel like you are losing it sometimes, perhaps you should reach out to someone for help -perhaps for some kind of counseling? Sometimes it helps to just to unload your feelings to another person - someone who won't judge you. Caring for a disabled child IS hard work and no one should make you feel guilty for saying so. And taking care of yourself is necessary for youto be a good caretaker for your son. I wish you well.......	post_2717940

post_2576661	Feb 28, 2008	144586	None	None	It's hard. My first two cents worth is to let her eat when she wants, and forget about the "three meals a day". It appears to me she is being bossed around for no good reason and expresses resentment by being a pain-in-the-neck.    Getting nutrition on board when the person wants to eat is more important than a schedule. This is how I solved the problem. Get a little refrigerator for her room (about $75) and make the meals up in the morning, plus snacks, and put them in the little refrigerator. Then get a small microwave ($150) in the room for her to heat the food when she wants. The more participation she has in the situation, the better. I sense a lot of resentment here, probably justifiied, but counterproductive, and a festering sore. I think you should have looked for special houring for the elderly before moving in. This may not be available in your area. There is often a waiting list. These have private apartments set up for assisted living, daily visits by a nurse, a common area for people on the floor, daily activities, and in my area have a rental rate set at 25% of your monthly income. She doesn't qualify for hospice (usually a six month time to death is a requirment). If you are in the United States she may qualify for a part-time home attendent. It bothers me somewhat that you "moved in to take care of her" and yet she has "pain pills, heart meds, etc. you haven't bothered to find out about." Think about that statement. Unacceptable.    If you didn't want to take responsibility for her you shouldn't have moved into her home. You have been through a lot of stress and psychological pain from this situation, but you posted and that's my take. It is very labor-intensive to take on the responsibility of caring for someone else. It can occupy your entire existence. There are some people who are "psychic vampires". And they can be elderly. They drain your energy. If you are in this situation, you need additional help. Look around for a college student (preferably nursing) who will care for her a certain numnber of hours a week in return for room and board. Everyone in life has a cross to bear and we are all dealt different hands. Some good. Some hands bad. You are not a bad person and the situation is structured in such a way as to be very stressful. As far as this business about micromanaging her mother's life and getting into arguements about "one bite, two bites," I see an elderly person who is near the end who is trying to assert control by the simple method of "saying no". And all of this seems to revolve around the imposed "three-meal regimin". It appears you and your wife have reached the end of your rope. As much as I hate nursing homes, there are semi-nursing assisted living facilities available in which your patient may be much happier.    I am not sure what assets are available or what kind of assisted living facilities are around. As far as this business about "dying prematurely because he cared for her", I have heard that before and I don't buy it. I see so much anger and disguntlement and marital arguments hidden behind your post, it isn't funny. I can't tell you what your responsibilities are to this woman you are caring for. But there is no half-way. There are professionals involved in the social services business. You need to interface with one of these and see what government assisted car you can get and what care alkternatives are available. Then tally up all assets, and make a decision. If she has a go consider a reverse mortgage to pay for a full time live-in aide, and think about you and your wife moving out. You are under tremendous pressure and I don't want to seem to make your life any more difficult or make you feel bad. But this is a bad situation that will only get worse.	post_2575681
post_2577667	Feb 28, 2008	213044	None	None	As far as my ignorance of her medications, my wife takes care of that very well, and her own. It's all I can do to tell you from memory what medications I am on.My MIL is on three different pain meds, and they MUST be taken with food. Every meal has pain pills. Bedtime snack has pain pills.When her husband was alive, she was taking her pills whenever she liked and ate whenever she liked. My wife tried to straighten that out back then, to no avail.My MIL would go a week at a time too sick to get out of bed with a potty next to the bed, and her husband caring for her and letting her take her pills with no food and bringing her bread and jelly at three in the morning. Which was why she was sick and in bed.Now that her husband is gone, she really wants to be with him. Nobody wants to die, but part of her wants to die.I can relate to that, actually.There have been times she has tried to starve herself, and meals are always an issue. It's like she has a sub-concious phobia of food. But she'll get up in the middle of the night and eat a half a jar of jelly.Or bread with butter and salt on it.I found her one afternoon eating raw ground pork at the fridg. She insisted she had been doing that all her life and it was perfectly fine. I told her she couldn't do that, or she would get sick. Two hours later she was sick.She needs supervision in the eating department.It's about control, no doubt about it. It's one of the few things she has control over in her life. That, and how she chooses to spend her time.Between the need for regularity and the need to administer drugs correctly, a practice of eating breakfast, lunch, and dinner at regular, normal hours is not a terrible thing.It's when she eats two bites of green beans and one spoonful of potatos and then takes three pain pills that it becomes a problem.It has turned into a much longer term situation than I first imagined. The way her health was when her husband died, I didn't think we'd be living there for a year.In fact, we lived out of suitcases the first year while our house sat empty, but with all of our stuff in it. But my wife got her mother's meds and eating straightened out and she got healthier.At first it was fine, and everybody was family. But the last year or so my MIL has gotten very bad about eating, and she has gone through bouts where it is obvious she does not want to eat at all. My wife has drug her through those times and now it is often a contest of wills.And I'm in the middle.My wife won't let my MIL starve to death.My MIL is lucid enough to know what she is doing 80% of the time, and she is strong willed.It's no fun anymore. My wife has been under an incredible amount of stress for two years over my health. She needs a relief valve, and I'm not filling the bill.We could put her in a home. The nursing homes around here are horrible. That's why we're living here. Her Mother deserves better care and living conditions than that.She can get around fine, and enjoys looking out the picture window and kavetching about the weather. She can handle the bathroom alone 90% of the time. She just needs supervision and assistance. It's not time to put her in a home.It's time to figure out how to help my wife keep from going nuts.We don't have marital arguments. She has gotten angry with me a couple times the last few months for the way I "buffered", but we don't have arguments. We have dscussions and express our thoughts or frustrations, but we are of the same mind as far as the current and future course.We are doing the right thing. Maybe not all the right ways.But it's not easy and bouncing ideas off of other people is one way to make it easier.	post_2575681
post_2577795	Feb 28, 2008	144586	None	None	I shouldn't have been so hard on you. You have a situation which may have no answers. If possible you need to get a third person in there providing some assistance. In the United States a part time helper is often available through insurance. If not consider a reverse mortgage to find an aide. Remember if she goes into a home they will confiscatre all assets in return for taking care of her. While she is sentient you should get her to sign a health care proxy, if she agrees. I wasn't suggesting a home. The assisted living facilities are quite different. My mother (not my 103 year old sweet-heart) got into one of these complexes and enjoyed herself immensely. She had her own apartment, plus there was a pull cord to get 24/7 assistance in all the rooms, and a community room in the building, plus a daily visit from a health care professional. She had a years wait to get into this facility, which was restricted to residents of her geographical area and sponsored by a religous organization with federal funds. It was non-denomenational. There are other alternatives to nursing homes.	post_2575681
post_2578731	Feb 29, 2008	213044	None	None	There are alternatives for the well-heeled.Assisted living facilities are expensive.We have two, both connected directly to the hospital. One is for the resident that is fairly self reliant, with accomodations for certain limitations. The other is for those that need more hands-on care, but less care than many in nursing homes require.They are both very expensive and out of reach for a person on a fixed income.My MIL's SS covers her house payment, taxes, and insurance, with about $50 a month left over, which is "her" money. We pay all the rest, including her medications and her own seperate phone.We moved her folks up here from Oklahoma City in 2000, and they purchased this house with a low interest loan. There is very little equity in it, and frankly I don't care if the nursing home ends up with it or not.My wife has legal and medical power of attorney for her Mother. The house has been put in a trust, which does not shield it from the nursing home.Home Health Care isn't really something we would benefit from at this time, because my wife is willing to and capable of bathing her Mother and taking care of the house. If we had someone coming in an hour or two, or four, a week, it would be to socialize with my wife and my MIL. Maybe that would be a good thing, but it's an expense we can't afford at the moment.In hindsight, moving in was a terrible idea. We did it out of love and compassion, and with good intentions, but several situations have changed, and we find ourselves in a rather precarious spot now.Our house, which sat empty for three years, is occupied by my son and his young family. They are renting for the moment, with the intent to purchase it soon.If my MIL MUST go to the care center any time soon, we will be looking for a different place to live. She could chug along another four years as she is now, or she could wake up with a dibilitating stroke this morning.Nothing in life is secure or guaranteed, but that is a little less stability than I would have chosen with foresight.Moving in with her short term made perfect sense. I honestly thought it would be very short term. As time passed it slowly morphed into something more complicated and permanent.Had I known the toll it would take on my wife physically and mentally, I would have been ruthless and her Mother would have died in a nursing home three years ago.Between my own poor health and the fact that every time we leave the house together her mother does something naughty, we have no social life any more.We don't visit friends, they don't visit us. We seldom go out to eat. "Shopping days" or weekend outings are infrequent.It's no huge mystery why my wife is short tempered or impatient. She needs an outlet. Emphasis on the OUT. I just don't know how to help her.This whole post is about me, about "we". My MIL is getting along fine. It is us young ones who need the help here. We are the ones in an increasingly difficult situation. My MIL is lying in bed blissfully sleeping. We're the ones who need help, not her.She's getting all the care and attention she needs, albeit sometimes the assistance is provided tersly of late.I'm looking for tools or coping skills to help my wife and I survive this. I don't want my wife looking back on these years after her Mother is gone and wallowing in grief because she had her buttons pushed by her Mother so many times that she grew to hate her.It's not like we are the only ones doing this. Well, nobody else in this town is doing it. People have been doing it for centuries.The only real difference in our situation is the fact that we moved in with her rather than her moving in with us. Under the circumstances, it was required. Our house was not a practical living situation for her. It has, however, complicated things quite a bit.I'm just venting, looking for suggestions, and venting.	post_2575681
post_2580203	Feb 29, 2008	224209	213044	AR-10	Your situation sounds intolerable. Here is the way I see it:Your job as a husband is to protect yourself and your wife from the insanity of this situation. Your wife sounds like she is on the verge of a total break-down, and no one should have to live this way.Your MIL sounds like a master manipulator who enjoys being the "queen" of the household and pulling everyone else strings like puppets. She is being unreasonable, uncooperative, manipulative, and selfish. This does not sound like it is part of the dementia because it sounds like she has always been like this, and she got away with it with your FIL, and now she is getting away with it with you and your wife. You cannot control her, but you can control your response to her and limit what you are willing to do for her. She should be doing as much as she is capable of for herself, not being waited on and catered to like she is on vacation in a 5 star hotel. People like this can totally suck you dry, make you sick, ruin your marriage, and they make it seem like it is you, not them, at fault.There are several caregiver organizations that you can access online who can help you find a caregiver's support group. Just do an online search for caregiver organizations and you will find them. You and your wife would probably benefit immensely from seeing a therapist on a regular basis to help you set boundaries on her demands, control issues, and manipulations, and to help you figure out how to get out of this house, either permanently or on a regular basis for some positive experiences and interactions. She is consuming you, and dealing with people like that is extremely difficult. She won't change, but you can change your response to her and say no to some of her demands.You can refuse to talk about negative issues, change the subject, or just walk away and not be around her (but tell her why, so she has the opportunity to think about it.)She may be depressed and one of the symptoms of depression is a negative outlook on life and everyone and everything about it. She should be evaluated for depression, and treated for it if that is the case.Go to the library and do a subject search on personality disorders- narcissism, borderline personality, etc. Look also at dependancy and dealing with manipulative people. See if any of that info fits and check out some books.Hire a high school helper to come in several times a week for 2-3 hrs. to get out of the house and away from her. Make a rule that during that time, you do something enjoyable, and do not discuss her or the situation. Just focus on fun, your relationship, and your freedom. If at all possible-move out and get a live-in in exchange for room and board. The money you spend on help may save your sanity and health. High school helpers are often happy to have an after school job, even at minimum wage. While they are there, they can empty the dishwasher, straighten up, fold and put away clothes, dust, water plants, etc. Six to eight dollars an hour is reasonable for your escape times.They can do those things and still talk to your MIL and keep her company.Does your wife have any siblings that can come care for your MIL so you and your wife can take an actual vacation?I would have a serious discussion with your MIL and give her the tough love approach. I would give her jobs to do, like fold clothes, etc.and make her responsible for taking care of herself in every way she is physically capable of. It sounds like you are doing way more for her than need be and enabling her dependancy on you, much like a spouse can enable an alcoholic to keep drinking. This is destructive behavior, even though you feel like you must help her, take care of her, and feel guilty if you don't. If you expect something from her, she may rise to the occasion and feel more productive and happy.I wish you luck and fortitude. Don't remain a slave to her and ask for help from other family members if your wife is doing it all and there are others who could pitch in.	post_2575681
post_2580937	Feb 29, 2008	310108	None	AR	yes your first mistake was in moving in with her if she was able to do for herself your wife could have went over once a day or 4 times a wk anyone can get some one in for 4 hours a day i think it is 3 days per week or they will come in every day for 2 hours and it would be free anyone thet draws medicare can get it free your wife and you should have took her out somewhere where the seniors go i can see why she would be getting dementia just sitting in the house she should have been told to do for herself as long as she was able to be waited on all of the time is not good but that is you and your wifes fault she should have had some kind of therapy and that is free to make use of all her limbs also the caregiver could have fixed her food for several days and as caregiver said she could have a small fridge but it is better if she walks to get it i have worked for 40 years with people all ages and i loved taking care of them but you have to be firm but kindalso she needs to keep her mind occupied and let her watch her own tv in her room and you and wife in another that is if you stay you may have worked hard all your life as you put it 15 years that is not long i also worked hard all my life started at 15 and i quit at 72 to take care    of cancer husband who is on oxygen and that has been quite some time there was a time when i could not walk but i knew i had to so i almost crawled but i walk now also it is a little late to start trying to train those muscles of mil but try and tell you wife to let day care come in and help some and tell mil to do what she can    hind sight i guess does not help but you will know now to have someone do more for ones self and i bet she would have been glad to if you had told her to it really is hard to advise this late in the game yoo said you did not think it would be this long what did you expect for her to die soon no disrespect intended but if you wife wants it free care is provided thru medicare if she is still able to walk maybe just maybe your wife can train her a little to do more for herself she should have done that right off and said mom you have to help yourself some she might have do it yet if wife tells her she is getting to tired to do it also most people with health problems think of death that is common why not give it a try trll your wife to tell mom she is sick let wife pretend she cant get this or that and just wait and see just what the ole gal is capable of if she can be manipulative she can do more give it a whirl what can you lose i know your frustrations i have been there my mom was bedfast also my husband does not walk i am still there but i will do the best i can caregiver comes in twice a week gives him sponge bath i do    hope that you and your wife can work out some solution are there other children maybe i do wish that i could be of more help but let her entertain herself give her something to do and if she yells let her yell she will quit soon                     lots of luck     jo	post_2575681
post_2580945	Feb 29, 2008	418676	None	None	I have such sympathy for you. You are going through what we could be working up to in the next couple of years. We had to move my mom in with us because she wasn't taking care of herself and was getting sicker and thinner month after month. After a couple of trips to the hospital, and a couple of weeks in a skilled nursing facility, she agreed to move in with us. She made herself sick by constantly eating semi-spoiled food from dirty plates. Her refrigerator was a biological red zone. She wouldn't exercise (she has emphysema and lacks "energy"). She wouldn't take proper care of her dog. Since she has moved in with us, she has gained almost 20 pounds (she had developed a two year case of IBS for no "apparent" reason. That's because she never told a doctor about her constant daily bacteria intake) and isn't weak and wobbly the way she was. Still no energy, and she never will have, because she still sneaks cigarettes with advanced emphysema and only walks her dog slowly for short distances. She spent 6 weeks in a pulmonary rehab program building up her strength and endurance, and the day it ended was the day she stopped doing a single thing they had taught her.So I have a mom who has all her mental faculties, but has no energy and rarely goes out and just sits and does crossword puzzles in the living room day in and day out.My husband deals with it very well, but I'm going completely bonkers. All I do is wash dishes and clothes and cook meals and feed her dog because she's too busy with her crossword puzzle to remember. I keep wondering what's going to happen when she makes the next notch down in energy or mobility. She already has a scooter chair but won't use it.It has only been a little over a year, but I'm seeing years of claustrophobia and frustration from living with my mother. I have already begged my sisters in Alaska to please please PLEASE convince her to go up there for a couple of months some time this year.For those of you who have to deal with dementia or pill giving or mobility, I am SO sorry. I'm doing this because I love my mom and don't want her final years to be lived in squalor and sickness, but jeez, instead I get to spend my days thinking of her as a really annoying roommate and hiding out in the garage when I get too claustrophobic (and yes, we have a very small house and I am unemployed).	post_2575681
post_2581859	Feb 29, 2008	213044	None	None	I think it's actually easier to deal with if it's not your own parent. There are things that drive my wife up the wall that really don't upset me that much.Mother and Daughter is very different than me and MIL. Mother and daughter have had MANY years to learn what sets the other off, and button pushing is easy and entertaining if you are bored.My MIL will set at the table and make a remark that basically translates to "you're getting fat", just to tick my wife off, and then look at me and say "what did I do?" when my wife gets upset.I keep my buttons well hidden.Why did I think it would be a short term araingement?My MIL was in a hospital recovering from a broken hip when her husband died. Her health was very bad, and had been for some time, because of her pill taking/eating habits.She had an operation on her brain the year before, because she skipped several doctor appointments, because she didn't want to leave the house, and ended up overdosing on Cumadin(coumadin)(sp?) and bleeding from every weak spot in her body.With the broken hip, she graduated from extended care in the hospital to rehab in the care center, and when the care center said they had made as much progress with her as they could, we decided to take her home and move in with her.She was able to get around with a walker, but cooking and living on her own was not possible. Her health was still rocky, and she was in her late 70's and had lost her mate of 53 years.She was grieving that loss and to be perfectly frank, I expected her to die soon. She was mad that Bill had left her alone, and just wanted to go be with him.Given the fact that the last year she had been in bed and unable to get to the bathroom much of the time, I did not expect a miraculous turn-around, but I could not see the point of leaving her to rot in the foul facility that we have here.We took her home to let her die the way I would want to die. At home, in bed. Not in some stinking facility where they wheel you to the dinner table and then wheel you back to your room whether you have eaten or not. Or let you skip supper if you tell them you are not in the mood.So yah, I expected a short stay. Two months turned into six, turned into a year, and we decided we had lived out of suitcases long enough.My wife nursed her back to health by forcing her to take her meds properly, and forcing her to go to doctor's appointments, and forcing her to eat balanced meals. Sort of like they would do at any competant hospital or nursing facility.It has been a battle of wills the whole time.My MIL is lazy. If my wife gives her her clean laundry and asks her to fold it and put it away, it ends up in a pile on a chair in her room. She is lazy. She could clean the kitchen or dust her bedroom herself if she wanted to, but she wants to lay in bed.She could sit at the table and read or do puzzles or watch TV or any number of things, but she doesn't want to spend more than fifteen minutes out of bed. LAZY!!!She doesn't want to eat, because that makes her go to the bathroom, and both activities require her to get out of bed.Yah, her husband died prematurely because she wore him out. He waited on her hand and foot, did all the cooking and shopping, cleaned up her messes, and had heart failure before his time.She's nearly worn us out, and if it was just my wife doing it, she would be in worse shape than she is now.That sounds bitter and angry, I am sure, but it is an honest assessment of the situation.I'll look online and see if there is a forum I can get my wife interested in. We both need counselling, or an outlet of some sort. Venting here has helped me. But I'm used to internet forums.My wife would get upset about some of the comments in this thread, but I understand that it is hard to communicate via computer, and the WHOLE story rarely gets told in one or two posts, so people offer their thoughts and suggestions based on incomplete information. I do it all the time.That, and sometimes the truth hurts. We're not perfect. I'm looking for opinions and suggestions, and my feelings aren't going to get hurt if I'm told I am wrong.I apreciate the advice, suggestions, and commiseration. I'll keep an eye on this thread and think about what each of you have shared.It doesn't bother me if someone here thinks I'm an insensative idiot, or if they recommend something that is not possible in our particular circumstance. I just pump out another post, try to explain things, upset somebody else, and strike a chord with someone who reads it and says "you know, MY Mother is becoming an annoying roommate...".My wife hides in the basement a lot, on her computer. I hide in the garage. :^)	post_2575681

post_2584205	Mar 01, 2008	224209	213044	AR-10	Your MIL may be seriously depressed, which makes people want to escape life by staying in bed, in the house, not doing anything (including eating) because they have no energy or motivation. Has she been evaluated for depression? Has she had her thyroid levels checked to see if her thyroid is working adequately? Treatment is possible and can work wonders. Your best bet is a geriatric psychiatrist if one is available in your area, but any good psychiatrist or even her regular doctor can prescribe meds for depression.I feel for you and hope you find some answers and help for all of you.	post_2575681
post_2587828	Mar 02, 2008	437443	213044	AR-10	My best bet is that your MIL could have some kind of depresiion, as seyf suggested.You moving in with her is in a way putting the ball in your court as the opposite, her coming to live with you. Her husband passing away is a big blow for your MIL, and an understandable one. My mother went to live with my younger brother and then with me after my dad passed away and my mom was depressed for almost 2 years (she cried as my dad was mentioned since they were married for 49 yrs.), but after she was catered by my brother and my SIL I told her to live with me. She dis everything in my apartment, from fixing me breakfast every day and cleaning the whole apartment for 5 years, untill she was had heart failure in March 2006 (atrial fillibration) and had to go be taken by ambulance to the hospital. She lost 30 lbs. during that hospital stay and was never again able to do most she did before, but she still fixes me breakfast every day, and fixes the beds. But we had enormous support from church friends who caome here almost every day to help. Now she had to be taken to the hospital again last December for her fast heart beat and for a pacemaker implant. It took her 2 months to recover. Now I will have to move to a ground level apartment because she has geart difficulty going up and down the stair case. A mayor change in my live was that since March 2006 I had to becaome the chef of the house and I fix all dinners and lunches since then, the good side is that enjoy cooking and it became my hobby...Your wife is doing the job of the best nurse in the world. But she needs to be given a break, because with so much stress her emotional situation is a ticking bomb...In my case there is no case of depression and that is the mayor advantage or blessing inmy case. I am telling you all this so you could compare and see that others care for you and you are not alone. Your situation is very difficult to solve overnight. It has taken already too much patience and endurance. You and your wife are doing a lot of good to you MIL, but both of you need a break NOW. Could yo talk to people in your church or denomination so they can come and visit while you both go out and have a dinner outside the house, just the two of you alone? Or just go to the movies...or anything you both used to enjoy doing before all this happened. I guarantee you that a regular break will do lots of good and you might come up with a solution.	post_2575681

post_2590380	Mar 03, 2008	213044	None	None	It doesn't feel like we're doing so great.My MIL may be depressed. That's certainly possible.My wife has been on anti-depressants for three years, and I've been having health problems for three years.I should be on anti-depressants, but my doctors tell me it would not be a good idea because of my illness.I think with my MIL it is just a personality clash that I didn't see fully until we actually lived with her. She just is who she is.My own Mother, who is dead now, had a very negative, destructive personality and we kids had a talk long before she went to the care center and decided she wasn't going to live with any of us.She would have destroyed my marriage and my mental health within a year. Some people are impossible to get along with.caregiver222, I don't have any problems with your input. Like I said, even with all I posted it's only half the story.We're in a hard spot because I didn't think far enough ahead and let an emotional situation cloud my judgement. We did the right thing, but I have painted us into a corner.If it was JUST the stress of dealing with her Mother, my wife would not be struggling quite as badly as she is. My health is bad now, and I'm not working. There have been some very scary moments the last few years and times when I could not take care of myself, leaving my wife to care for both of us for weeks here and there.The fear of losing me and the extra work of caring for two people at once has been very hard on her. I worry about her a lot because of the stress she is under. I try to help as much as I can, but there is only so much I can do for her emotionally. I help with the housework, but I am under foot, which is another change in all our routines.The money situation is a constant struggle with me not working, and that is one more stress factor we both deal with.It's just a lot of stress, and I need to help my wife find an outlet. A support group where she can sit and talk with others and know that it's not her fault that she is under such stress and that other people get angry with those they love from time to time.I apreciate the thoughts and suggestions you all have given me. Maybe I can get her to sign up and post here.I ran the idea past her, and she is not real excited about it, but I know it would help her. I'll look harder within the community, too. I know there must be someone in a similar situation she could "go to coffee" with from time to time.It's not much, but anything that would help the least little bit would still be help.thanks.	post_2575681
post_2591223	Mar 03, 2008	224209	213044	AR-10	Do you have a senior day care center or senior rec center in your community? If your MIL can walk with a walker, it would be great to get her out of the house, with other people, for socialization and stimulation, and that would give you both a break. Most communities have something along those lines where you can drop in or schedule regular periods for your senior to be there (with supervision). It would do you all some good to get some space from one another, and if she can go to the doctor and hairdresser, she could go to a senior center. Don't ask her-she'll probably say no, just tell her, or give her a choice, like, do you want to go today or tomorrow? Not going is not an option, but to let her have some control over when she goes would be good. Get a Senior Blue Book for your community at a nursing home, senior center, or possibly your county Dept. of Health. It is worth its weight in gold, full of resources for senior help, activities, volunteer visitation, classes on caregiving, etc. Hope some of this helps. You are placing blame on yourself for your decision to move in with her, but you had no idea what it was going to be like, and you should commend yourself for being willing to help her. You made the best choice you could at the time with the information you had, and none of us know what something is going to be like till we are in the thick of it. Caregiving is difficult even in the best circumstances, so try to let the guilt go and focus on problem solving to make the best choices going forward. A support group will be a wealth of information and emotional support for you and your wife.	post_2575681
post_2597576	Mar 04, 2008	306867	None	None	I just had it out with my mother.    My sister told me to come on here and read some.    I can't believe how much I can relate.    My mother and I always had a great relationship.....Until she moved in 2 years ago.     The annoying room-mate is exactly what it has become.     She is 80 and capable of doing more than she does. She also lies in bed all day.    I know if I was to have any healthcare proffesional come in they would want her up and moving.    I have tried to encourage her to just take the tiny walk down the driveway to get the mail and the fight begins.    Her hygeine is awful. She does not wash her hands and has a messy colostomy to deal with.    The first year she was here I took care of her colosotmy for her and know how messy it is.The worst part about this is I am 47 years old and single.    I am becoming a recluse and so unhappy.    This is going to sound so selfish but I can't help but think ....what about me and my life.    I don't have it as bad as many. She does feed and occasionally shower herself.     I own my own home with a pool and used to love to entertain with BBQ's and such.    Now I'm getting like my mother . I don't care to much about keeping my house clean    no one ever comes over any more since she moved in.    I gave her the large master bedroom and bath, she took over my kitchen island , where i used to run my business.    I now eat all my meals in my bedroom.    I can't stand to watch her eat any longer.    I know you all are going to read this and think I am a horrible daughter, but I am being honest.    Its like some stranger moved in and I lost my mother 2 years ago.    I loved my mother so much, but am having a hard time loving this stranger that lives with me now.    She is so negative and it's sucking the life outta me. She was put on antidepressants a while back , and they did help for a while.    I'm sure they need to up her dose but she refuses to take more.    Nothing nice is really said between us anymore.    Any conversations she turns them into something about her.    Sometimes I feel so resentful because I want my house and life back.    I never thought these words could ever come out of my mouth about my mother.    I worshiped her.        Thanks for letting me vent.	post_2575681
post_2598372	Mar 04, 2008	389974	None	None	Swampy believes that the number one thing you must not do is sacrifice your own health for the health of another.Swampy knows it sounds selfish, but your relationships, your dreams, your life is yours. Not your mother in law's, not your sister's, not your dad's...yours.This means that taking care of yourself must always be first priority. You can sacrifice, you can act out of love, out of duty, out of basic decency, but at the time when your own health and situation starts to be imperiled is the time to thank hard about what you are doing, what you can do to improve your own life.Swampy will tell it to you straight -- its tough to get good care from an unhappy caregiver.So what can you do?If your mother in law can be left alone for short periods, you need to think of activities you can do with your wife. Do you want to see a movie? Do you want to drive 20 miles out, lie on a park bench and just talk? How about fishing? (Swampy doesn't get fishing but to some people its a good time)...anyway, the point is, find something that the two of you can do together that will make your relationship stronger that in no way involves your MIL.The next thing you should do is hire someone to help your wife for for 3-6 hours per week. You might be lucky and score someone to help with caregiving, but given all that your wife does, someone to do some of the cleaning would be a help. You might also talk to your MIL's old church. Even if she hasn't been in years, they often have someone who can help you.Swampy hopes that you will keep us up to date, and wishes you the best.	post_2575681
post_2614942	Mar 08, 2008	209384	None	AR	Have you tried finding help from your church?    How about old friends of your mil's to come and sit with her while the two of you get some time off?    My grandmother had friends who were in much better shape that would come in and visit with her while my grandfather and us got away for some time to destress.    If there are friends around her age they don't usually judge or get their feathers ruffled very easily.    And in all likelihood she wouldn't treat them the way she does the 2 of you.Sounds like she may also need an anti-anxiety med.    This is pretty common with people who suffer from dementia.    They suffer from high levels of anxiety b/c of it and of course her other health problems.    Will also make her sleep a considerable number of hours a night so that you can both get a good night's rest.    And if she can't make it to the bathroom in the night, put a diaper on her.    Not the worst thing in the world to do to a person, I guarantee you.Good luck and remember:    The will of God will never take you where the Grace of God will not protect you.	post_2575681

Last night she made me so mad I ended up sitting at Easter dinner thinking, "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you." I didn't even feel that way about her when I was a teenager, but I'm beginning to now.Her energy is declining again after we built it up for a year, not due to excess weight loss and GI difficulties (got that all under control), but due to her sneaking more and more cigarettes, thus making her emphysema worse.Then she told me she wasn't going to go spend a couple of months with my sisters and her sisters in Alaska this year (I SO needed that) because traveling is just SO tiring for her now. In the same breath she broadly hinted she wanted to go with my husband and I to Mexico in a couple of years when we FINALLY go on our delayed honeymoon. How dare she invite herself along on my honeymoon! And expect me to run around taking care of her the whole time while she shops and drinks margaritas. NOT going to happen.I'm back to working on my garage hideaway now that the weather is warming up.	post_2575681
post_2714077	Mar 30, 2008	310108	None	to all care givers	i would like to commend all of you for taking care of a parent. It is not easy, i know as i have had my share,I have worked with people for 40 years and had to quit job for health issues I enjoyed ny work but i came home every night and it was not 24/7. also my husband is ,and has been invalid for 7 years .he dioes not walk, not even to the B.R i am not as young, as i used yo be, and i know that it can be hard on one. my mom passed    away 9 years ago, and my oldest daughter, passed away 7 years ago she was the one that could stand to be around the elderly and sick, I have a daughter 48, she lives far away, she has cancer, and i cant drive, so she will not have long i have to learn to accept this, as i did my older daughter, and beleive me it is not easy to think of it, now i have a daughter, she is the middle one    and age, 54, she has never been able to go into a hosp, or stand being around the sick, it is just that she cries and just cant do it,She has said mom i wish i could help, you and she does by running errends taking-her step dad to dr lots of things, we have talked about my health, and i told her, that no way would i let any of my children take care of me ,it is to big a burden, and they have their life to live, and when i get to where i cant take care of myself, for her not to feel bad, as i want to go to a nursing home, i would feel so bad, if she took care of me, i guess i am a funny person, i would rather a stranger do it. so it makes her feel easier, as she has health issues also, so if it gets to be to much for some of you talk to your, mom, or dad, and see if they would not rather go to a nursing home, I stll manage to take care of my husband and i do get so frustrated sometimes because he is a very demanding person so i know what all of you go through, and if you are young, i feel for you I really can not understand a parent being that selfish, because i feel so different about these things. I might not want to go, but if i cant take care of myself. it makes no difference to me where i am.I do wish all of you luck, and dont beat yourrself to death for feeling the way you do, it is normal/ I think that most of the problem with a permenent care giver is you have no time to go out ,and you get so depressed,so if any of you have health issues talk to the parent, maybe they would rather go to a nursing home        luck to all     jo    P.S.

post_2734581	Apr 03, 2008	470096	None	Everyone	What a horrible existance.. I know because this sounds just like my life.The stress and guilt if you simply walk away. Yeah right.My mother has been sick and dying since I was 4 - I'm 49 now & she is mostly incapacitated but still hanging on at age 87.She has been on some form of public assistance for as long as I can remember, lived with my older brother for 20 years prior to moving into 1 of my rental homes. (he was selling his house & she wouldn't let the realtors in so I had to make her the offer).My husband got a great job out of state, 1500 miles away & we sold 1 of the homes to make the move... that's when she moved into our home in this state. I travel across country 4 to 6 times a year responding to some form of tragedy & end up staying for months. I have no life of my own & am treated like dirt by this woman... yes, my Mother.She has always been negative, nasty & abusive but the guilt of what to do with her won't go away. My brother won't help now that he's "rid of her". I'm the one who is stuck. I want to be with my husband, I want to have a life but she refuses to go to a nursing home as recommended by her doctor.She is completely incontinent & uses a walker to get around but spends most of her days in bed. The Dr. prescribed anitdepressants and she has been taking them for YEARS! She is still the most negative, nasty, insulting perswon I have ever met.We are in a very small town with literally no resources avaialble for 85 miles. Most days I just want to walk away & never come back.This has done nothing but take it's toll on me & my health but I have nowhere to turn.No, there is no church group. No there are no senior facilities. No there are no other caregivers and no other family that will have anything to do with her & her mean self.She has 9 brothers & sisters 6 arer still living & none of them will talk to her - she has burnt every bridge in her life & made everyone mad that she has met.She has no money, no assets - and I cannot afford to continue to support her. But what do I do? Who do I tell?As you can tell I'm at my wits end & it appears there is no light at the end of the tunnel.	post_2575681

I do wish you lots of luck, but sometimes we have to do what is best for mom, and if the dr says it is best then try not to go with the guilt trip     luck    jo	post_2575681
post_2761581	Apr 10, 2008	465121	None	Everyone interested in this subject	First of all, know that I am an Occupational Therapist who works in home health and deal with this problem EVERY single day.    At the same time, I was a caregiver for my father for 6 years and now my mother for the past 12 years.    I have MUCH empathy and personal/professional experience that I could write non-stop for 24 hours per day 7 days a week and 365 days a year, but I won't bore you.    I'll keep this post short and highlight some pointers.Often times, people get caught up by trying to be good doers and quickly get in over their head.    The people we take care of have rights, but so do caregivers.    It usually comes down to power and control issues.Know:1) You must set clear boundaries as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.    Once set, there are no room for give and take.2) It's important to ask for help instead of trying to do everything yourself.    If other family members are involved and not pulling their share, then you must be specific in asking for help AND delegating specific tasks.3) If your spouse is involved everyone helping MUST be on the same page for the benefit of your relationship.    So, the two of you NEED to talk and agree on the situation at hand.NOTE:    Don't forget to make a date with your spouse to keep your relationship healthy, even if it's a date for a cup of tea and the ONLY goal is to focus on one another.    Also important for this to be non sexual or the main caregiver will feel this is ONE more thing they must do. I promise the intimacy will benefit if you do this.4) It's OK to say NO to unreasonable behavior and NOT feel guilty over setting limits especially if the person can't set it for theirself.5) Pick your battles carefully.    Choose over standing for the important things and let the non important things go for another day.    Usually, it's the no-important things that drive us absolutely nutz.6) Start slowly in making changes to benefit YOU.    Rome wasn't conquered in a day.    Start with one task at a time and the next day do a little more.7)    It's OK to ask for outside help with specific tasks, but this means you must let go and let someone else do the task..8) There is a book called the 36 hour day written specifically for caregivers.    It's a must have to read.9)    Most states have a respite care program.    Check with county/state/local aging centers for information.10) If the situation is so out of hand and you truly have had it, then talk to the doctor and put it in his/her hands.    If the doctor says this must be done, then it's out of your hands and it MUST be done.    Let the person be mad at the doctor and talk to them.    Know health care professionals deal with this ALL the time.    It really helps if we know that the caregiver wants intervention.    It's even more important that the recommendations be followed up if you seek our help.11) Learn how to unarm a power struggle before it becomes an issue.    There is much literature on the net and local library.I'll take my own advice and start slow with my suggestions.    Try these 11 things first, let me know how it goes.    I'll check back often now that I've found this site.Good luck,Reirei	post_2575681

post_3739483	Dec 05, 2008	703283	213044	AR-10	I like how honest you seem to be and how much you care about your wife.    Your MIL sounds like my mom kind of, or how she used to be.    She's bipolar and is currently being taken care of by her parents, who are in their 80s and not doing very well.    She has always been depressing to be around, but she kind of went off the deep end a few years ago and started, for lack of a better word, destroying everyone and everything around her.    I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with her when she becomes my responsibility, but I cannot live with her.    Ever.    She drives me crazy, in a literal sort of way.    Nothing wrong with knowing your boundaries, I guess.    My heart goes out to you and your wife.    Please know that nothing lasts forever, no matter how awful.    And no matter how hard a time she is having or how her mother might make her feel about her or about herself and regardless of what happens later, the fact that your wife has made it this long shows how strong and good she is.    I hope she knows that.    I don't really have anything helpful to say, just that I hope you both know how good you are.    Sometimes it helps to know that.	post_2575681
post_2501768	Feb 12, 2008	144586	None	None	Over the years I have noticed something very upsetting. There is less and less emphasis on touching, caressing and holding. In the bible there are words concerning "the laying on of hands". There is absolutely nothing more therapeutic than a touch on the shoulder of a grasp on the wrist. I have little sweet-heart who turned 103 years old today and she was recently in the hospital for five days and not a single physician touched her shoulder or nheld her hand. Neither did a nurse. And this was a geriatric facility. And when I visit a bursing home I see aides paid good salaries sitting on the other side of the room 24/7 instead of sitting next to their charges holding their wrists. When you visit the ill or elderly or someone in your care maximize human contact. If you are in the room, sit down and hold their wrists. Put your hand on their shoulder. Caress them. Decades ago I was in a terrible situation enroute to a hospital with a blood loss. The one thing I remember that made me hang on was the emergency medical technician who placed her hand on my shoulder and her other hand on my wrists and never let go. Yes. That stands out in my mind.    There is an actual bias against touching and holding these days. Children who have been in terrible accidents are picked up by ambulance crews and not caressed because of "fear of liability". I don't want to hear "this doesn't happen." It does. And it is a crime against humanity. I was recently hospitalized and in the morning along came a bunch of med students with their compyer laptops. Fat, dumb and happy arrogant know it alls. They went through an entire ward of critically ill patients (including me) without touching ANYONE. Neither did their resident "mentor". As they left I asked a question. "What is your question," asked a young Chinese girl tapping information into her laptop as she spoke. "How many boxtops did you send in to get admitted to medical school?" I asked innocently. The criterion for admission to medical schools these days is to admit idiot-savants. The most important medicine of all is to maintain the will to live. And that will is generated by kindness and caring and the transfer of the life-force. And this energy can only be conveyed by holding, touching a gentle caressing. Never be embarrassed to do this. You can never hold, touch or kissing a dying person too many times.	post_2501712

I would have loved to know what her life was like. I have chills thinking about it.I did caregiving in my life, once with my dearest friend who was dying of AIDS, and also with my dad, and finally my mom. I DO know the therapeutic value of touching. It goes without saying and I pray that if I ever need help..someone reaches out to me.Again, thank you for the beautiful post. Also, thank you for getting this forum going. I think it is going to be a wonderful place for advise and shared experiences.God Bless.	post_2501712
post_2503804	Feb 13, 2008	214105	None	caregiver	Thank you for reminding us about the importance of touch. I watch my children and for them touch is a natural part of showing their emotions. I feel as if our culture and society robs you of that and makes it awkward and uncomfortable. I remember once talking to a person that had immigrated to the US from Africa and he said that he attended a cultural training where they told them not to touch people because you need to respect people's personal space in America. This respect for personal space can sometimes impede our ability to connect, to share, to love....Thank you for reminding me of this.	post_2501712
post_2516981	Feb 15, 2008	421279	None	caregiver	I can not agree with you more.    I myself have been a care giver to my sister with breast cancer.    I spent alot of time at the hospital (paliative care) with her and watched people die with no one there to visit or just sit with them.    On my sisters good days I would leave her to visit these people.    I would back cookies and offer to those who could eat or just sit and talk.    The rest I would at least hold their hand and tell them a friend is here.    My sister knew what I was doing and thanked me from the bottom of her heart.    She said she does not think she could have handled it if no one would touch her so she could feel the comfort and she had bone cancer that had spread from breast cancer.    So sister was in LOTS of pain and still wanted touch.    People please stop and think.    What would you want?	post_2501712
post_2551778	Feb 23, 2008	144586	None	None	It has been a bad week and I ended up in a hospital in somewhat critical condition and I thought about my bad luck. And as I lay on the bed screams came from the other room. Terrifying screams. There were nurses on duty and I went to them. They were all reading magazines. I asked them about the screaming patient, and they said: "we gave him morphine. He has mental problems." They had closed the door to his room. I was somewhat contagious with a lung infection so borrowed a mask and left my room. The ward was filled with those who suffer the indignities of war. The late Wilfred Owen wrote a poem:"He sat in a wheelchair, waiting for dark,And shivered in his ghastly suit of grey,Legless, sewn short at the elbow,Voices of Boys, saddening like a hymn,Voices of play and pleasure after day,Till gathering sleep hadmothered them from him,Tonight he noticed how the women's eyes,Passed from him to the strongmen that were whole."So entered his room and he was clearly dying. Alone in the ward.Upon the desk was a childs card and apromotional brochure from the school that sent it as part of "work for the community". But none of them visited. And the nurses sat each nighyt at therir station reading the same tattered magazines and chatting about their boiyfriends. And every night he screamed. The little television sets had news shows about people cheering football teams.So I stayed with him night after night holding him tightly. And the screaming stopped.And I thought perhaps the life-force had a reason for making me so sick and bringing me to this point in time on the space continuum.My purpose in being at this hospital was to hold this soldier.	post_2501712

I don't do anything without giving a hug or a caress on the back.    I kiss them on the forehead every night when I tuck them into bed.    They need it so badly!    They have less behaviors, and are much happier and willing when they get hugs and kisses!    I have one resident that is very combative with the other staff.    She has never once laid a hand on me because I always give her a big hug before I do anything else with her.	post_2501712
post_2655398	Mar 17, 2008	144586	None	None	My little 103 year old sweetheart became dehydrated. I took her to a hospital and she said: "I'm so scared. Please hold me and kiss me." I did so from her bedside, kissing her onloy on the cheek, the nurse walked in, and informed me "that is inappropriate behavior". I was banned from visiting her, escorted out by security, and she is close to death, and may soon lose sentience. She may not. It is in the hands of the life-force. She is surrounded by strangers and refuses to permit her blood pressure to be taken. She gladly allowed me to take it daily for three years. I have been her only visitor every day for the last three years for from four to twelve hours a day. She has one relative that, for various reasons, rarely visits, and then only to look in the door. She is dying along. The hospital staff won't talk to me and caregiver 222 is crying. The penalty for giving a hug to a dying friend.	post_2501712
post_2657601	Mar 17, 2008	144586	None	None	Another day passes while my little one lies alone in her hospital bed, frightened out of her mind. They don't know how to feed her, which compounds her swallowing difficulties. I have been with her for three years seven days a week, four weeks a month, twelve months a year with ten days off in three years. Feeding her over hours some daya, but they don't want my opinion. They know everything. And I am not a relative with standing. And cuddling a dying woman is against hospital rules. The aide put the telephone to her ears and as I told her "I love you" she beamed. What a way to say good-bye. Caregiver went to church this afternoon and in the mighty cathedral prayed. Caregiver222 hasn't done that in a long while. And they won't let me in.I used to hold her in my arms and read her poerty.Before the Phantom of False morning died,Methought a Voice within the tavern cried,"When all the temple is prepared within,Why nods the drousy worshipper outside?"And, as the **** crew, those who stood beforeThe Tavern shouted -- "Open then the door!"You know how little while we have to stay,And once departed may return no more,Come, fill the cup, and in the Fire of SpringYour Winter Garden of Repentence Fling,The Bird ofg Time has but a little way,To flutter --- and lo...the bird is on the wing.Lo, some we loved, the lovliest and the best,That time and Fate of all their vintage prest,Have drunk their cup a Round or Two before,And one by one crewpt silently to the door,And we, that now make merry in the room,They left, and summer dresses in new bloom,Ourselves must we beneath the Couch of EarthDescend ourselves, to make a couch, for whom?Up from the Earths Center through the Seventh gate,I rose and on the throne of saturn sate,And many knots unraveled by the road,But not the knot of human death and fate,The moving finger writes,And having writ moves on,And all your piety and wit,Can erase a single word nor change a line.I don't think she is going to make it out of the hospital. Perhaps not, but things don't look very heartening. When I brought her in the doctor said "She will die here or die at home...why don't you take her home".I believe her swallowing problem can be treated, as I have been treating it for the last three years. It is no worse now then it was three years ago. The treatment reminds me of the concentration camps at Belsen and Auschwitz. But of course back then people were only "following orders".I have no anger towards these physicians with their arrogance. Forgive those who trespass against us. But upon her passing caregiver222 will post no more, My apologies to those I have offended and the best of luck to those who have found some comfort from my words.God is great.	post_2501712

"Nay, not so,"Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,But cheerly still, and said "I pray thee, then,Write me as one that loves his fellow men."The angel wrote, and vanished.

I'm fortunate enough to be able to visit with her each evening. The aides there always comment about how I sit right on the bed with her, and have contact with her during the visit. I hold her hands, rub her arms or her feet, or just stroke her face as much as I can. I do this until she falls asleep if I can. I feel much better when I leave her sleeping peacefully.	post_2501712

post_3373560	Sep 07, 2008	612302	None	None	I too feel so much for you and completely understand. November 2007, my fiance was in a horrible dirtbike accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury.    His "recovery" as of now includes left side paralysis, troubled speach, cognitive deficits, the list could go on.    He requires 24 hour home care which I have been thrown into at the age of 28 at the time!    He obviously lost his job and I had to quit mine because we can't afford to hire a caregiver, insurance doesn't cover it and his family won't help out financially (or me emotionally for that matter). Our roles have completely changed, and unfortunately, unlike you, I have little to no help at all from his family and my family is on the other side of the country.There have been times that I've felt anger and resentment, loss and grief over my own personal losses in this.    He's older than me and there are times, I do not lie, that I get mad that I don't get to have all the experiences that he has had, that I feel like life was ripped away from me too.    I have not had the chance to have children yet, to travel the world, to do so much that he has already had the opportunity to do and that we were planning on doing together.    Instead, I am in the role essentially of not only being his partner, but also his parent.    But, I do my best to sit back and realize, this is hell for him too.    To be so active and full of life one moment and confined to a wheelchair the next not able to do anything for yourself.    I read a great statement by Dana Reeve in that you need to grieve for your loss and then realize that it is by choice that I am his caregiver, to stand by him, love him, care for him and not walk out that door, leaving him to the "system".    I have to remind myself of that statement everytime I feel I'm losing it.Luckily, he still has much of the personality he had before and we are able to still hold conversations, laugh and make jokes, discuss our futures and generally enjoy eachother's company. He tries so hard to make life easier, to show me affection, to tell me he loves me and to generally be conscious of how hard this is for me to (although, because of the brain injury at times he just feels this is my job).    He understands what is happening and does his best to try to help even though at times its hard to tell that he's even doing that.    But, we hold onto dreams of getting through this, of him getting more independence and of fighting for more "recovery" whatever that may hold.    It sounds like you have been going through your plight longer than I have.    I'm not sure about your situation, but we do still have hope of further recovery, of him being able to walk again and maybe even able to move his left arm again.    That doesn't mean that I don't feel like an island.    His brothers and sisters treat me horribly and think that I'm staying home and asking for financial help to pay the bills because I don't WANT to work, but not willing to help with caregiving so that I could go back to work.    They have no idea how hard this is, how draining emotionally and physically it is.    I've tried asking for their help, for delegating needs and tasks, for which I get nothing in return. Heck, I would even be happy if they just took time to communicate and spend time with their brother - who feels the brunt of it and goes through so much depression because he feels he has no support.    I don't care how they treat me, I can handle it, I'm used to dealing with difficult people from my previous profession, but I do care about what effect it has on him. He can't process it and all of his emotions are left on his sleeve.    But, If I think about it too much, it just angers me, so I've stopped trying to reach out to them.    It's better for the both of us.There are so many other things to worry about that I know you've probably had experience with - dealing with insurance companies, claims, medical advocacy, social security disability, medicaid applications and appeals, on and on. It's a never ending cycle.    Anyway, just wanted to share my journey and let you know that you are not alone either!    Best to you and if you ever want to talk or share experiences, I would be so happy!    It's nice having someone else who understands.	post_2709593

Geare,and if you want others to help you with this put to J.S Geare And all in column, i think he will put you in the right direction, also i have read in B.P D column. also abuse about these meds but i am sure. I think the best bet would be anxiety to J.S. gear and all in columns he is a very educated person and helps the med help group    i wish you the best     jo	post_2746323

post_2754921	Apr 08, 2008	310108	472634	Devin377	Hi Devin,The reason that i suggested, another column is. that mostly the elderly post on this about problems with taking care of their Elderl parents, and you Post will not get read,I realize you did not mention Anxiety.There are a lot of people that are schizo, in the other columns.I have worked with gen, State Mental    people for 40 year, and am not a therapist or nurse, I have seen many people as you describe, and certain    meds can do it.If your son can function on his own, no you do not have to be a caregiver, but if he cant, he needs someone ,and as i have not taken these meds i can not say what they will do, because each person, is different, also you mentioned Alsohol poisioing not sure if you are saying that he was drinking or just what?I have seen many many people that have had    mental problem, they can take meds and, get on with their lives and live by themselves some can not function on their own,I guess, only the Dr, can ans this,but there are all different kinds of meds out there, that can help. like i said you will get more answers on another column, as this is for caregivers, mostly for the elderly . If you dont want to post in another column, you will just have to tell the dr, how the meds make your son feel I do know Anxiety, Depression, and drinking, also many other issues leads to a mental problem, but thet can be helped maybe another Dr might help / I wish you lots of luck wish that i could be of more help         jo	post_2746323
post_2805959	Apr 20, 2008	486182	None	devin377	This may sound unreal but I want to share this with you, I was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia 16 yr ago now I find out that I was having hypnagogic hallutionations with sleep paralysis and other sleep related problems, If someone don't get enough sleep they can also have auditory hallutionations along with being scared to sleep etc. the meds for schiz works because it helps me go into a deeper sleep. I would have a sleep study done. Also a good web-site if your son does have schiz is www.****.com it will let you know of many alternative treatments that your son can use WITH his meds. sincerely huneybee41	post_2746323
post_2805975	Apr 20, 2008	486182	None	devin377	The meds are supposed to help but sometimes they don't do a real good job at it Clozapine is the best, However, the side effects can be dangerous but most people do not suffer the side effects and the patient is monitored closely with blood test CBC's weekly at first then biweekly then monthly and monthly as long as the person is on the meds. This may be something you would like to check out Sincerely huneybee41	post_2746323

post_3268940	Aug 12, 2008	585414	472634	Devin377	Actually typical antipsychotics are quite capable of causing a physical disorder caused tardive dyskanesia that is permanent and damaging and at its worse as in me similar to Parkinson's. The newer, atypical antipsychotics are much less likely to cause it and you should speak to a psychiatrist about having him transferred to Abilify which is the least likely to cause that and the "zombie like" effect you described as well as the temporary movement disorders such as akathesia (though its still a risk, the only medication that can't cause tardive is Clozaril which has its own hazards or the experimental Phase II glutamate inhibitors in study lik glycine which I'm on which will replace all treatments eventually as FDA studies pan out). Psychiatric treatment in prison is terrible. He needs a case manager, a social worker and a therapist in addition to a quality psychiatrist.	post_2746323

post_3023609	Jun 10, 2008	174368	295537	sweetchecks	It is very hard being a caregiver. My Mother had dementia, we never put her in a nursing home - I made a promise to my parents years ago.    My Father would care for her in ther morning - I would come over about 4 in the afternoon and stay over night - change my mother    and clean her up from her acidents I would leave their house about 9 to 10 in the morning so my dad could sleep.    I would take their laundry home and wash it for them.    My mother went through many sheets as I would not put a diaper on her as this would make her skin break down    and get sore. After my Mother passed away (I quit my job to care for her - I am also married and have two children and 2 grandchildren.)    Shortly after my Father fell outside and hit his head - bitter cold outside, his body temp. very low - they did not think he would pull out of it - so I quit my job again took care of him until he got on his feet - two months later in went in for cartoid artery surgery to prevent from having a stroke - well he had a stroke on the table. The doctors only gave him one month to live.    I quit my job again.    Made my living room into my Fathers bedroom as I have a two story house.. I did therapy, exercises, bathing, pureed his food, thickened his liquids, changed his cathater drainage bag, wiped his butt, cut his hair EVERYTHING- I even took him for car rides - it took me along time to get him into the car but it was worth it. The one month that the doctors gave him turned into 3 YEARS. Yes 3 years of my life, missing things with my kids or grandkids, friends- you really find out who your true friends are when it gets tough. My husband in the beginning said why don't you and your dad move - I said fiine with me- THIS IS MY FATHER AND I AM GOING TO CARE FOR HIM UNTIL THE END NO MATTER WHO LIKES IT OR WHO DON'T.    Well, after 3 yrears my Father slipped into a coma in his bedrom at my house - that coma lasted a week then he passed away a week later. TO THIS VERY DAY OF MY LIFE I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN. I AM 50 YEARS OLD, YES I MISSED OUT ON THINGS IN MY LIFE BUT WE STILL HAVE TIME TO ENJOY THINGS, MY DAD WAS 84 WHEN HE PASSED AWAY - IT WILL BE 4 MONTHS ON JUNE 15 THAT HE HAS BEEN GONE. I TREASURE ALL THOSE SPECIAL TIMES THAT WE HAD TOGETHER, MEMORIES THAT WE SHARED AND MEMORIES THAT WE MADE. I HAVE THAT IN MY HEAD AND IN MY HEART FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THAT NOBODY CAN TAKE AWAY FROM ME. I ONLY HAVE THESE MEMORIES NOT MY SISTERS, THEY TOO LIVED CLOSE BY.    PROMISES ARE MADE TO HELP BUT THAT DOES NOT COME TO PASS, SO YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE FUN , ENJOYABLE DAYS TOGETHER AND MAKE MEMORIES THAT YOU TOO WILL ALWAYS HAVE IN YOUR HEAERT AND HEAD. YOU HAVE MANY YEARS OF LIFE AHEAD OF YOU - YOUR MOTHER PROBABLY DOES NOT AND IT DOES NOT LAST FOREVER.    CHERISH YOUR SPECIAL TIME WITH HER. I WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN IF I HAD TO , EVEN IF THER ONE MONTH TURNED INTO 3 YEARS.    I WISH I HAD MORE TIME TO MAKE MORE MEMORIES WITH MY FATHER BUT I DON'T.    AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, SOMETIMES PATIENTS CAN GET SHORT, BUT YOU MUST STEP BACK AND THINK - OF THE LOVE AND CARE THAT HOPEFULLY YOUR PARENTS GAVE YOU WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE- NOW IT'S YOUR TURN BUT FOR A SHORTER TIME. yOUR QUOTE WAS "i have no life" - well MAKE ONE FOR YOU AND INCLUDE YOUR MOTHER.    yOU CAN NOT IMAGINE THE THINGS YOU COULD DO WITH YOUR MOTHER TO MAKE THE DAY GO BY AND SPEND QUALITY TIME WITH HER.    I WOULD NEVER JUST PUT MY DAD IN HIS ROOM AND TELL HIM TO WATCH TV. - I STIMULATED HIS MIND AND I TURN IT HELPED ENRICH MY MIND AND MY LIFE.    GOD I MISS HIM SO MUCH.    I NOW HAVE TIME TO MAKE MEMORIES WITH MY GRANDKIDS, KIDS, HUSBAND ETC. BUT I ALSO HAVE A HAPPY HEART KNOWING THAT MY MOTHER AND FATHER WERE TAKEN CARE OF BY THE BEST - Me!!    YOUR    TIME WILL COME FOR YOU - TELL YOUR MOTHER EVERYTHING GOOD THAT YOU FEEL FOR HER IN YOUR HEART, TELL HER YOU LOVE HER AND HOW SPECIAL OF MOTHER SHE IS - IT DOES NOT TAKE MUCH TO MAKE AN ELDERLY PERSON HAPPY ESPECIALLY IF IT IS YOUR PARENT AND THAT SHOULD COME FROM THE HEART ANYWAY.    ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT I AM SOOOOOO    HAPPY THAT I GAVE MY FATHER 3 GOOD YEARS, WITH GOOOD CARE, LAUGHS, PLAYING GAMES, SITTING IN HIS BEDROOM WATCHING MOVIES WITH HIM, TAKING HIM TO VETREN PARADES,    ETC. - USE YOUR IMAGINATION WITH HER AND YOU WILL HAVE FUN , MEMORIES AND MOST OF ALL MAYBE YOU CAN MAKE HER LAUGH, AND WHEN SHE DOES PASS AWAY YOU WILL HAVE ALL THESE WONDERFUL THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AND REAMEMBER    THAT WILL BE WITH YOU UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE.	post_2615304

post_2859187	May 02, 2008	479347	465121	Reirei	Thank you for your helpful suggestions. I will certainly refer to them as needed.My husband and I just took a short walk together and it was quit enjoyable and took some of    the pressure off It has been very hard for me to remember that I am here to support him and not be a martyr. I try to remember when he becomes moody and at times rude to me that it is not the man I love but the Interferon treatment that he is on. I have to not take it so personaly    and walk away from the situation before I say things I may regret.I work in a Nursing Home so I do deal with illness on a daily basis and am very compassionate which makes it easier to deal with this nightmareI will try to follow your recommendations    and once again thank you for sharing your experience	post_2761594
post_2860257	May 03, 2008	465121	479347	nannyleenie	I highly commend the task you have undertaken to work in a nursing home, AND to be a caregiver for your husband.    You stated, "I deal with illness on a daily basis."    It seems to me you are dealing with illness on a 24 hour basis.    It's even MORE important that you take time for yourself in doing something other than helping.    Like that walk you took with your husband was an excellent way to remove yourself from the role of caregiver and simply enjoy the presence of nature and another person's company.    It would be nice if you were able to take that retreat to pamper yourself on a daily basis.    Surely, it would be wonderful to go to a day spa and have your nails, hair, and body pampered by someone else, but most of us don't have the money or can't afford the luxury of time away.    Maybe, you can find 30-60 minutes a day to focus on YOU and ONLY YOU!!!!Another thing that might help you deal with those frustrating moments is to keep a journal.    I'm the type of person that has a slow verbal response at times.    For example, if someone says something in a negative way to me I don't always have a quick comeback, but after thinking about it for a few minutes, I beat myself up and say "I should have said this/that" which only sets me to put myself down.The one thing that caregivers need at times is to have someone listen to THEM and their woes.    Keeping a journal will do that for you.    It will give you a release of those negative feelings or difficult situations.    Sometimes I need to simply talk out loud and weigh the options to help me figure out what's best.    Journaling does this for me.    I found when I first started to journal was with my cup of tea in the mornings (my time).    Especially at first, I wrote forever (so it seemed) and cried even more.    As I became more empowered and stronger to make better decisions I found that I only needed to write during those difficult times.    When things became better, it was nice to see where I had come.On an ending note, my first post noted a book called the 36 hour day that's a must have for caregivers.    One thing I failed to note was this book was written for caregivers dealing with alzheimer's.    Surely, the book is very well written for this population.    At the same time, caregivers who are dealing with other situations can benefit from it too.Good luck and don't forget to take time FOR YOU!!! everyday!!!Hugs,Reirei	post_2761594
post_2876156	May 07, 2008	418676	None	None	Thank you for your words. I just had a HUGE fight with my mother and we haven't spoken to each other for a day and a half. And yes, of course it was about control issues.Lucky for me, my mother is still in an "assisted living" level of health, with ME of course being her assisted living person. With fairly advanced emphysema, she has major energy issues, which have reduced her to only managing to fix herself tea and snacks, fold laundry if I put it in front of her, walk her dog slowly around the block, drive around the corner to the store, water a couple of plants on the porch (she keeps having me plant more and more things that she can't take care of), occasionally plant a bulb or two, and do crossword puzzles.My mother is a major packrat, and she has such poor kitchen habits that she could turn a kitchen into a biological red zone in a matter of weeks left to her own devices. The whole reason we moved her in with us was because she was basically killing herself with spoiled food, constant inside smoking, and lack of sunshine.My issues, other than the general issue of having my annoying mother as a permanent roommate, have to do with her expecting me and my husband to do dozens of tasks for her all the time without ever thinking about how she is affecting OUR life. I have come to HATE the phrase, "would you mind...?" I don't mind changing her sheets, because that is physically too difficult for her. But I do mind being treated as an errand girl. I have finally come up with a partial solution to that problem. Now I have mom write a day on the calendar that she wants me to run her around for errands. That way I can plan the rest of my days without her incessant "as long as you are going out, would you mind..."And I mind that I can't vacuum or dust her room because it is a mess. The last time I did a good cleaning to get rid of winter mildew, spider webs, etc., she didn't say thank you. She demanded to know where I had put some little scrap of paper that was important to her.So she can just live with all that dust and dog hair. I'm not going back in there.And I'm tired of her getting pissy periodically when she goes looking for something and can't find it, even though I spend all my time arranging the house so that all her stuff is easily available yet out of my way. Last time it was something in the gardening stuff, which is all in one place in the garage except for the stuff on the porch that we use all the time. Instead of saying to me, "I was looking for the whatsit in the garage and couldn't find it. Do you know where it is?", she said, in a really snippy tone, "I was looking for something in the garden stuff and it wasn't there, and I got REALLY MAD." Yeah, well good for you, mom.And she got mad at both me and husband over the bread tie. Did she ever once say to me, "I can't use these plastic bread things with my arthritis. I need twisty ties, so save them when you see them."? No, of course not. Instead, as she was fighting with a plastic bread thing, she snapped at both of us about how much she HATES those things and why can't there be any twisty ties around.	post_2761594
post_2876159	May 07, 2008	418676	None	None	continuation of my rant...Anyway, the fight we got into was about me shredding something of hers with her new shredder. My mother is buried in paper because she won't throw anything out. And her shredder broke a couple of years ago so account documents, tax documents, etc have stacked up. Over the last year and a half, as I have done my usual moving of her current stack of papers on the table to her office table and computer, I have seen certain things come in regularly that she never even opens. EVER. One of those is some health insurance statements that she gets once or twice a month. Never once have I seen her open one of those. They just stack up in various piles. She doesn't even remove the envelopes for recycling so that the piles aren't as high. That particular set of unopened envelopes were obviously destined for the shredder. A year ago, or even 6 months ago, I would have asked her and double checked that it was okay to shred them. But after a year and a half of stacking them, unopened, I no longer felt the need to go through the annoying process of asking her about anything to do with her piles of ****, so I was testing the shredder by running through some of the specific unopened stuff. She came roaring in and started YELLING at me about "her" stuff and me not asking permission, and me mixing up stuff on her office table (the slob packrat accusing the neat freak of messing up the piles that the neat freak has been keeping stacked). I said that I was just shredding the unopened things she had stacked up for over a year and wasn't "messing with" her real paperwork and was not "mixing up" her piles. She didn't hear a word I said and just started ranting about how mad I would be if she touched my stuff (actually, if she had noticed for a year and a half that I was stacking up unopened mail from the same source, and had decided to shred it, I probably would have thanked her). So of course I started yelling back at her about how I would never touch her stupid stuff again and that SHE could now shred the mountain of papers she had stacked up, oh and by the way, she could also shred the two boxes of tax stuff in the garage, and oh, by the way, her stupid laundry is STILL in the garage where I put it because she wanted to do that batch herself because of items that needed to be sprayed or not dried but that was 5 days previous. And then I slammed a bunch of doors and threw one of her tax boxes in the office. And we haven't spoken since.My mother's control freak behavior hides behind her slobby packrat behavior, but it is definitely there. When she moved in with us (we had just completed an interstate move, the second in three years, so I was really sick of packing, moving, and unpacking), she hired a couple of college students to help her pack. That involved micromanaging everything they did, which slowed the process way down. And when she could have been sitting at her computer table sorting her writing and papers while she micromanaged the kids, she did nothing. So when she ran out of time, I was the one who had to come over and pack all the rest of her apartment (about half of it) and clean the entire place by myself. That included me very carefully stacking her writing together and putting it in a labeled box. Well, months later, when mom finally felt like digging through that particular box, she had one of her hissy fits about how the papers weren't stacked in the right order. I'm still mad about that. What a load of ****. You don't like the way I packed the box? Then you should have packed it yourself.Then, when we had to use her table at thanksgiving, she was too busy socializing to walk into the office and stack stuff the way she wanted. So a couple of weeks after thanksgiving she finally notices that the stuff on her table isn't EXACTLY the way she left it (how the hell can an oblivious slob packrat even tell?) and starts one of her pissy rants about "her" stuff. I simply reminded her that we had had to use the table and she hadn't felt the need to come back and police the moving of her ****.Does this all sound like a bunch of petty stuff? Sure it does. But as most people who have to move a parent in know, it's the little petty stuff that makes you crazy (short trip, as my husband says). I keep thinking about how mom's energy level is less than it was last year, and it is going to be less next year, and her level of care will have to keep escalating, and how am I going to keep from killing her before she dies. I do know that she is hoping for a quick demise rather than a slow downward spiral, because she has some fear of being "dependent" on people (what a joke. She's one of the most dependent people I know, and has been for many years).My husband is now refusing to walk her dog anymore, mostly because mom started EXPECTING it, like she starts expecting everything.So, after this long long rant (gotta rant to people who know, poor hubby gets enough of it) comes the good part. I get to escape for 7 weeks. HUGE preparation effort involved in leaving my mom alone for 7 weeks, but this may be the last time I can be gone that long without hiring an actual care person. So to get ready to leave her alone, I rearrange the entire kitchen so that her stuff is all out on the counters and shelves in her reach (she already has 4 easy access storage shelves in the kitchen for all of her pills and supplements and goodies. All screw on or glass food storage jars replaced with plastic containers with pop off lids. Im filling the freezer and pantry with single serving food and easy make stuff. In the yard we have to set up splitters on all the faucets and run soaker hoses all over the yard, because mom can't unscrew hose attachments and she can't drag a hose around the yard. The hanging plants will probably die, because she can't lift them down and can't lift a hose or water can up to them.Her friends have all been notified that she will be alone for 7 weeks. I've asked mom to ask a couple of her friends to help with changing her sheets. I have a cleaning service coming in twice while we are gone, but of course they won't do dishes or sheets. We are taking our cats with us so that she only has her dog to worry about.I knew moving mom in with us was going to be difficult, on a mother/daughter level, on a roommate level, and on a caregiver level. But you can never really picture the reality until you are in it. I'm hoping my 7 week break will keep me sane enough for a while to keep on dealing.	post_2761594
post_2881418	May 08, 2008	465121	None	Mamaboulet	A HUGE hug to you sister!!!!!    and I do mean sister because I swear we HAVE THE SAME MOTHER!!!    In my case and to make things more challenging my mother has 2 sisters who visit 2-3 times a week and are even worse.    What the sisters can't use, they bring to my mother especially in the way of flea market finds, clothes, and food/packets.    Everytime we would open the refrigerator we had a 3 minutes clean up of all the little packets that would fall to the floor.    God forbid we throw something away that the sisters brought.    I would swear my mother counted the soy sauce packets every night to see if we threw any away.Forgive me, but I had to chuckle several times throughout your post.    Not because of your plight, but because of the familiarity of the situation to my mother and her sisters who are all in their 80's - the depression refugee's.    They feel that if something is useful/functional/still in good working order then it can NEVER be thrown away and someone/somewhere can use it.    Their goal is to simply find it a good home.    I wish I could post a picture of the dirty ugly stuffed handmad rooster that made it into my home this week that was purchased at a flea market for 50 cents.    If you have ever seen the movie the YaYa Sisterhood you will see my mother and her 2 sisters.    Hence, my nickname for them "The YaYa's".Fortunately/unfortuately, we are NOT alone.    As a therapist, I deal with this situation everytime there is a parent/child/caregiver relationship.    Most are not to our extreme's, some ARE worse if you can imagine.    This is one of the situations where it's time for us to be the parent, set limits or consequences, and our parent must now be seen (not treated) as the child.From your post, I'm not sure if you just needed to vent (which is a good thing), or if you were looking for help.I can only tell you what has worked for me.    I have learned from my husband who is better at setting limits than I am.    I tend to go for the reward system - you give me what I want (something big, but reasonable).    For example, I'll say "If you clean off the top of your dresser, I'll take you to lunch or bingo."    My husband has set space limitations.    For example, he has NO problem saying and meaning "What ever fits into your room is yours and you can keep.    Whatever has to be shared in my space I get to have a say in where it goes."    He is also VERY good about designating HIS SPACE.    We've had to modify those rules to accommodate everyone.    For example, my mother has a door that goes to a private porch off her room.    It's also a benefit in case of an emergency or fire, there's a fire escape.    When a safety factor is involved there is NO ROOM for give and take.    We had to be firm with my mother and say "You need to have a clear path for you and your walker to this door in the event of a fire, if you can't or won't do it, THEN I WILL!!!!"    Once a month I get her to show me that her and her walker can make it to that door with no problem.    It's very hard for me NOT to comment further on the room filled with "treasures".For us, it has also helped in getting her own little refrigerator for those little food packets that make it's way into our hose.    It has also been a blessing for it gives me the opportunity to give her what she does best, is mother.    After doing some task around the house, I'll sit down and talk and mention that I sure could go for a cold drink.    Not that I want her to wait on me, but it brings such pleasure to her to get up out of her chair and bring me a cold drink from HER refrigerator.    I also try to find small projects for her to do around the house.    It's even better if we get to do them together, like peeling potatos.    I'll say to her, I'm making a pot of soup, how about I set you up at the table and would you peel some potatos for me.    It gives her a purpose, a sense of helping.    I liked your idea about giving your mother a basket of laundry to fold.    One important note, if you give her something to do and she attempts to help, you CANNOT make any negative comments.At some neutral point, I was able to sit down and talk/listen to my mom about our different styles of living to try to come up with a solution that would make everyone happy.    I truly took to heart the suggestions she made to make living together more tolerable.    I also try to take characteristics of what's important to her and emphasize a further importance.    For example, My mother also likes to stock pile papers, especially crafts and coupons that are never used.    I've said to her "I know of a center that is looking for yarn to make for homeless children.    Will you go through your stuff to see if you have anything to help?"    You would be surprised to see how many bags of yarn came out of that room because she knew that it was going to a good home.What she didn't know or see the things that I went through and threw away because of embarrassment I would have in giving it in such poor condition (like that ugly rooster).    I do the same thing when I give her an empty container to fill that could be stored in the attic or garage.    Some things go to the attic some hit the trash.    She thinks her things are safely stored, I know things are where they need to be to keep my sanity.    Rarely, does she ever ask for anything that has been stored in this manner.Maybe, in reading my rants you can get some ideas to creatively set up win-win situation which will go the farther distance.    One last note, in your post I didn't see you state anything that you and your mom did together that would be enjoyable for both of you.    I try to play a game of cards or sit down and sew or cook with her frequently.    It's one of her favorite times to sit and tell me about the past, of course with some prompting.Good luck and let me know how things are going ........HugsReiReiP.S.    7 WEEKS away from mom is too good to be true, I would be in heaven.    The most I get is an overnight stay once a month from my brother.    7 WEEKS unimaginable.    Good luck to your home and prepare yourself for the worst when you return.	post_2761594
post_2885606	May 09, 2008	418676	None	None	Thank you so much for your response. It IS nice to know that there are people out there in a similar situation.I think one of the reasons (aside from the fact that my mother drove me crazy BEFORE she moved in with us) that I am struggling, is that for the two years before this move, my husband and I lived a very isolated life on a remote nature preserve with just the two of us and a big house. Now I have a small house on a busy street and my mother is always sitting on the couch.I like some of the suggestions about what you do with your mom. I would pretty much take any help from mom except washing dishes. She couldn't wash a dish if her life depended on it (her dishes were so filthy at her house, in the cupboards, that maybe me washing her dishes really is saving her life). She rubs them between her fingers under warm running water.And YES! little food packets and dabs of take-home food, and a half a piece of toast she didn't finish, and, and, and. If she had sisters helping her collect, the way yours does, I would probably have run screaming into the woods already.Mom and I don't have much in common. We like to watch certain shows and movies on netflix together, but we run out of ones we both like. We both like to eat out, but with her fixed income and my husband being the only breadwinner at the moment, we have to be careful about going out. We both like to garden but have rather different styles and approaches, plus she can't really do much in the yard anymore so I end up doing all HER gardening as well as mine. I am an early morning person who gets up at 5, and she is a night owl who gets up at 11.And yeah, I NEVER criticize her laundry folding (she's very good at it, better than me) even though I am a critical person, because it is one of the few things she can do and I could use the help. And she has been better about corralling her papers in recent months, even though I don't think much gets thrown away.We kicked around the idea of a fridge in her room, but one of the big problems at her house was her biological red zone fridge. She never wraps anything and she rarely takes something back out of the fridge once she has abandoned it there. She also doesn't like her drinks cold, so we keep them on a shelf in the kitchen. She has several shelves that are all her. I did try to get her to store some of her snacks in her room because she is skinny and I am not, and her snacks are trouble for me (my willpower is at the store, not on the shelf), but with her tendency to leave things open, unwrapped, etc, we got ants, so the food in bedroom idea wasn't working. She has her own satellite tv in her room, because she likes to watch tv when she is going to sleep. I had hoped that she would retreat to her room for an evening maybe once a week and leave me and hubby alone in the living room, but that rarely happens, which is part of my claustrophobia. I'm planning to get a job in the fall, even though that will double my workload, because I need a way to get away from mom for extended periods during the day.And yes, from a caretaker standpoint, I do realize that 7 weeks away from mom is like manna from heaven. I am going to enjoy every single solitary microsecond of it, even though I will be doing a hard physical job.I do worry that she will make herself sick while we are gone, between eating spoiled food off dirty plates and smoking in the house when she isn't even supposed to be smoking, much less in the house. But if her health declines while we are gone, it will give me fuel for setting limitations.And yes, I expect to come back to a fridge full of rotting dabs of food, counters full of odds and ends of food, little folded pieces of paper towels everywhere, stinky bowls with puddles of dirty water in them in the sink, dirty dishes in the cupboard that mom "washed" while we were gone, and a mom going into respiratory crisis because she smoked too much when there was nobody to hide from.At least the cleaning service will reduce that. My sister is paying for it for ME, so that I come back to clean windows and floors.Again, thanks for listening and responding. Sometimes this is the only place I can come and vent when I feel like exploding.	post_2761594

I lead a very busy professional life as well, and I have to let the small things slide to whenever I can tackle them. If I didnt do that, then I would be one stressed out individual. So many people are willing to help, but you have to let them help.    I have amazing friends, and the help they    provide me has given me extra time to focus on the other things that must get accomplished.KL	post_2761594

I told her AGAIN that the only time husband and I are going to mexico is at christmas in 3 years, and it is our late honeymoon for US. How many times do I have to say this? Mom hasn't discussed Europe yet with little sister, who is waiting impatiently because now is the time to do plane reservations. One track mind. If mother would just TALK to my sister she might get off this kick of thinking I'm going to change my mind about mexico. I am NEVER going to mexico again with my mother.

post_2782139	Apr 15, 2008	477363	429779	mogus	Hi I am a Patient Care Tech in Greenville, SC I work for an agency called Community Long Term Care. This program would be great for your mother. I would call your local NC Department of health and human service to see if they have a simular program. The service that I provide is helping my clients with adult daily living such as bathing, cleaning, cooking, and just being there friend, etc... This program also provides frozen meals delivered every week.. it's not meals on wheels... this food is actually pretty good, also they provide breifs, wipes, other services to help the family such as pest control, heating and air, they even help pay some bills when times are hard. I have one client who's AC broke and the agency got him an AC unit. Moreover, I have another client that had a leaky roof and it was causing damage to the home. The agency pain to have the roof fixed. So, call DHHS to see if your mom can get a service like this. But she does need insurance to pay for it. The agency I work for takes medicade. I commend you and your family for taking care of your mother... it is not an easy job. This program in SC is designed to keep people living at home or with family as long as possible. I have worked at a lot of nursing homes here in SC and I really don't have much good to say about them.Best of wishes	post_2746679
post_2572455	Feb 27, 2008	144586	None	None	There seems to be a bias against the elderly. They simply aren't treated as "normal" human beings. If someone were thirty and had similar symptoms you can be a physician would be on top of things. It's as if older people simply have to bear burdens.    This was true in hospitals decades ago and I thought things would get better, but they have not. I don't think 84 is that old. I have a semi-retired physician friend who is his late seventies, sharp as a tack, and has some trouble finding hospital assignments. One would think an older physician would be just the whipped cream on the cake for a nursing home, but there is age bias in many areas. You asked the question: "What gives here?" I can't answer that, however the situation you have appears to be the norm, rather than the exception.	post_2571276

If you get games purchase of the controller unit, plus a gamecard helps tremendously. Flight Simulator, with the control station (stick and rudder and guns) and a game card can be tremendously interesting. They also have a train simulator, and various routes to pilot your train, and model railroad systems on the computer. The interactive monster fighting games and the army and other military games can consume hours. You can also play chess and checkers on the internet with players from all over the world at any time of day or night.	post_2571276
post_2761604	Apr 10, 2008	465121	None	Pienky	Here's a suggestion that helped me with my mom when my dad died.    She had the same problem of depression after his death.    She would say over and over again, I just miss talking to your father.    He was always such a good listener.    One day, I decided to buy a helium balloon that says I LOVE YOU.    I told her to hold, love, hug, talk, and kiss the balloon as if it were my father.    After a few minutes of tears, I said when you're ready lets now send it to dad in heaven.    We watched that balloon for the longest time until we could see it no more.    I promised to buy her a balloon when ever she needed to talk to my father.    At first, it was a dozen balloons at least daily, but this has now dwindled to one balloon a week.    This worked better than the depression meds from the docs.Good luckReirei	post_2571276
post_2767344	Apr 11, 2008	363852	None	All of you	My dad is doing better. I make contact with him every day and visit at least once a week.We talk about the past, the present and the future. He has days that he is sad, but he is getting better. Two weeks ago, be almost lost his companion of 13 years to severe pancreatitis; his minipoodle. I think the relief of having "Skitch" return to good health has helped significantly because it was something very positive that happened, when it could have been another devastating loss. Life does work in miraculous ways. When we consider that life is full of challenges but recognize that we have so much to be thankful for...well, it gives solid perspective. I have relearned to get out there, take life by the horns, take one step at a time and live. I am 60 and have lots of life to live yet. But then, don't we all?	post_2571276
post_2767388	Apr 11, 2008	363852	None	To you all	Thank you for all of your feedback. I will suggest to my dad, the flight simulator as he was a pilot in WW2.He is planning to take painting classes. He is taking good care of himself by walking as often as he can, cooking good meals for himself and setting small goals for himself. Yes, he is sad at times, but he doesn't give in. He amazes me and has inspired me to try to develop his type of strength and resilience. He has the quiet strength of a book hero and I am so glad that I have had a chance to really get to know him as a person, not just a parent. He once survived as a prisoner of war; he is now surviving this. Do you have heroes in your lives?	post_2571276
post_2555747	Feb 24, 2008	144586	None	None	I am by no means an expert in wheelchairs, but this is my two cents worth. The government and insurance programs often provide a single wheelchair with a large set of rear wheels and a small set of front wheels and hard plastic tires. This is totally inadequate. Wheelchairs come in two basic types. (1) Those that have for small wheels (2) Those that have a big wheel in the back and small wheels in the front. Within these types there are three varieties of tire. (a) totally pneumatic (b) resilient elastomeric (c) hard plastic. For outdoors the totally pneumatic are best, but they are similar to bicycle tires and get flats. I choose the middle ground. The resilient elastomeric. These have a sponge-like interior that absorb the bumps. The difference in ride between these and the hard plastic wheels is significant. Two wheel chairs are required. The small four-wheeled chair is used for transfer around inside the house. From the bed to the chair, for example. The one with the large wheels for outdoors. As far as accessories you need a back-pack. You also need an inflatable cushion plus a foam cushion plus a soft blanket. The foam cushion goes down first. Then the blow-up-pneumatic. Then the blanket. On top of that sits the patient. You have noi idea how uncomfortable little bumps can be for little people.    For the interior four-wheeled chair I cut off the seat-belt. I have a rule that she is NEVER EVER to be left alone in this wheelchair, thus there is no need for a seatbelt. She eats in this chair, however an aide or myself are with her at this time. The arguement is the seat-belt is for "safety", however it makes my little one VERY upset and she claws at it infrustration. I'd rather have her happy and contented. The best wheelchairs can be disassembled. You should know, if custom ordering they come in numerous sizes. The biggest problem is when you are outside the patient's feet can get caught either in front of the steps or fall between the foot-rests. You need to purchase a pair of two-inch wide velcro belts at about a buck each. When the wheelchair is set up place these BEHIND the legs. If you find the feet slip out in front get a piece of one quarter inch plywood and make an extension for the foot-rests. Dimensions are not critical.    Cover this in soft cloth. The extension will be attached to the two foot-rests by two drilled holes, a short bolt and a wing-nut on the bottom. Such an extension will prevent foot injury. Without such an extension you have to constantly check as you push along for the position of the patient's feet. In the back bag, whever we go out I have a thermos with a beverage, a number of two and half ounce disposeable cups, and a ripe banana.	post_2555685
post_2629925	Mar 11, 2008	389974	None	None	There is a lot that goes into selecting a wheelchair.Some important considerations are already hinted at in your post: where will the wheelchair be used? For how many hours a day will the person have to be in it? How will they transfer out of it?If you need to take the person in a vehicle, think about the kinds of anchors and relative ease of getting it in and out. Wheelchairs differ considerably in their maneuver and now well they position.Not least, there are issues relating to how comfortably a human can sit in the chair. Many people need additional support and will lean or slip. Pillows help, but they are not the complete answer, having air cushions, or even for some people a custom fitted seat, may be a requirement.	post_2555685
post_2613778	Mar 07, 2008	144586	None	None	My little 103 year old sweety-pie has a hospital bed, but she doesn't spend all her time in it. When she is in bed she loves to have her hand held. One of the things I did was to get a brand new superstuffed chair that is beside the front of her bed. It is far foward enough that she can get into bed easily without moving the chair. When she is in bed, the aide or I can sit comfortably in the chair, and I can cuddle her with my arm or hold her hair while sitting comfortably.    If she snoozes I can continue to cuddle her or hold her hand while I watch a little television or take a snooze myself.    There are two comfortable "aide" chairs in the room. My sweety-pie has her own "television chair" in which she sits and watches TV. Right next to her TV chair is another comfortable "caregiver chair". When I (or an aide) sit in this chair I can comfortably put my arm around sweety-pie and not get a cramp.    I mention this because I have visited many homes where the elderly are cared for and it is an exception for the chairs to be positioned in this manner. The aides chair is generally on the other side of the room or several feet away. My opinion is that it is essential for the caretakers chair to be within a comfortable hands reach of the patient. And the caretakers chair(s) should be very comfortable. Not filding chairs. Not kitchen chairs. Chairs with high backs that you can relax your neck on.	post_2613750
post_2606497	Mar 06, 2008	144586	None	None	My little 103 year old has complex swallowing difficulties. The difference between life and death is feeding technique. I have fired 33 aides who have not followed instruictions in this regard. In the case of my 103 year old we have a number of co-factors, ranging from stroke to hypothyroidism to muscular atrophy. One of her chief problems stems from a failure of her lower esophageal sphincter to relax. A patient with this syndrome will typically swallow two ounces of fluid (or two teaspoons of food) normally. At that point they "wave off further food." Many aides and nursing staff will have a limited amount of time to assist in feeding. This is the cue for them to "force-feed". Some facilities teach the aides to force-feed. I worked in such a facility. Force-feeding is always wrong. Always. Force-feeding can cause death. Death can occure in two ways. The passageway to the stomach is interupted by the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). For many reasons in the elderly this mucular ring will contact, but not always relax. Since it will not relax the food/liquid blocks up. A co-factor in the elderly is a poor gag" reflex. Thus force-feeding causes fluid/food to enter the trachea. If food/fluid enters the trachea aspiration pneumonia can result, precipitating a lengthy expensive hospital stay. However there is a greater danger. That danger is larangospasm. Many drowning victims are found to have no water in the lung when autopsied. This is due to larangospasm when water enters the trachea. These spasms can completely block the airway. An aide fed my sweety-pie some liquid. She then waved off further liquid. The aide insisted on encouaging her to open her mouth and gave her more liquid. This fluid entered the trachea which went into spasm, she turned blue, and to maintain an airway I had to administer mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. These spasms will release themselves in a short period of time. If you have sublingual nitroglycerine on hand this will also release the spasm. As a caregiver, from time to time you may have an aide to assist, or be involved in a nursing home situation with a loved-one. There is a tendency to submit to "authority", especially when the aide/nurse/caregiver/physician has a "credential" and assurs you :they have years of experience". I have never encountered a situation where force-feeding is indicated. In the case of little sweet-heart feeding sometimes takes two hours. Feeding cannot be hurried. There are treartments for this disorder which are beyond the scope of this post. They include muscle relaxants, particuliarly calcium-channel blockers, emergency nitrates, botux injections and various surgical procedures. Be aware these swallowing difficulties can develop slowly over a period of time. Rejection of nutrient or liquid does not necessarily mean the patient "does not want to eat". They may be protecting themselves from asphyxia due to larangospasm.	post_2606333
post_2609850	Mar 06, 2008	432073	None	None	Thanks for that information.    There is a resident at the facility that I work with who will take two small bites and wave off the rest like you say.    I thought she just wasn't hungry, which seems silly because that is a ridiculously small amount of food to eat.    From now on I will take more time feeding her.	post_2606333
post_2611241	Mar 07, 2008	144586	None	None	One of the big problems with larayngospasm in the elderly is that the muscles don't readily release. In a young person who while swimming inhales a splash of water in the trachea there may be a momentary spasm. In the elderly (particularly the stroke patient), for a number of reasons, the muscles contract but to NOT readily release.    They can take a LONG time to release. There are complex reasons for this, some known and some unknown. Hypothyroidism can cause this condition, for example. If there is choking you should remain with the patient holding them and providing reassurance.    The airway must be kept clear. I recommend keeping the patient in the upright position to prevent the fluid/food from backing up. These episodes can be very scarey. The swallowing is often circardian in nature. That is to say normal swallowing can take place late at night while be non-existant in the morning. Often I can get eight ounces of fluid into my 103 year old after 11 P.M. In any event, a bit of food/water/fluid in the trachea can cause a spasm, changing a swallowing problem into an airway oclusion problem. Generally this situation will resolve itself in time, but it can take a while. The drill is to immediately stop feeding and place your hand on the back and attempt to have the patient spit out food. A finger may be inserted into the mouth, but NOT TOO DEEPLY to sweep food out. You do not want to cause a "gag" reflex. You have to be prepared to provide mouth to mouth rescuscitation or have an AMBU bag handy. This not a cardiac arrest situation, so chest compressions will not be neccesary. You may have to provide assisted breathing to the patient for three to fifteen minutes. If the spasm does not relax, the drill is sublingual nitroglycerine, which will relax the spasm. Of course nitroglycerine will also lower the blood pressure. If nitroglycerine is used do not lie the patient flat, but if you want to lie them down the back should be up at a thirty degree angle. The reason is that the nirtoglycerine will also relax the lower esophageal sphincter and if you lie them FLAT, there may be an upward flow of acid from the stomach, which will precipitate another spasm.    The effects of the nitroglycerine will wear off after from 15 minutes to a hour. You generally won't need endotracheal intubation. Unfortunately this is often the first protocol used by hospital personnel. Probably you won't need transport to a hospital. There is a window of opportunity that must be utilized on-the-spot. The "two-small-bites-and-then-refuses-food" syndrome is definitive for a dysfunctional lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The muscles of the sphincter are not relaxing. Unfortunately, most physicians do not pay attention to this. There are surgical and non-surgical treatments. Muscle-relaxants, particuliar particuliar calcium channel blockers, can sometimes solve the problem. Botox injections have also proved helpful. The problem is compounded because in many elderly patients the conventional diagnospital procedures cannot be used (i.e. - a barium swallow). Liquids seem to pass more easily without precipitating contraction. With my 103 year old, I keep her on an all liquid diet until her daily caloric and hydration needs are satisfied. Only then do I take a chance with a more substantial food, such as yogurt or applesauce. This degradation in her swallowing has been of recent onset. Four months ago she was eating regular meals of very soft foods. I have the aides perform a "swallow evaluation" before any feeding. Most importantly when she is too sleepy feeding is probibited. She will often open her mouth, if encouraged, but that is not enough. She must hold the spoon or cup and feed herself. She will never do this if it will compromise her airway. Force feeding can be life-threatening. The general non-surgical, non-medicinal approach to this problem is simply to take your time with the feeding, and recognize that in the dehydrated/malnourished patient, a "wave-off" and refusal to swallow, does not mean "Don't give me food". It means "Wait a while and give me food later". In the case of my aides I require a meticulous log of feeding times. If you see the feeding takes only fifteen minutes you know it has been an inadequate feeding session. One of the changes I would make if I were running a nursing home is to "split" the feeding sessions, pairing patients with similar problems. Thus an aide/nurse could spent ten minutes feeding one patient, permit the LES to real while feeding a second patient, and then return to the first patient. Going back and forth several times between patients will optimize use of time while decreasing the probability of a fatal complication.	post_2606333
post_2552525	Feb 23, 2008	144586	None	None	I am still learning about caring for the super elderly, and unfortunately have a long ways to go. I fired 33 aides hired to assist in the care of my 103 year old sweety-pie untilI hired two with no experience but intelligence and compassion and trained them myself. One of the big problems is to insure proper nutrition and I have found there is only "one way to skin the racoon". Not two ways. Not three ways. ONE way. I have them keep a permanently bound book with no erasures allowed that contains a daily record of all activities from dawn until dusk with everything noted in national guard time. Hydration is kept track of by using only two and a half ounce cups ONCE. After being used they are stacked on the table. Adding the cups at the end of the day provides a precise measure of daily hydration. Getting to calories. The aides must make note of every single calorie taken in. Just like in the second grade insist they "show their work". One banana rquals 100 calories. One piece of chocolate is 15 calories. One organic egg equals 75 calories. I prepared a long printed table of caloric equivelants. The basal metabilism for my sweety-pie is 980 calories a day. Search on the net tofindout the appropriate number for your loved one. If she takes in less than 980 calories she loses weight. Every single day I get a calorie report. The goal is to insure that she exceeds 980 calories every single day, without exception.    That means if 2300 HRS (national Guard Time) arrives and she has not met that goal we feed until she does. Because of a disturbance in the circadian rhythym of the elderly they often feed well between 11P.M and 2 A.M. (2300 HRS-0200 HRS). Heavens to mergetroid! Does that mean the poor aide has to stay up?    Well...sometimes.    You feed when the patient wants to eat. Not when it is convenient for the aides.    As the saying states: "that's how it goes moving west". The one thing to be aware of when you ask: "How is the eating going?", is NOT to be satisfied with vague comments such as"she's eating well". Or: "she had a fair appetite this morning".    Unacceptable. You require a PRECISE daily calorie count. Do    not pass go. Do not collect two hundred dollars. Of course you have to keep track of nutrition also, which is more than calories. Protein and vitamins are necessary. But that daily calorie count will mean the difference between life and death.	post_2552476
post_2553483	Feb 24, 2008	144586	None	None	This evening I cuddled my 103 year old sweetie pie until midnight. She was dressed to the nines, as she is every single day. No lolling around in Pajamas. Her nails are done. She picked the color. Her hair is combed. She is well groomed. Clothing is spotless. She is wearing a pink sweater and a dark red dress. White cotton socks. And she likes those little flexible plastic shoes! In precious pink! There is no unpleasant smell or odor in the room. There never ever is. I reviewed everything she ate and drank with the aide and we tallied up 1520 calories of intake for the day! And 28 ounces of liquid. Hooray!    For the past thirty days we have exceeded 980 calories by 200-300 calories every single day. Roughly speaking 3800 excess calories reflects itself in weight gain of a pound. Sweet-pie also has swallowing difficulties and a swallow evaluation several times a day is in order. Force feeding is prohibited under any circumstances. Force feeding in the elderly, especially those with post-stroke problems usually results in aspiration of the food into the trachea and "aspiration pneumonia". Unfortunately "force feeding" is apparently taught to many aides in their certification courses and SOP in many nursing homes. When I left at midnight the aide wrote the days caloric tally in the "logbook". I inspect the logbook carefully every single day. As far as beverages go, I fololow the "four flavor rule". At every meal there are four different flavors of beverage, all served in small two and a half ounce cups. Sweety-pie can reach for and hold a small cup herself.    Bring the cup to her lips and return it to the table. Something she could not do three yedars ago. And she is very proud of her accomplishment! And I get agita (Italian Heartburn) when I see the aides try to take the cup from her tiny hand and "help her"! The rule is: If the patient can do something by themselves, they should be encouraged to do so. The meals are opportunities for physical therapy and rehabilitaion. Reaching for a cup constitutes physical rehabilitation. And the meals take a very long time. The little one can sometimes only swallow a single spoonful every ten minutes. And when I left her tonight she said: "I'm so happy!"    And she put her tiny hand to her mouth and blew me a kiss good-bye.	post_2552476

post_2558633	Feb 25, 2008	144586	None	None	One of the issues I faced with caregiving was "keeping on top of things". The initial aides    treated me like a mushroom. That is, they kept me in the dark and fed me bull___. There was "na na" and "Sha-Sha", and "Sweetpea". Oh, and there was a girl allegedly named "bling-bling".    All with streetnames. And gussied up falsified certificates that made them aides. Falsified? Yup. The norm in my area. Whenever I provided "constructive criticism" I got either of two replies (a) "I know that" or (b) "I've been doing this for years." Obtaining information about my sweet little camper became a task best suited to a CIA interogator at Guantanamo. I obtained a closed circuit television camera (just to view a small area of the room) and they complained hard and rigorously, and I unfortunately caved. Then there was the "chain of command issue". They reported to Nancy Nurse, who carried band-aides in her purse. Some said she was slow, some said she was fast, but all agreed Nancy was a pain-in-the-____. In an attempt to "get a handle on things".    I fired "bling-bling" after showing up and finding sweety-pie tied to the bed in her own feces, and the aide missing for    four hours. Of course they didn't expect me to show up at six A.M. on a sunday. This was a "chain-of command" issue. I solved it by firing four nurses in succession and them simply ending nursing visits. The straw that broke the camal's back was to show up one morning and find the house deserted. The visiting nurse arrived and decided to go out for breakfast with the aide. They left my sweety-pie belted into her wheelchair. She was crying and trying to undo-the seat-belt when I arrived. Not to be undone, the nurse and aide locked themselves out and didn't have the telephone number to the home. Since the home is huge and the bell doesn't work I didn't hear them banging. It wasn't until the fire department arrived that I discovered where the missing persons had been. Every day I ausculate sweety-pies lung fields anterior and posterior, four quadrants, check blood pressure and dorsalis pedis pulse, and rely on the aides to keep track of the private parts. And I have a fingernail oxygen sensor to keep track of P02. All data recorded daily.    In any event I then instituted a daily logbook system. The log is a children's permanently bound marble-cover school notebook. Every single day the lopg is kept. There are no erasures allowed. If a mistake is made a single line is drawn through the entry. The log reflects every visitor in and out of the room. With a printed name. The times meals start and finish. All phone calls. The time in bed and time in the chair. An exact menu of every meal (I make the meals anyway). Every bowel movement is documented with a comment as to the consistency. Did she strain? Were the stools hard or soft?    Urine color is noted each day. A morning and evening comment is made regarding (1) alertness (2) mobility (3) Is the little camper in any pain or discomfort (4) Any physical problems such as a sore or a rash or a cut (5) happiness (was she sad or bubbly?). At the beginning the aides refused to keep a calorie and hydration count. There were a hundred interesting excuses.    After firing thirty three aides they began to catch on. Every day I expect a precise hydration tally. She is served exclusively in little two ounce or two and a half ounce cups. The cups are stacked and tallied at the end of the day.    And a precise calorie count. Not what was served, but what was actually eaten. And I want the "work shown" just like in the second grade. One square of chocolate equals 15 calories. Put it down. One banana is 100 calories. I want "one banana - 100 calories 1215 HRS (national guard time)" logged in. Etc., etc. And the log is inspected by me every single day without exception. Inspection is VERY critical. And when one book is completed they are stored neatly. Thus I have a    precise daily record of my sweety-pies activities for the last three years. And there are notes on foods she likes and foods she dislikes. Of course the book initially contained information on every word she spoke. For months she didn't say a word. She had a stroke and could not talk for almost a year. I took her outside in a wheelchair every single day for four or five hours (weather permitting). I wanted her to experience life. To participate in the on-going process. I took her to fancy stores. To concerts. And for hours took her along the pathways of a beautiful park. And mostly to watch little children play. Did the nurses complain! ("She's a hundred years old - you're going to kill her!" and there was the famous quote "She's a hundred years old. She can't possibly benefit from visual stimulation") Now sweety-pie can talk a bit, feed herself, and we no longer log such things. The aide is not permitted to leave the premises without permission and having a replacement to stay in the room and all time out of the house is logged. They are paid for this time. At the end of every day we review the log and try to set goals for the week. We review the need for supplies and my sweety-pies appetite. The log gives the aides something meaninful to do. And I made clear    falsification of a log entry is a dismissable offense. On the last page of the log are emergency telephone numbers and instructions and in the back of the book is an envelope containing insurance cards. I suppose you could use a computer log, but my aides are not internet conscious. A sinple dollar children's school book seems to work well enough.	post_2558368
post_2570869	Feb 27, 2008	144586	None	None	I'm not a big fan of commercial nutritional supplements, such as "ensure", but I've used them ocasionally. My chief complaint is the soy content. My little 103 year old has swallowing difficulties and must eat pureed food. One of her favorites is mashed potatoes. I use organic mashed, supplemented with lots of butter, lactose-free milk, and various gravies.    I supplement every portion with 70 calories of whey protein (from a health food store) mixed with the mashed potatos. I always add supplemental whey protein.    I use a calorie chart to figure out what this provides for her. One tablespoon of butter is 100 calories. She loves butter. One quarter cup of cream of chicken gravy is about thirty calories. Turkey gravy, thirty calories. One quarter cup spaghetti sauce, seventy calories. I use a half dozen different gravies and sprinkle on a tiny bit of fresh ground pepper. The different flavored gravies provide variety to the meals. The mashed potatoes are easy to prepare and she enjoys eating them by herself. The potato sticks to the spoon, which helps with spills. She can't always hold the spoon parallel with the ground. I like the fact one can adjust the consistency of the mashed potatoes Sometimes I mix the mashed potatoes with some very finely minced ham.	post_2558368
post_2740238	Apr 04, 2008	368886	471207	Nicks_name	Hello.Can you mention the artery/arteries which are calcified?Dementia is a manifestation of dysfunction of the frontal and parietal cortex, on a broad scale. In Dementia of the Alzheimer's type, there may be a generalized atrophy of the cerebral cortex.If the artery which is calcified supplies to these two lobes, there are chances of vascular dementia. It will have to be confirmed by MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography) whether the calcified artery is blocked or patent.You have not mentioned the age of the person. There is nothing much one can really do to prevent a possible dementia, as we don't know for sure if the calcification will produce dementia. If there is a history of hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol level, or any disease of the small blood vessels, these have to be controlled in order to prevent further calcification.Regards	post_2739879

There are specific guidelines depending upon the scores.Her MMSE of 28 looks just fine. Anything above 24 is absolutely normal.Does she have significant memory problems ? Why was she taken to a neuropsychologist ?Regards	post_2408215

This is different Doctor, She is ABPN diplomate , board director with extra qualifications geriatrics.

post_2411105	Jan 25, 2008	368886	343532	valmart	Hello.What was the dose of risperidone at the first testing, and since how long was she taking it ?There are studies, and also with clinical experience, risperidone is seen to improve cognition. But again, it is dose dependent. Some patients do not tolerate the drug, and in the elderly patients, there are chances of disorientation.I am not much aware of the system. But I have gone through the websites. Ideally the tests should be done by a person certified by either or both these associations. But even if the psychologist is not certified by a particular board or association, the outcome will depend on how good he is in his work.Regards	post_2408215

post_2413664	Jan 26, 2008	368886	343532	valmart	Hello.In such a condition, the results of the test are bound to to be misleading. The person doing the test has to be trained in pre-test assessment and counseling of the patients and relatives. I think this was not done.I guess you can not repeat the test soon. There as to be a gap of 6 months before you do it again.Usually an MMSE of 28 should not prompt a further cognitive testing. Can you mention which test was done, please ?Regards	post_2408215

post_3776399	Dec 16, 2008	711913	371980	bandnmom	I have this condition.    I was born with a rather severe form of it which included part of my skull missing.    This resulted in me having to have a bone graft (taken from my ribcage), skin grafts and various operations to stretch skin which had hair on to it on to areas that had been left bald by the skin grafts.    Eventually when I was 12 years old the surgeon used skin expanders (one in each side of my skull) to expand the skin over 13 weeks (think they injected them with saline) so that when they took them out there was a mass of skin with hair to stretch over the remaining bald patch.    This covered about half of it and I am now left with a patch at the back which is covered by the fact that my hair is straight and shoulder length so unless the wind blows no one really notices it.    I had the option to have the skin expanders again but by this time I was eager to get on with my life and give hospitals a miss!    I live a full and healthy life and this condition has had no long term effects on my life apart from having being a great conversation topic in the pub when people say WHAT!!! The only thing I find difficult is making people believe it because as you have probably found there arent many of us around.

She had 2 large holes in the skull, the bigger    on the top and a smaller one in the back. She also had no skin just scar tissue covering the entire top of her head. At 18 month she went threw the skin expansion process. 2 large expanders in her head that were filled with the saline once a week for 16 weeks. Then the final surgery when they did the skull grafting and removal of the scar tissue and pulle all the expanded skin together. the surgeon did a great job and i am learning how to cover the scar lines while doing her hair. Glad all of that is in the past. As you said there are not many ACC patients out there so as far as the future goes I have so many questions that the doctors just cant answer. Kind of a learn as you go process. Dont ;like it but what choice do we have....right??? Thank you again!	post_2423020

She too went through the skin expanders then surgery at the age of 3.    Come to find out, my husband is the carrier. He has a series of small scars on his scalp AND he is missing 1 joint in all of his toes. My husbands father also has a series of scars on his head as well. When I got pregnant with my son, I went to a genetic doctor and he had said only the carrier can pass it on. My daughter will have a 50% chance of having a child afflicted with this, since my son didn't have it, he cannot pass it along. I hope this helps.	post_2423020

Myself, son and daughter all have another health problem that has lead her doctors to believe we all have a form of EDS.    I will be tested shortly to see if I do or not, but when I thought of her ACC, it made me curious.    I too wonder what the corilation is, if there is one.

His case was minor (knock wood). He had two blister-like spots that only went as far as the hair follicle, which they removed. Then the doctor sewed his skull back up. The stitches look perfect--like what you'd find on a baseball. Dr. Hopper wasn't kidding when he said this was routine; here's a 3-part article about a girl with Crouzon syndrome who he operated on in 2004: http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002090521_brennaface14m.htmlHowever, he and his staff treated our son (and us) with the utmost care and respect. Everything went so smoothly. The followup appointment is in a few days.If you decide to schedule an appointment, do it soon. We had to wait a couple months between the initial meeting and surgery.Good luck to everyone and their kids!!!	post_2423020

In most cases, these pregnancies have normal outcomes, normal babies.    The concern is that in a smaller number of cases, these findings increases the chances of some possible problems for the baby.Most likely the blood test you had was a triplescreen or quadscreen?    If it was, you should have some more information by this time next week.Also, you should ask your doctor about getting a "fetal echocardiogram" which is a detailed ultrasound between 20 and 24 weeks to look carefully at the baby's heart.Most of the time an echogenic focus doesn't mean anything bad, but an ultrasound at 19 weeks is really too early to tell much about the development of the heart quite yet.I hope your blood test gives you good results.

My nephrologist had a patient that did not even know he had NPS until he was in his fifties and had severe kidney problems.    Below is a website that will tell you everything about NPS.    It has links to more websites.    It is a dominant gene, therefore, there is a 50/50 chance of passing the disorder on to offspring.Hope this helps ya.

My family believe that my great grandfather might of had it. but he have no way of finding out. He never went to the doctor, and where he lived, there wasnt any near by.When i was born, my mom right away noticed that i didnt have thumb nails. she askes the docter what was this about, and he just replyed that they would grow back.    well im 17 turning 18 in 4 months..and im still nail-less.( in my thumbs that is )My 9th year of highschool was when we found out what was truely wrong with me. I ripped my left knee cap, and went to the hospital.    well, 2 weeks after i ripped it off i went.    I was in texas at the time visiting grand parents, and i get an x-ray there and they said that nothing was wrong. But the kicker is, that my knee was swolen the size of a large cantaloupe. I knew something was wrong, but i had to wait tell i came back to florida.It took one xray for the docter to tell me what i really did. I went to see another docter, and he looked at my thumbs, and asked if i bite my nails.    i do, and i told him that, and he looked at my thumbs and siad i have Nail patella syndrome. My mom and i looked at each other and giggled a bit. We thought he was messing around with us, but sure enough he came back with a 20+ thing on NPS.    We were both relieved and scared. Relieved that we found out after awll of these years what was wrong...but we were scared because now, we have to see what can happend to me.As people with NPS know, it can cause weal joint and ligaments, and when they tried to repair my knee, they said it was like taking a streched rubber band, to another one.    The surgery worked and then again it didnt.    They told me that most likely im going to have to get new knees when im older.    Im still waiting for my other knee to get ripped off, because i already know it will, and the year of 09, i came really close to just do that.i also found out that i have what they call, a Dislocation of the radial head, in both of my arms.    I.E.    you can bend my arm side ways in the 90 Degree angle...Because of all my joint problems and what not, im always in cronic(chronic)pain 24/7.    My mom will not take me to the docter for the pain, because she doesnt want me to get hooked on pain meds.    I did have a nasty addiction to the loratabs that they gave me after i have my knee surgery.    I lost over 50 pounds, and got very sick.    From all the pain i was in, i took them as long i was in pain. They gave me an unlimited suply of loratabs, and i took full advantage of it.    Then again, give loratabs to a 12 year old high schooler, and we all know it wont go good.As of today, im still in pain, and ive been told that im always going to be in pain. Ive learned to live with the pain, and somedays, i dont feel any, and other days, i want to find every pain killer and chew them up untell i cant feel anything.    Ive almost OD because of the pain when i was younger. My parents didnt truely know the pain that im in, and i dont think that they ever will. They dont know about me almost ODing, they seem to block out anything thats bad in my life, and just let everything thats pain related for me, slide under the rug.I have never met anyone who also was NPS where i live.     ITs a one in a 50,000 case, and then there are the familys that are born with it, and its a 50/50 chance that it will be passed on.    Im hopeing that my kids do not get this. i dont want to have them put through all of what ive been through. But hopefully docters can find a way to help people with this.	post_2708033

If your CVS comes back normal, your doctor should still be following you closely with ultrasound, and, if your pregancy continues, doing a detailed "level II" ultrasound and fetal echocardiogram to check the baby's heart between 20-24 weeks. Regardless of whether your CVS results come back normal or not, I hope your doctor refers you to a medical geneticist to discuss these findings.    Best of luck to you.	post_2605981
post_2754006	Apr 08, 2008	274927	None	Happy74	I'm sure you've gotten your test results back by now, but I just wanted to post and tell you my story. My baby had a nuchal fold of 6mm at 11 weeks. She was then diagnosed with a cystic hygroma. I had an amnio done and it came back normal. I then had a fetal echo done and that too seemed fine. The hygroma slowly reabsorbed and by 27 weeks was completely gone. On March 3rd I gave birth to my little girl and she's perfect. She has a little excess skin on the back of her neck from the hygroma, but so far nothing else. I'm taking her to get another echocardiogram done, just to be sure and to give me piece of mind. I hope your test results came back negative....and I hope my story can at the very least give you some hope. Take care.....	post_2605981
post_2778463	Apr 14, 2008	480086	None	everyone	I cried for weeks following a measurement of 6.5mm for our first son. My wife and I decided that we didnâ  t need any more tests to break our hearts. We knew we would love our baby no matter how he came into the world. Our son was born 100% healthy with no "chromosomal abnormality". Everyone should know that the Nuchal Fold test is VERY inaccurate at identifying issues in patients, and that it is being used as a screening test to push families towards expensive genetic testing in order to attempt to force insurance companies to pick up the bill as a typical expense. If/when we decide to have another child, we will refuse this test. DO NOT FREAK OUT OVER THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ALONE. It is only an indicator that needs much more accurate tests to back up any findings.    Not enough people come back onto these boards with positive stories. Let everyone know that this test alone does not sentence your child to a less than â  normalâ   life.	post_2605981
post_3091868	Jun 27, 2008	547700	None	everyone	Hi all, i cant help but be totally devastated over the results of my nuchal fold scan. i'm considered high risk, even through i'm only 27yr old. we are 13 weeks now and i just love and adore my baby. we will be going to discuss the result with our Dr on Monday. i cant help but feel so anxious and sad about this, but i need to keep strong to look after our precious gift till we hear more!	post_2605981
post_3228104	Aug 01, 2008	577543	None	My story	I went through the same thing in Feb & March 2008.    I was 18 weeks pregnant had a triple screen test and it came back that I was at high risk of carrying a baby with down syndrome. I went to a specialist to find out what I was having and to also get further testing with the triple screen results. With the ultra sound, they found a large hygroma on the back of the baby's neck, and SHE also had hydrops. I allowed them to do an amnio and it comfirmed Turner Syndrom(syndrome). I was told from that point that I would lose the baby. I was sent home and told that if she stopped moving, to get to my doctor right away, and if she continued to move for the next two weeks, they would have me back to check her heart. With that being said, I was so dissatisfied with the care I was given, I went to another doctor which gave me another untrasound, and showed the hygroma was now even larger and she was filled with fluid.    Her heart showed that she had Hypo plastic left heart syndrome, meaning the left side of her heart was smaller than the right, and I was told she was in conjestive heart failure and her heart would eventually stop.    They were surprised that she hung on for as long as she did, but I carried her till I was 22 weeks, then I had to be induced and gave birth.    She weighed 2lbs and was 11 inches long.    Almost 1/2 of her weight was fluid, and it was a very hard to have to see her in such a condition.    But we were able to spend time with her, have a proper burial and so forth, which helped some.    I'ts    still to understand why something like this had to happen.    I have a four year old daughter that I had in previous relationship, which she is fine, and I never saw this coming.    I'm not sure if the worry will ever go away, but you need to try and focus on the positives in your life and go from there day by day.    I'm now trying to get pregnant again, it hasn't happened yet, but I'm so scared something like this will happen again.    But I try and remember that god won't give you more than you can handle.    I don't know if this is true, but I sure do try to believe it.    God bless you, and I will pray for all of you out there that have been through the same thing.	post_2605981
post_3359635	Sep 03, 2008	608937	None	everyone	I am 42 and just came from my 12 week scan.    At 12 weeks and 4 days, the nuchal fold was 3.2 mm; and I was swiftly whisked in for CVS, as with my age and the NT being 3.2mm, my adjusted risk was 1:3 for Trisomy 21.    This was absolutely devastating.    But frankly I'm not sure if it could be as high as 33%.    1 in 3....sounds a bit too high.    I've been reading up and my partner and I decided that we wanted a diagnostic test in any case.    But I never expected to hear a statistic like 1 in 3.    We now wait for 4 days to get the conclusive results on whether it has a common genetic disorder.    The CVS wasn't too painful and I understand all the risks.    It was really amazing to see the fetus moving around so much and stretching his legs; I would feel very sad to get a bad result.    I guess it has to happen to someone.	post_2605981
post_3410052	Sep 15, 2008	621319	None	To Everyone	I'm 44 and after a long struggle with several rounds of IVF have become pregnant naturally. Given my age I've just had a Nuchal Fold scan and CVS done. The scan gave a result of 1 in 2 the highest and worst it can be. The nuchal translucency measured 4.3mm.    The blood flow also indicated potential problems. I now await the CVS results for which I should get some answers in the next 3 days.I know I should be resting but to be honest I'm so on edge and nervous that that is not going to happen.So i'm on the web doing more research and wanted to say that its been very comforting to read of other peoples experiences in what is a very difficult thing to come to terms with.I have to say that i agree that the accuracy of these tests does rest with the person doing them.The nuchal scan result recorded an absent nasal bone but from the scan done for the CVS the nasal bone could be seen.Also knowing your not alone makes it some how easier to bear. Good luck to everyone whose in this position.	post_2605981

post_2416945	Jan 27, 2008	400517	None	None	HelloI am sorry to hear that this has happened to you.    Unfortunately, it is a very common problem.    Trisomy 16 is the most common chromosome problem in human conception; it happens all the time.    Most of the time the woman doesn't even know she was pregnant. There is a conception, the embryo grows a while and then stops growing because of the extra chromosome. (normally there are two chromosomes, one from the egg and one from the sperm.    Trisomy, from French, means three - one too many).    Down syndrome, for example, is Trisomy 21.    Most trisomy 21 conceptions stop before the woman knows she is pregnant too.    But, some don't and result in a baby with Downs.    Here is the important point:    Trisomy 16 is the most common trisomy, it almost always results in a miscarriage - sometimes late enough that you find later in pregnancy, and it is a condition that can not result in a live baby.    It is a lethal condition.    As difficult as it is to believe, mother nature protected you from carrying this pregnancy any further - it could not live.    If you really have had three miscarriages, then seeing a Genetic Counselor is important.    Miscarriages are incredibly common - most couples that have a couple children have had at least one miscarriage that they know about. But, sometimes a cause can be identified.    Depending on your pregnancy history, they may (may) recommend testing your chromosomes, to be sure they are "balanced".    It is doubtful, especially with trisomy 16, that you have a "problem" - but the Genetic Counselor is well trained to know when further testing is warranted or not.    There are many obstetrical reasons for a miscarriage - and genetic problems is NOT at the top of the list.    The important point to remember is this:    See an expert, and realize that in the end, is is very, very likely that you and your husband can have a healthy baby.    You are not alone; miscarriages happen to lots of couples.    Lots of them.    You can get through this - and you will.	post_2390524

post_5394056	Feb 20, 2010	1218803	None	Anyone who will listen	Hi, my name is maribel, Im 32 yrs old. I have two kids 11 and 9 yrs old. I got pregnant with my son in december 09 when the results to my AFPT came back they were abnormal. A few weeks after I had to have a ultrasound which found a few soft markers. I was advised I should have a amnio, so I did and it came back T13. I was so    heartbroken to learn that my son would not survive. The doctors told me to terminate the pregnancy but I said no, that I would go through whatever but I would give my son a chance to live. On sept 22 my son was born, he was born with extra little fingers and toes but besides that he was perfect. I met him I fed him changed him and was blessed to have him even if it was only for three days. On sept 25 he passed away in my arms it was the hardest thing ever, but I know in my heart that I did the right thing and gave him the chance. A few months have passed now and even though the pain of not having my son with    me is still there I have been trying to have another baby. If there is anyone who can help me with this please do so. It took me so long to get PG with my son do you think that since Ive had these kids I will be able to have more children. I know that cannot replace my son and I am not trying to because I love him so much, but I guess until you go through something like this the you dont know how much you need the comfort of holding your child.	post_2390524
post_2661725	Mar 18, 2008	419309	None	nicomommy	The sequential blood test is only a screening tool, and will not give you a definite diagnosis either way.    (The "90%" sensitivity means that 9 out of 10 women who are carrying a baby with Trisomy 18 will have an "increased risk" test result.    It does NOT mean that 9 out of 10 women with "increased risk" will have a baby with trisomy 18.) Keep in mind that if your risk is assessed as 1 in 44, the chances are still in your favor that your baby does not have trisomy 18.    Think of it as a greater than 97% chance that your baby does NOT have trisomy 18 (and, conversely, only a 2-3% chance that baby is affected).Whether or not to pursue amnio is a very personal decision, but it is the most reliable diagnostic test for detection of trisomy in pregnancy available today.    Technically, amniocentesis can be performed at any point during the pregnancy, but it is recommended most at 16-18 weeks for diagnostic/management purposes.    Like the blood test, ultrasound can provide additional information but will not determine the presence or absence of trisomy.    Depending on the experience of the physician, the risk of miscarriage due to amniocentesis is somewhere between 1 in 200 to 1 in 400 in most centers.    There is no evidence to suggest additional risks beyond the risk of infection/miscarriage associated with amniocentesis.Has your OB referred you to a Genetic specialist? A consultation with a medical geneticist and/or genetic counselor may help you in your decision-making.Wishing you the best.~eureka	post_2660230
post_2665229	Mar 19, 2008	453959	None	Eureka	No, I am seeing a high risk specialist so I am unsure if I'll need to see a gen. coun. also? I spoke to him last night and he said I could have the amnio done tomorrow or Friday, but I said I would wait until I have an u's and then deicde. So, Monday I go for an u/s. I guess we'll see what happens and go from there. THANKS so much for the reply!!	post_2660230
post_2667399	Mar 19, 2008	419309	None	nicomommy	Some High Risk OBs are very knowledgeable about genetics -- some not -- if your doctor inspires your confidence and is able to answer all your questions, you may not need to consult further.I hope your ultrasound goes well on Monday -- the sonographers should do a thorough job, especially in looking at fetal movement -- especially hand movements (some trisomy 18 babies have what is known as "clenched fists") -- and they should be looking closely at the cerebral (head/brain) area.If you decide to do amniocentesis, you might want to ask your doctor about availability of a "preliminary" test called "FISH" (flourescence in-situ hybridization), which might give you some information within 24-72 hours, since sometimes amniocentesis results can take as long as 2 weeks or more.I hope you get good news from this point forward!	post_2660230
post_2700413	Mar 27, 2008	453959	None	Eureka	I went to the doc on Tuesday and the u/s showed nothing wrong with the baby. No markers were seen, and it looks like I'm having a boy (unless it was the cord). The tech and doc both agreed that baby looked great and everything was normal... 4 chambers in heart, no cysts, etc. We decided not to do the amnio and doc said he felt comfortable with that. He will see me back in 2 weeks to check again and we'll go from there.	post_2660230

post_2656691	Mar 17, 2008	450473	445638	Ken300	Marfan's is a genetic anomoly.    To rule out Marfan's you will have to be seen in genetics.    The workup includes a physical examination, an echocardiogram and an opthalmologist visit.    There is a differential diagnosis that includes other connective tissue disorders and there is no genetic test for Marfan's that can be done from blood or skin.    If she has Marfan's there could be cardiac problems that she has that she doesn't have symptoms of yet.    One of the advantages to early detection is that she can limit her activities and get routine screening so the cardiac risks can be managed.	post_2623816
post_2689526	Mar 25, 2008	460355	445638	Ken300	Google, National Marfan Organtization or go to John Hopkins marfan clinic online. Look at all of there info including related disorders but you will have to google Ehler Danlos seperately as for some reason it is not listed but is also a connective tissue disorder.    There is also another disorder similar to Marfan's and Ehler Danlos which is called Loeys Dietz Syndrome.    I would recommend looking them up and their symptoms, etc.    They all have to do with weak or fragile tissue/vessels etc that make connections loose thus the problems, etc.    You can look up the genetics clinic at most hospitals and they can refer you to a genetic clinic in your area or further advise you.    Some of the physical traits for these might not show up until later but it would be good now for you to know what to look for as these are all connective tissue disorders.    If one parent has it and you can have it and might not have had it to the extreme that you realize it, then there is a 50% chance of passing it on to your child.    It can also be a rare mutation that occurs if neither parent does have it.Some of the physical traits: loose joints, bifid uvula or broad based uvula; blue sclerae; translucent or velvety skin; pectus excavatum; scoliosis; extremely long fingers/toes; wingspan greater than height; retina detachment; club feet; cleft palate, etc.    My child doesn't have cleft palate or club feet but she does have several of the other traits and did test positive for LD.    There are varying degrees of this but it would be good for you to find out so that you can help your daughter.    A LOT of DOCTORS don't know squat about these syndromes as they are somewhat rare though I believe we will hopefully be hearing more as people become aware of what to look for etc. so you need to find out for yourself and then look for doctors who either know or are interested in helping.Good luck.    I hope your daughter doesn't have these things but if she does you need to know so that you can watch and help.    Also, everyone doesn't have the same degrees of these things...so it is not the same for everyone with this.    (for some of these disorders there are physical traits and blood work that can tell you).E	post_2623816
post_3587230	Oct 28, 2008	610350	None	Ken 300	I agree with E she needs an echo or MRI of her heart to make sure her valves and aorta are all right.    Having Marfa'ns can entail having many of the traits, or just one of them.    She could be a mutant, which means her genes muated and she has the syndrome even if no one else in the family has it.    That's how my Dad got it.    3 of his kids have it.    My brother died of a torn aorta at age 16, in 1982. My sister age 40 is just fine, she's had her mitral valve replaced several times, but nothing else so far, but she does have the pigeon chest.    I, on the other hand, have had more than 15 surgeries, all Marfan related.    Anthing from retina repair, dislocated lenses, scoliosis, mitral valve replacement, pacemaker, to brain surgery, leg shortening, and 6 mo bed rest for a pregnancy.I am the call person for Dallas TX area.on the National Marfan Foundation list.    I had my first call from Fort Worth looking for a doctor familiar with Marfan's.    I'm not finding anyone.    Can anyone suggest a name or names for me to pass on to others?	post_2623816

A = marfan syndrome and a= normal... which seems to be the case if your boyfriend himself doesnt have marfan that means that he obviously got another a = normal from his mother (im guessing his mother was normal?) that would make is genotype aa = 100% normal/ non-carrier... so im sure the chances are close to zero... ofcourse this math was done off the top of my head in 5 mins... might want to go to a genetic counselor for confirmation	post_2474212
post_2822518	Apr 24, 2008	489865	411378	amy1988	ok the other person is partly correct....But Since your boyfriend's father has it, its most likely hes a carriersince you do not have this your chances are...Girl- carrier...maybeBoy- half and halfI think..because a son will inherit from you and a daughter has you get it from bothbut yeah go to a genetic counselor	post_2474212

Blood work takes a couple of weeks to come back with any results. You should visit a Dr. Moris Angulo who specailizes in PWS but is also a endocrinand a genetisist. He is the best. he is out of Long Island NY in Winthrop Pediatrics group. So, even if your son dosen't have PWS you are going to someone who could help you figure things out and if he does you are already at the best.	post_2661950
post_2675209	Mar 21, 2008	457141	454286	bens_mom	PS -    don't read ANTTHING on the internet related to PWS, most of it is outdated information. You wouldn't even know my son has anything wrong with him at all, he is growing fine, thanks to the growth hormone and is considered AGE appropriate for all skills. he just is not walking yet but that should be in a few weeks or so. So don't panic. If you need anything or have anymore questions about PWS please contact me. Until you find out remember Don't Panic it really isn't that bad, honestly.	post_2661950
post_2705144	Mar 28, 2008	454286	None	Hi Supermummy	I have been terrribly ill this past week so I am sorry I didnt reply sooner.    My son walked at 15 or 16 months also.    He didnt crawl until about 12 months and that was only Army crawling, never on his knees.    He got up on his knees later tho. The doctors never told me anything was wrong and that he would do it in his own time so I never thought anything of it.The problem with the doctor your suggesting is he is in Long Island, NY correct?    I am in Montana....LOL.    We have a genetic hospital here in the state capital so I more than likely will use them unless I find they are not up to par.    I do appreciate the referral.Is there any information on the net that is up to date?    If there is would you please direct me to it so I can be prepared for what I might be facing here.My son was six weeks premature at birth but was large for that time.    He was 5lbs 4oz.    I have no background as far as I am concerned because I was adopted.    I only have his fathers.    I , however have Immune system problems (ie: Lupus, Fibromyalgia) and suffer from Arthritis (Oseto) as well.    At age 40, I am in bad shape.     My husband is 50 and his son from his first marriage is also having immune problems.    He was diagnosed with MS when he turned 25 I believe.    So I worry about those things with my son also.Right now we are trying to get him well.    We also think he has Asthma and he has been sick for some time now.    I am taking him to Denver to a Pulmonary hospital to get these issues resolved so I can come home with a treatment plan for his doctor here in Montana. We have hardly any specialists where we live and it is so frustrating.    I am glad to know that I am not alone,Please know that I am truly sorry for your son having this) but thank you so much for responding to me.    My son is AGE appropriate also and is right on...with his cognitive development.    Other than being a bit immature emotionally he is fine.    He is very smart.    I had him in Pre School this year at Montessori here and he was put in an Early Learner class (he would not POTTY TRAIN till end of last year..I mean REFUSED and we could not get him to go no matter what we tried-can explain more later on that) and they decided he was too smart for that class.    He turned 4 n January and moved him up to a larger and older class once he did potty train.    The only real thing I am concerned about is his always telling me he is hungry all the time(its every 1/2 hour and will not stop till he gets something or gives up because he doesnt like his choices.) (sometimes i feel its boredom because he is only child) and the fact when he was younger that I had to lock the fridge because he would not stay out of it and would eat cheese all the time.    He is a very very very very very picky eater.    He smells everything that is put in front of him before he eats it.    He loved all foods till he learned how to say NO.and became stubborn.    I have an inkling some of this if not all is behavior and resolved to him being a big kid.    My husband was a big kid growing up.    But I do see some similarities to PWS.    It goes both ways.Like I said, I refuse to believe anything till the test is done.    Should I be asking them any questions before he has this test?    Should I have him tested for other things other than PWS?    Is there any genetic testing that can predict some things later on in life, since I have no background on myself.Well thank you so much for replying and if you want I would love to email back and forth with someone who knows what its all about.    If you write to me at my email ***@****, I would be more than willing to talk with you and give you my personal information.    Thanks again.	post_2661950

post_2706582	Mar 28, 2008	457141	454286	bens_mom	The best person to contact would be JanaLee Heinemann at the National Prader Willi Site. www.pwsausa.org. She can lead you in all the right directions and where to go from here. You should also have a Prader Willi Chapter located in your state that supports children and adults with PWS in Montana. They would know who the best Doctors are and where they are located closests to you that have experience with PWS.You gave me a bit of your medical backround but only less than 5% of PWS births are genetically passed down. Usually this is just a fluke. There are basically 2 ways to have a child with PWS. 1) On conception part of Chromosone 15 fell off which is called a deletion or 2) On Conception you made two MOTHER chromosone15's and kicked the father chromosone 15 out or the father didn't make a Chromosone 15 so you made and extra one this is called UPD (Uni parental Disomy). Now this is extremely important ******** Make sure when they test him for PWS they give him 2 tests one is called the FISH and the other is the Methelaytion test. Because if they just give him the FISH they are only testing him for the 1st example I gave you (The Deletion PWS). My son showed up negative for the FISH TEST but positive for the Methelaytion test which is UPD Prader Willi. So it's very important that he is tested for both because one test could be(-) and the other show up (+) but still have the syndrome.The fact that your son was premature raises question because usually PWS babies don't want to come out. You usually have to be induced and then end up having a c-section because they are breached.Also, being that your son is intellectually right on is NOT normal for children with PWS. For the most part the average IQ is 77. My son is onlyof age I believe because he was put on the Growth Hormone at 6 months of age. he started crawling at the age of 13 months most if not all PWS children DO NOT crawl due to low muscle tone. Also, the average age for walking is 3.5 years of age for these children. But once again this is all research done when these children were NOT given Growth Hormone. So if your son was doing all those things hardly delayed and not even given Growth Hormone then thats questionable.Also, as far as his behavior goes. Children with PWS need to have a VERY regamented Schedule. Does he get thrown off if he not on a set schedule, do you have one? If you don't have one I would start to see how his behavior progresses. Also, a real great tip for the eating is this. Buy a chalk board and put it in your kitchen. every night before YOU go to bed write down a menu and the times next to each meal or snack when you will be eating them,    so that way he knows he will be getting fed and when so he doesn't    keep asking. Also, keep a small box in the refrig with his name on it and fill it with healthy snacks. When it's snack time tell him to reach into his snack box and pick out one snack he can have. Children in general like this because it gives them a choice and also makes them feel like that they are in control and you can also control his calories.Also:1) Does he have thick syliva or secretions? If so, his teeth might be hard to keep clean no matter how much you brush them.2) You said that he is being tested for Asthma? Prader Willi children/adults have some breathing difficulties/Apnea    do to having low muscle tone.3) If you look at his hands, does the outside of his hand outline starting at his pinky curve out or is it flat? If you look at your hand facing the plam of your hand you will see what I mean.4) Does he have definition in his calves or are they flat/striaght up and down. No muscle tone?5)Are his ears low set?6)Does he have amazing eyes?I can go on    on..........just keep asking me questions!Also, as far as being able to predict anything later in life, if there is something wrong with a chromosone it shows when they are fetus. That's why people choose to get Amnios. For the most part most things show up in amnios. But if he has something wrong with ne of his chromosones it will show up when he gets genetically tested. As far as testing for anything else I'm not so sure. You definitly should seek out a genetisist to speak with who has experience with PWS. I will keep in touch. Keep asking as many questions as you wish. GLAD TO HELPS	post_2661950
post_2707292	Mar 28, 2008	457141	None	Bens_mom	I was reading up on some of your past write ups and some things caught my eye.My son too had strider when he was an infant but eventually grew out of it. I notice though when he is sick because having thicker secretions he is as my doctor would say, more musical than most. Having thicker secretions could quite possibly be causing post nasal drip which is making him cough. The thicker secretions going down the throat could make it extremlely uncomfortable for him. I also have another question for you. Has your son ever fully vomitted on his own? Prader Willi children usually DO NOT vomit and if they do it's serious.When reading one of your other posts I was extremely disturbed when I read that your doctor told you to just google Prader Willi Syndrome, how insensitive!!!!!! She prob. just has absolutly NO knowledge on the subject. If I were you I would def. get yourself a new doctor who is a bit more compasionate!!!!! Because if your son does have Prader Willi Syndrome most Docs that you run across will have NO experience with someone who has PWS because of how rare it is, but I will tell you that you need to find a doc who is willing to educate themselves and wiling to listen and be understanding and get you whatever it is you are going to need to raise your child.	post_2661950
post_2720993	Apr 01, 2008	454286	None	Supermummy	Yes my son has very thick secretions.    I also believe he still has apnea. When he was born he had it also....his doctor took him off the monitors at 4months and had no apnea treatment after leaving the NICU.    I think he still has it.    He snores badly and when he is sick he will be snoring then I hear like this gasp, then back to snoring.    Yes his doctor is very insensitive.    In fact she came in and threw it in my lap after she told me he had pneumonia.    When we had his xrays done she finally looked at them (because the radiologists reports say atalectasis only) and said he had pneumonia.    These doctors here I am afraid dont have the training that is needed to take care of my son.    I am so saddend by this because we are having problems with him and its going to be costly to take care of him if we have to keep going out of state.    We are in the process of getting him to Natl. Jewish in Denver for pulmonary testing done and to get to the bottom of why whenever he is off antibiotics he is sick and coughing.    He has had a terrible winter so far.    Been sick since November and I get Viral, Croup, Asthma, Pneumonia, Scarlett Fever (strep) etc etc.    Then I get these Atalectasis , Nodularity, left upper lobe, 2.9cm consolidation in right middle lobe...its driving me crazy because I cant get a definitive answer from anyone or a definitive diagnosis.    He wasnt treated with Antibiotics until February and needed them in November IMO.    We had 3 ER visits from November to December and its always Viral.    He has been on 3 rounds of AntiB's since February.    Zpak, 2 sets of Augmentin (one he finished here a few days ago) along with Pedia Pred for 24 days.    (steroids-which dont help me with his hunger at all).    Albuterol treatments every 4 hours thru the night when in flares and they had him on Flow Vent, Singulair, Inhalers,    all not doing a thing for him...the last time he did antib's and pedia pred, it took 6 days before he came down sick again with fever and mucous and COUGHING.    So I am waiting for the shoe to drop here in a few days.My son does get a little thrown off if we are not on schedule. Most days we are home and we have tv, reading time, play time and independent time (which he does not like one bit-its when I do my household stuff-he helps with that also but would rather play but gets very mad when I have to do these things. I have noticed that since we have pulled him out of his pre school he is just so irritable.    And he was like that all through the ages of 2-3.    We placed him in school at the end of age 3 and he seemed to get better when he would go there 3 days out of the week for 6 hours each day.    (its been difficult for him tho..my husband worked out of state his first 3 years of life, then moved in when he retired from his job, and we separated for 2 months due to some marital problems over the holidays-we are together again now) So he could be irritable from those issues as well.    I had him in counseling with a fun therapist a few times and she said he was as normal as kids come...his doctors are calling him emotionally immature.    IMO he is a bit.    He is also high anxiety.My son is doing fine in most areas    .Still cries very often and when someone says NO to him, also hides his face if someone corrects him for saying something he should not have or if he is corrected by someone he does not know very well (like a teacher or another parent etc)    He still wants to be a baby sometimes.    He will also fight getting dressed and things of such sort because he wants his mom to do it all the time for him so he can be a baby.    (my opinion is BEHAVIORAL)His calves are thick.    I have that also.    I mean not because they are chubby he just has short legs like me with bigger calves.    Now that could be due to his weight.    The more you tell me about this , the more I am believing he does NOT have PWS.When my son Vomits he vomits profusely.    He will projectile but it comes from coughing so hard.Most of the things you described for PWS are not happening with my son. His muscle tone is good.    He has some trouble in the legs when he has to push...lets say a bicycle pedal.The reason for my son coming early is because I ruptured.    But I ruptured on a Sunday and had no contractions for 3 days after that.    I was in the hospital 3 days before all the water drained out and was put on Antibiotics and given Betamethasone .    On Wednesday evening I finally started to contract and thats when they did the C-section. I had no pain of contractions becuase the minute he started moving and I was feeling it they took him. He stayed in the NICU for 2 weeks. No incubator.    Nothing gave those doctors any indication he had PWS.    He was a pretty normal preemie and did very well.When the doctor came in and told me about PWS, I was floored when she told me to google it etc.    She told me her partner mentioned it to her because of my son's weight and she thought he had a short stature which he does not.    He is 46inches tall and weighs 87lbs.    Most of what you said physically my son does not have.    And what do you mean by amazing eyes?    I think they are...they are beautiful blue.    A real pale blue at that.    My husband is blueish/hazel and I am brown.    I will call the pws foundation and see if my state has a chapter.    I cannot thank you enough for all your help.    I will be back in a day or so to check to see if you replied ok?    Thank you so much.    Its late and I better get some sleep.    My son has a follow up ped's check from his strep throat , Scarlett fever.    Oh get this...we went to the doc this last round on being sick and my son had a strawvberry tongue.    It looked exactly like a strawberry.    So we showed the doc and she had never seen that, so then they checked my son for a rash..and he had that sandpaper feel to his upper arms and in his upper back. You know they never told me anything about that. She called her partner in to look, they whispered something and she got us on another course of antib's...and she said she didnt know...but that he needed antib's.    So we did this round of antib's and pedia pred for 12 days now.    He is doing ok at this time. Still has some slight wheezing..going on but lungs are clear.    I hope his pulse ox comes up past 92 tomorrow.    Well anyway, I came home and googled strawberry tongue and Scarlett Fever came up (it has been going around up here for that last 3 years).    So I called her office back and it was put in his chart I called back with that..and she came in and talked to us last week and said it could have been lets test him for strep...I said after the fact he has already been on antibiotics?    NO..NO.    why make him do that if he has already been on them and he wont show it anyway?    This is our 3rd doc up here.    I hate all the peds up here so far...I am going thru them like water.    But we did do a throat culture on him to check him for staph.    No calls about his culture so I am assuming its negative.    Antib's for the last 25 days should have killed whatever is going on with him...would you assume?Ok well going now...just had to tell you that story and give you more of an idea what I am dealing wtih.    Take care.	post_2661950

It can be inherited, but it can also occur as a new condition in an otherwise unaffected family.    Your cafe-au-lait spots could be an isolated condition, but if you have concerns about it being a symptom of a genetic syndrome, you might want to seek an evaluation by a medical geneticist, and ask about available NF mutation testing if your suspicions are confirmed.	post_2697182

post_2656330	Mar 17, 2008	450473	440255	wantanswers2day	It is hard to explain the entire process by which ovum and sperm are created in this message, but the process by which you get an extra chromosome is best known through down syndrome (trisomy 21).    Ideally an ovum will carry one copy of each chromosome 1-22 and one X chromosome.    When it meets a healthy sperm with one copy of chromosome 1-22 and either one X or one Y chromosome you will have a child with 46XX or 46XY genes.    When a problem occurs in the creation of ova or sperm cells, sometimes one cell will carry 2 copies of a chromosome (or part of a chromosome) and another cell will carry none.    Sometimes, as in the case with down syndrome, this causes functional problems for the child.    Once the problem occurs and a child is born, that child has a 50/50 chance of having a child with the same chromosome abnormality.    By looking at you and your husband's genes the doctor is trying to see if your childs mutation is de novo (new) or inherited (from you or your husband).    If it is inherited (you or your husband have it) and you and your husband are normal, they will know that it is unlikely to be the cause of your child's problems and they should persue other testing options.    If it is de novo then it is worth studying further.    From what you've said, it does not seem that this particular duplication has been studied much because they did not give you a diesase name or common symptoms.    As far as whether this is a "rabbit hole" it depends on how you look at it.    Genetics doesn't currently offer many treatments, especially not for newly identified conditions.    It may tell you what to expect down the line and help you to prevent life threatening problems through early detection, but it's not going to fix your problem today.    It is also a field where there is a lot of research happening, and there is hope for treatments in the future, so by spending your time today figuring out the problem and participating in research studies in the future, you may offer a cure in 10, 20, 50 years.    As for whether it is good or bad - I guess that is also how you look at it.    It may offer answers for you, guidance for what to monitor for down the line and probability for your and your son's possible future children, but ultimately I don't think it changes anything.    You will still have to treat the symptoms even if you know what caused them.	post_2630103
post_2658304	Mar 17, 2008	440255	None	None	Thank you for your reply.    THe nurse said that particular area had no locus or loci...(im assuming no diagram of genes on that particular area.)    She assured me I wouldn't find any info on that particular location (I tried to get the "address" of the mutation from her).    I forgot to mention my husband and I have two older children (6 and 3) together with no health problems at all.    We are getting the tests simply because we want to know if they feel the need to continue the road of diagnosis with him.    We know if they determine that this chromosome thing is the cause of his problems, then they wouldn't know anything about it or what to tell us to expect.	post_2630103
post_2655958	Mar 17, 2008	450473	448903	vansh	It certainly sounds like the problem is autosomal dominant because of the strong family history in both males and females, but in order to know for sure we would have to know the actual diagnosis.    If the problem is autosomal dominant, your child would have a 50% chance of inheriting the condition.    You should speak with a genetic counselor before conception because there might be new treatments available for the condition.    There also might be genetic screenings such as amniocentesis or chorionic villae sampling (CVS) that would allow you to prepare ahead for the condition should your child be affected or terminate the pregnancy if you choose.    It may even be a condition that can be detected through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) so you could choose the unaffected embryos before beginning the pregnancy.    No matter how you feel about the treatments available, it is something you should talk about with your fiancee before you get married.    This is something she's lived with her whole life and she has probably formed a strong opinion about the options already.	post_2637707

With your pregnancy outcomes, your folic acid supplementation should be undertaken for 3 MONTHS prior to conception (usually the recommended dose is 4mg/day for at least 3 months).    Also, you might ask your doctor about the availability of 1st trimester ultrasound in the event of a future pregnancy.As for your husband's chromosome inversion:    some inversions can contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes, but some chromosome 9 variations are considered 'normal.'    I would strongly recommend that you seek out a Genetic specialist to discuss your husband's findings.    (They are also the right people to ask about your husband's epilepsy and medications.)The fact that your first born is normal (presuming it's with the same partner) is proof that you can have a normal pregnancy.    Whether you choose to try again is a very personal decision.    I hope you seek out (and find) good medical advice in that regard.	post_2621847
post_2567492	Feb 26, 2008	433102	None	evtyhing4reason	My heart goes out to you. I was told 2 weeks ago that my baby may have Trisomy 13 as well. The amnio came back negative last week, but we're still faced with the issue of a clenched/flexed right wrist/hand. No one can tell us if it's indicative of something genetic or neurological - or if it's an isolated event that could be fixed with physical therapy or surgery - or if he's actually fine. So we're in the 2nd/3rd opinion stages at this point.Perhaps you've already received the information you're looking for, but both the "fluke" type and inherited type exist for Trisimoy 13. From the little I know, the inherited type is known as a translocation, which is when pieces of chromosomes break off and reattach elsewhere.There are also 2 "fluke" types - one where the extra chromosome affects all cells and one where some cells are normal, others abnormal. This latter type is also known as "mosaicism". When I was first tested, they did a rapid test (known as FISH) that provided preliminary results in 2-3 days. That came out negative for Trisomy 13, but can't provide anything definitive for the mosaicism type. We had to wait for the amnio, where they can test the baby's skin cells that have sloughed off and are floating around in the amnio fluid.My doctor and genetics counselor said that most of the time it's a fluke and a couple can go on to have perfectly heatlhy children.I wish you the very best!!	post_2491476
post_2573917	Feb 28, 2008	414635	433102	mommyboo	Thanks for the info and for sharing your story. The amnio came back that it was trisomy 13 and we opted to interupt the preganacy(pregnancy)and i delivered 2 weeks ago at 19 weeks. My baby had many many very severe defects so are only other option was to wait for the baby to die which could've taken 2 weeks or 2 months but would never have made it to termWe are still waiting for the full results of the amnio to tell us it it was the inheirted type or not. I am adopted and have always feared that i wouldn't be able to have children due to something in my genetic so I wn't be able to rest until i get the final results back.I actually ended up back in the hospital this week with a uterine infection which they thought i would have a d&c for but luckily didn't have to and am out after 2 days but now i have to go back to the hospital every 8 hours for 5 more days, but it's better then being stuck on the materinty floor.	post_2491476

post_2589097	Mar 02, 2008	419309	None	evthing4	Sorry to hear about your loss. Keep strong.Mommyboo gives good info!    I work for an OB/geneticist, and I can tell you:    plenty of women have healthy pregnancies and babies AFTER a pregnancy with Trisomy 13.Trisomy 13 is a genetic problem, but usually it's not 'inherited'.    Most of the time it is a 'fluke', a chromosomal mutation that is nothing a parent did nor contributed to. There is a minority of cases where it is 'inherited', when a parent has a slight change in their chromosomes (translocation) that can cause Trisomy 13 in pregnancy.    A simple blood test called 'peripheral blood karyotype' can tell you whether your not you have a translocation.    And even if you did, it doesn't mean you can't have normal healthy babies!You might want to seek the advice of a genetic counselor or medical geneticist if your OB cannot answer all your questions.    Have faith!	post_2491476

When we go back to the specialist he will set up appointments for gentic counseling and wants me to come to a preconception clinic. I have already decided that I will be having my next baby at that hospital as they specialize in women's care rather then my local hospital. It's been rough, especially with the set back of the infection...I'm totally exhausted from going to the hospital 3 times a day..but tonight is my last time, then to my OB/GYN on friday and once i get a clean bill of health we're booking a trip to the domincan for some R&R!	post_2491476

post_2624534	Mar 10, 2008	414635	None	None	Just found out today that it was just a FLUKE!!!!!and the only precautions we have to take with our next pregnancy is stuff i want done anyways---early bloodwork (my Dr hadn't done ANY not 1 bloodtest and i waa 17weeks the last time i say her) and i get to go for an ultra-high-tec ultrasound at 12 weeks (normally you don't get an u/s here until you are 20 weeks). I'm sooooo happy right now	post_2491476
post_2626771	Mar 10, 2008	419309	None	evthing4	So pleased you got good news!    I'm guessing from your post that you and your husband have normal blood karyotypes?!?    (Although, I have to say that I'm a bit concerned that you were in your 2nd trimester before ANY bloodwork was done?...)As for the 'ultra-high-tec' ultrasound... screening can be done as early as 11 weeks (often called first-trimester-screening or nuchal translucency screening), but you might also want to read up on an option called 'chorionic villus sampling' (CVS for short), which can detect chromosomal abnormalities as early as 10-1/2 weeks.    You should ask your doctor about both these options before your next pregnancy, so that you will be well-prepared!	post_2491476

post_2587778	Mar 02, 2008	436692	432915	sajmellon	I'm so sorry for your loss, and wish your two sisters going through treatment now strength and courage.Last May, at 41 years old, I was diagnosed with DCIS (non-invasive, stage 0 breast cancer).    I chose a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction instead of lumpectomy and radiation.    I wanted the most aggressive treatment since I'm a mom to 2 young children, one with special needs.    I did not have a history of breast cancer in my family; however, I was offered the genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes -- mutations that have been associated with breast and ovarian cancer.    My oncologist, not surgeon, ordered the tests.    We also met with the genetic counselor at my oncologists office who took a family health history, and calculated my risk for other cancers.    Fortunately, my test results came back negative for the gene mutations.    At the cancer center here in Denver, I believe it is standard to offer the genetic testing to women with breast cancer and recommend removal of ovaries/hysterectomy if it's positive.    That happened to a friend of mine.    She had decided on lumpectomy, but then had the genetic testing which showed she was a carrier.    She then decided on mastectomy and hysterectomy.I remember that my oncologist said that now that I've had a breast cancer that my sister, mother and daughter have a 50% higher risk of getting one as well.The only downfall I can see for genetic testing is the cost.    It's very expensive, but insurance usually picks up the cost.    Here's the lab that did my testing... Myriad Labs in UT http://www.myriad.com/products/bracanalysis.php    Their website should have more information for you.I suggest that your sister interested in removing her ovaries have the test.    Then if she's positive, it's a case for you and your other sisters to get tested.    Many women that have the gene mutations -- without breast cancer -- opt for preventative mastectomy.    At the very least, you have a strong history in your family and could make the case for annual MRIs with your mammograms.    MRIs have been found to be better at finding early cancers in high risk women.Best of luck to you and your family.    Please contact me if you have any other questions.Jeanne	post_2577432
post_2604021	Mar 05, 2008	432915	None	Jeanne	Thanks for the insight! It will be a long road ahead. The physicians in my area are aggressive, it is unfortunate that the physicians in my sisters area are not. The three of us need to get our physicians to schedule an MRI for us. Genetic testing will cost over $3000-which in my opinion is too costly! Isn't there aide from the cancer society or something? One would think the insurance companies would rather pay for preventative maint. rather than the whole cancer treatment stuff. Thanks for the support!	post_2577432

("intra" = inside the uterus)    It just means that it is IN the uterus--where it should be (as opposed to a tubal pregnancy, which happens in the fallopian tubes, or an extrauterine pregnancy, which happens outside the uterus -- and yes, it does happen, oddly enough). As to the other questions:    sex usually is the cause of intrauterine pregnancy, but in this day and age, it could be via IVF, or IUI, or ICSI or any other number of fertility treatments; the baby usually grows (we hope normally) for a period of 36-40 weeks and is then delivered (or C-sectioned)... and we hope the baby won't need to be fixed ;) (but, about 3-5% of normal intrauterine pregnancies need medical intervention on baby's part) -- and mental retardation or down syndrome is usually a low risk if mother is under age 35.	post_2547477
post_2588991	Mar 02, 2008	419309	385398	Chyna26	Hi chyna, so so sorry about your prior losses.    I sure hope this pregnancy has a good outcome for you.    Echogenic foci is oftentimes a 'normal variant'... that is, it's a shiny spot on the baby's heart that may be absolutely benign.    There are some physicians that feel there is an increased incidence of "echogenic foci" when babies have down syndrome or heart defects, but the link is weak (<5%).    Your doctor should be recommending another ultrasound between 22-24weeks called fetal echocardiogram to check to make sure that the baby doesn't have a structural heart defect, as well as offering you the option to do an amniocentesis if you feel you need to know if the baby has a severe birth defect like Down Syndrome.    REMEMBER: The chances that your baby does NOT have DS or a heart defect are much greater than it being affected by these diseases because they saw the echogenic foci.    Good luck, and god bless.	post_2350531

What happens during the process is that your stomach expands to take more food in all at once so your stomach always looks like you are pregnant. The best cure I found is to eat small amounts of food every 2 hours and to never eat to the point of being full, this forces the stomach to shrink to a normal size again. However there is also another condition, some people store fat in the intestines.they are finger shaped fat cells that extend along the entire length of it.Best cure, life style exercise! not excessive which is too excessive...	post_2382624

post_2416932	Jan 27, 2008	400517	None	Tracy	Any, yes any, physician can order a medical test, and genetic testing is no exception.    The problem is that there are thousands of genes that cause many hundreds of medical problems.    These tests can be expensive and unless there is serious reason to think a particular gene is involved in your health, it is not even remotely cost effective to go hunting.    But, if you have other family members with a condition known to be inherited, then it is reasonable and prudent to have yourself tested.    Usually it involves a simple blood sample or swab from the inside of your cheek to obtain the DNA.    A Genetic doctor is best at determining if you might gain value from such a test; often the easiest way to find one is by contacting a group of genetic counselors, often at a nearby university medical center.    This person will meet with you, collect the necessary information, discuss your options, discuss it with a Genetic physician and give you advice about what could/should be done.    Most of the time doctors in other fields don't know what genetic test to order let alone from where to order it.	post_2351336
post_2415667	Jan 26, 2008	400517	None	Kineks - Angry family genes	Hello.    VHL is caused by mutations in a gene on chromosme 3 of the human genome.    It is called a "tumor supressor gene" because, when it functions normally, the gene controls cells from becoming tumors.    But, if there is a mutation in the DNA strand of this gene, then cells can become tumors.    You inherit this gene from one parent, and it passes from generation to generation with a 50% risk for each offspring (you either give the gene without the mutation, or the one with it, in your egg or sperm.    It is not clear why some family members will have tumors in different organs despite having the same mutation.    Any doctor can order a DNA test for you to find the mutation.    One of the best labs is:    http://www.bumc.bu.edu/Dept/Home.aspx?DepartmentID=118Once you know you what the mutation is, anyone in the family can easily be screened for that DNA change.    A member of your family who absolutely, positively has VHL should first be tested by sending a blood sample to the DNA testing lab.    His/her doctor can arrange this and insurance should cover the cost.    Once the mutation is known, it is fairly straightforward for you, or anyone else in the family, to send in a sample for a quick screen (since the mutation will be the same for everyone in the family).    You can even avoid giving the mutation to the next generation by using a technology called PGD . We used a lab in Michigan (Genesis Genetics) and have two healthy babies without VHL.    Knowing if you have the mutation (or not) will streamline your medical care.	post_2406497

He work for Haliburton for 23 years than retired he had it for 6 month -to a year.when he. I did ask some of the guys if they notice anything different and it almost costed him his job. Than he went down on me. / mad at me.    It was only once in awhile that things would happen.    staring at wall, at things like he did know what they were.    couldn't see the kids in front of us in the store- hungrey after only eatting acouple hr. - thought it was low blood sugar- after he ate about an hour he was fine but moody.    While driving he would stop at intersection and freeze than I notice if he got up set things would happen.    He put Ice cream in the microwave for a min and than it was soft enough to eat than instead of putting it back in the freezer it was put in the mircowave and left it.    Hungrey for chocolate and ice cream one 5 quart pail a week.    chocolate as much as you could buy.    coffee got so stronge that no one could even sip it.    loseing his glasses or cup was way be fore the 7 years so I don't know how many years it really has been.    He started to work for a grocercy store for our insurance and worked the night shift cleaning floors and stocking shelves.    He would come home from different direction every day.    He took our daughter to school one morning and that was 8:ooam and the school is 4 blocks away and she was late for school.    I think he took her to the grocery store and than figured out the school.    They both won't say any thing about that day.    They can do things that they have been doing but the new things are hard for them.    Roger will ask me about every thing where does this go. What do you want to do with this.    But they can hide it alot.    He also didn't want to belate for work.    He slept until noon and then sleeped from 7- 11pm and the last 2 months he started getting up dress every half hour -15 min- 45min all different time and finally the last day I went to bed and held him down every time he woke I kept saying sleep it isn't time to get up.    So that was when he had to quit.    He still takes care of the rabbit and cleans the frontroom and the yard.    He does still drive his bike and the car if I'm with him.    Roger is on Arceipt and Namenda and the Best is Arceiipt.    They took him off it a month and he lost 2 years.    write down the things you see him do or have others write down things he does and if you can get him to a Neorogist/sp .    They done test on him and couldn't find anything wrong and said he was highly inteligent missing only one thing wrong on all of their test. But it isn't every day it may be two week or a month than every other day.    That is why the people who is around him alot should watch.    If he was mild he may become aggessive and if mean may be the niciest.    Roger was so mellow and didn't talk much.    Now will stand toe to toe and always mad over the smallest things.    Wants you to help but don't want to be helped.Look under pick's disease Frontal lobe Dementia One doctor in England has it and he does thing alittle different but other thing the same.    It is hard even for me knowing he has this because he can do so much one day and not the next.rbcf	post_3223348

But as I say he drives a long way 3 times a weekto work, he is 67 , which is exhausting and he is so tired doing it.At work it is a practical job so he has no problem doing it as it is repeteitive, but he admits to forgetting some things he does.

Have him draw a clock and put all the numbers in it and say a time and see if the small hand and the big hand is in the right way. simple thing if he misses one or two things.    Than he needs to go in.    They can still hide alot of things. They know but don't want to know what is really wrong.    They are scared. So was I when I had to face life with out my husband being able to do the things we wanted to do together. unemothional is part of picks. After I had surgery he was more worried about cleaning the rabbits and doing some laundry than helping me to the bathroom and never even brought me anything to eat all day.    By second day he want me to get up and cook.    I was haveing spasms / back surgery.        He use to cuddle on the couch and hug and kiss me now he won't even talk for hours while I set beside him.    Our daughter call him mean. Write down the things you see and date it.    I told Roger if he didn't go to the doctor I was leaving .. I really had a hard time getting them to believe.    When he gets stressed does it happen more.    Also did he have Sleep Apnea ? Did he stop breathing in his sleep and all at once take a deep breath- than slept a little and does it again.    Watch him some.    I    tape him one morning while he was mad and not being resonable.    So they could hear him not understanding .    Well I got to go.    I'll catch up later.    Alz. may also fall into this type of behavior.    take carerbcf	post_3223348
post_3265415	Aug 11, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	Thank you for the infromation you are giving me I really appreciate it,Yes he does have sleep apnea, has for years, but we use seperate rooms now as his snoring kept me awake all night for many years and I couldnt take it it was depressing me.I have done the clock with him and me and he did okay on it, I find the worse thing is his lack of any Empathy or interest other than negative regarding me or any of the Family, but hes still nice with other people, he was always a self centered Man but its definatly worse, I doubt if others see the change yet, although I have noticed it for about 4 years, He did have a very big bang to his head a few years ago, wouldnt get it checked out though you never could get him to a Doctor,I will start to make notes, my other headache is he wants to do everything his way, including what we do with Savings tec I try to get tough but he starts to shout and gets angry at nothing, actually I tread on egg shells most of the time, I have no one to talk to about this and the Anxiety of it sometimes is overwhelming,as I worry about his future , your input is gratefully recieved	post_3223348
post_3265431	Aug 11, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	He is very forgetful and has been for many years but we put it down to usual aging,and he liked to forget his Phone no on purpose,its the Behavior changes that are hard its as if he is another Man now.	post_3223348
post_3306048	Aug 20, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	how is it going ? Last night my husband said it was cooler outside than inside and he wanted all the windows open but still wanted tha air conditioner on.    I said windows open , air conditioner off.    He got mad and had a fit so I did it just to satisfly him and he went to sleep and I shut the window. He couldn't figure out the ice cream machine at the resturant and on it was written in big words choclate swirl, and vanilla but he didn't know which was which.    Simple directions are getting really hard for him to do.    We were putting the sm. airconditioner in the bedroom and I asked him to move the fan and he put it right in front of the window.    I said we needed a adater three prong to a two prong and he brought me a power strip.    I asked him to take out the screem out of the window and he went to the other window.    He has helped to put the air conditioner in for the past 6 years.    Now he can't understand how.    He can't see things in front of his plate or a fork that is out.    He reached over and will take mine.    I hope things are better for you. take carerbcf	post_3223348
post_3314000	Aug 22, 2008	535822	None	cbcf	He isnt that bad yet, but he does lose his temper more easily now I have to walk on egg shells, but he still does his work okay, if I ask for help he doesnt want to help me he is very contrary, I dont think he likes us doing much together any more he seems very Distant.and even Hostile at times, I try not to think too much about it as its scary, but I am also concerned at his Judgement in money matters, He odes do odd strange things as you said, I have always been part of a couple with him and its the aloneness of it that I worry about, until its bad enough for the kids to see and I doubt if they will know what to do then anyway ,they will stay out of it.hey Ho I guess like you possibly did I have to wait and take it as it comes, I didnt expect this and I really have a hard time believing it . Thanks for all your input it had helped me a lot.I am sure there is a club of Care givers to join, I dont think I will ever get him to see a Doctor.	post_3223348

post_3315837	Aug 23, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	I have been online reading up and he does seem to be dispaying a lot of the Symtoms(symptoms),the stories from the caregivers wre similar, I have joined the Support Forum so I can get a Handle on it and try to do what I can, thank you for your support.	post_3223348
post_3370876	Sep 06, 2008	535822	None	None	I have learned he may be allergic to the Toxic chemicals he uses in his work and that this could cause the behavioral Issues, just wanted to update what I had Posted here.They said once he stops using the Toxics used in Boat manufacture he will imprive ,now I have to get him to leave his Job!!!!!!	post_3223348
post_3374632	Sep 07, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	Thanks for the update. things never seem to be easy to find but if someone digs deep enough than answers are found.    Never rely on one doctor    if the things don't seem right.    I found another good medical help spot    check out www.helpguide.org/elder/alzheimers- disease dementias caring    caregivers.htm    they have little line down between the words but the first part to Alz. should get you there.    Good luck and hope he can get another good job.	post_3223348
post_3378056	Sep 08, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	Yes thanks he probably wont get another job he'll work for himself, and my battle will be getting him to leave there,at all. I have also actually been going online reading up about the Toxins used in Boat and Furniture manufacturing, its not good theres a lot of nasty stuff out there and over many years he has never worn a mask on a lot of the Tasks. Hey Ho, we shall see, Hope you are doing okay, yes it has been good to know others have the same problems I have found these forums very comforting., and they keep me from over worrying.	post_3223348
post_3382551	Sep 09, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	My husband worked around alot of chemicals for Haliburton oil service and I always wonder what thoughs chemicals did to him.    But he said the company did okay for him so never looked into them.    I work in Maintenance at a hospital and the sulfid chemical got to me and some others.    All my joints swelled up and I got a rash.    Steroids to bring down the swelling.    They would do test to see which one gave me the problems.    I did get Migrane(migraine)headaches with stroke problems .    I got rid of the husband and the job and the headaches almost went away.    My husband had viking football on his mind and the monday night was on friday sat, sunday and I couldn't get him to understand it says Monday nite football , Monday.    / so he went everyday all day long looking for his football game and couldn't find it and it was me that was wrong and I had to straighten out the chanels.    On and On    He finally got to see it last night.    My nieghbor and best friend is in the hospital dying of Lymphomia.    she is 88 and I don't think she will come home.    She had no Kids and Her niece and nephew are her power of attoney which I 'm been takeing care of her also am selling her vegetables for her because she can't .    I've been doing it for 10 years .    Well they got the key and went through her house and when I went up too see her afterwards I told her about it.    She didn't give them permission to do it.    I sure hate people when they do that.    I just want her home again.     Take care and hope everything comes out.	post_3223348

I hope you cope with all this, you have a lot on your Hands, I guess it keeps you busy, I try not to think too far ahead now as I get so freaked out if I will have to cope and How I will manage , whatever is the cause of it, its wont improve I am sure , its not too noticable yet too much especially to other people its mainly towards me its directed, Hope your friend does better but perhaps her prognosis isnt too good I hope you get through it all.	post_3223348
post_3404526	Sep 14, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	My friend passed away and I was thanked and told that I could still take care of the yard and water the things , also shovel the snow for Mary because Mary would have liked it.    and I was dismissed like I was a farmhand.    They were going through the money she saved from the garden / I think she save almost all after 10 years    and used very little .    I took some pictures of her over and found them counting it on the front room floor.    Thanks for the picture and We'll take care of the rest.    Than Vic said we talked it over and I should have the money that I got from the sale the other night and he handed me the $17 dollars and told me to keep the rest from the tomatoes that wasn't sold yet./ two flats left.    I've spent hundreds of dollars on Mary and didn't do it for money.    It was almost like a slap in the face.    I left it on the table and told them to put it towards Marys funeral.     They put my name in the ob. and said speacial nieghbor and caregiver.    I wasn't her caregiver I was her friend and took her on family vacations and took her out when ever we went - when they forgot her on xmas and holidays she came to our house. My friendship and hers was the thing which We both got, not money .    I hope that they find out what true friend are.     they thought I was dumb enough to take care of the place even after they got it.    Mary even would have laugh at that on. No way I got to get my things off and they can figure out how to do it.    When Mary had bad problems no one came to help just me and the other nieighbors.    We were her family.    They think they are Christian/Vic is a deacon and he is so good but I would want to be around people like them. Mary's house flood when the neighbors house pipes froze and not one of the family would come and help.    I helped for 3 months cleaning up and throwing a way 9 dumpster of ruined items and 4 van loads of thing to give away.    Vic came twice to take load of wood to burn and get tools from there.    I hope people will read this and think about how they treat their family members. Sorry got carried away but had to get it off my chest.    Thanks for being there.    I hope This never happens to you.	post_3223348
post_3429817	Sep 20, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	I absolutly know how you feel ,I am sorry they treated you like this you deserved kinder behavior,    what is it with people do they not know what kindness , and integrity. She knew you wre her friend to the end so it doesnt matter about them, but it hurts I know how that feels.My Mom was Mary also , she had a hard time near the end and I have to tell you I was here in the US and she was in England I was making arrangements for her to come here,and she died without anyone around, I have never forgiven myself.,problem is you think you always have enough time, but you dont. I have to live with it and I tell any Women like me that are travelling to drop everything and take care of their parents when the time comes,or try to live with the consequences. I think you will feel better soon and simply think of your friend and how much you helped her.Hope your Husband is doing okay, mine seems the same I am still hoping its Toxins and it will improve when he stops work, but I could be in a bit of denial.	post_3223348
post_3439676	Sep 22, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	well they came to get some of the things from the house and I got my things out and the things that I gave her    to use.    Just the pump from the flood to get.    I paid around 175 dollars for rental of pump and than just bought one.    She didn't have the money so......I asked for some of the Peonys and a couple of other plants which she loved or they willsell them with the house.    I guess I'm more up set that they the family can be so callus and unfeeling.    Maybe it will come back home to them.    Well I got some xmas oraments that I gave her back and will write her name on them and put it on the tree to remember her and when my daughter gets her own place she can have them.    Everytime I see the flowers and colors she loved will help me remember her.    Well Roger has to go to the doctor and he wants to practice the clock and we will see how he does. He can't get the numbers on right for the first 4 tries and than he got the numbers right. We will practice a few times more and than if he can't get it he will blame me because I didn't help him remember again.    The T.V.controler is beating him also. Now he only wants to go out to eat. He puts on a pair of pants than takes it off and puts on another puts the other is wash and takes a shower than puts on a different one .    I had around 6 pair in the wash in three days.    Of course I told him what he was doing and he got mad.    I need thicker skin.    Monday nite football he thought it was on friday ,sat, sunday.    I kept telling him Monday nite football on Monday.    He kept getting the controler messed up all day every day trying to find Monday nite football.    Than he would tell me that I should have told him it was on Monday.    Boy it sure was along weekend.    Now he is on keys for his car.    He locks the keys in the car and than can't find them and is going to get a locksmitth - told him I had a set but had to get two more made and now is out in the dark trying to find the new keys.    A book that went with the voltage tester    he keeps takeing and putting it with other books from the care battery charger and lots of other book manuels also the cars.    He got rid of the registration for the car.    I can't keep up. I feel like getting drunk and I don't drank    hahahaha......I hope your husband will get better. I pray mine does.	post_3223348

I made what I consider a break through, I googled Neurotoxins and came up with some very interesting stuff, and anyone reading this Post may be interested if their husband has unusual behaviors and forgetfulness , All of his 'symptoms'are listed as a cause from breathing in Solvants and all the toxic subsatnaces used in    boat restoreing and building Industry ,this is what my husband has worked with for many many years, I came to this Forum thinking he has Alzheimers,or Pick's and I still cant get him to a Doctor to get a Diagnosis, Howver he did listen to me and I printed out the information on the site , I simply told him I was really worried regarding his memory and behavior , and I wanted him to read it and consider if we could get some tests done, he said Yes!    I hope he means it.I am going to google more as I am not certain if this can be turned around now or will get worse, if anyone out there reading this knows any site or any more I would be grateful to hear about it,End tale I hope he leaves this work soon, and of course I hope it is the Toxins and it can be reversed when he stops using them.	post_3223348
post_3441450	Sep 23, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	It is a relief but still you have a long road ahead like me if it can't work out of his body.    This morning he was still onto the keys and kept telling me I had them.    I started to back track every where he had been and found them in the van in the cup holder and blames me.    I have mine and the cup holder is in the passenger front side.    Some days you don't want to get up or just leave and let him fend for himself.    Than you have to set back and relize that he isn't doing it out of meanest but I sure wish I could talk with him and not get frustated and raise my voice so much.    Last husband blamed me for every thing and Made me pay for every thing and he spent his and mine money like water.    I said I wasn't going to take it again with out a fight.    But They wear you down until you don't want to be around them any more.    My husband worked for Halliburton and I asked him about all the chemicals and he said no to checking them out .    He said they did okay by him and didn't want to change any thing- He gots Picks and it can't be changed.    Good luck and I told my husband I was going to leave him if    he didn't go to the doctor and he did.	post_3223348

post_3452948	Sep 25, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	remember the notes and how long it has been going on.    Even if you can tape him doing the things with out him knowing or he will come down on you big time.    It will always be my fault and I don't treat him like a husband because I don't listen to what he says / I do when he makes sense and don't when he doesn't.    It is a very hard thing for a man who was good at most things to not be able to do what he done most of his life.    Driving on a trip with him is the worst and we can only go on a 3 or 4 day trips and even that is almost insane.    Yellowstone he was going to leave. walked a 1/4 mile away.    I sure thought about leaving.    Than it was a gas thing I didn't fill up and it was near dark.    He went at me for70 miles and when we filled up I still had a 5 1/2 gallon out of a 12 gallon tank.    He screamed at me all the way.    I want to have some family time for our daughter of 12 to enjoy before it can't be had.    good luck.    Do you have any kids that are sensible?Have the kids come for a weekend so they will be with their father for a good amount of time. Get him in a place that is unformilar to him which should set him into something he is doing that isn't the norm.    They may see it.    But even Roger's oldest daughter didn't seem to notice much except when he stop in a intersection and stopped instead of turning.    We all yelled.    After that she drove around seattle and tacoma.    We were glad to get back to N.D. Good luck what ever you do.	post_3223348
post_3454566	Sep 26, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	Having made a head way last week where he agreed to get evaluated for the Toxins he is going back on his word,I may have to wait till he is worse and then he will have to come with me to sort it out, I keep plugging the fact that there is a new drug called Rember' going to be out after the trials finish(maybe 2 years) he seems to listen, Reading your post it is obvious I do not get the Issues that you do ,yet. I keep hoping its the Toxins but this week he says he wont leave that job, so if it was the Toxins then he will still be ingesting them, he says they arent Toxic even though it is Catalogued that the stuff he uses is definatly harmful, Denial all the time. My kids are all grown with their own set of problems and some live in England there is only one here with her Family and nopt too interested in us . I am feeling stronger this week however I seem to have accepted I have a problem and will have to either deal with it or Walk away,Thanks a lot	post_3223348

post_3461093	Sep 27, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	yes I see the same.    Some people have other ways to find their answers to their problems.    I went to the monthy Alz. meeting here in north Dakota, America and they didn't know about Picks so the help was minimal and so until his brain dies back in to the Alz. timer area I still don't have the knowledge of some things.    Also each person has different things that happen with the disease.    I can't stay on anymore . I fell and got a concusion last night and just got out of the Hospital.

Wasn't bad until I went in a store with floresent lights, and than started to see spots    and started into headache so got out of there- it triggers Mirgranes / stroke type with me.    Well a few minutes later felt better.    I hope I don't get the Mirgranes back like the last time I got a concusion.    Today My neck, back and arm was sore.    210 lbs falling shook the earth.    Boy I'm glad I didn't remember it happening.    Roger was great today until we came home than got alittle out of sorts.    Funny how he can be normal and change in an instance.    He started to unload things from    the bags while we were driving home and putting it on the dash.    I ask him to put it back in and boom , mad. Well I got to get thicker skin. Where is frontal lobe Forum? There is a doctor in England who has Picks and he talks about how it afects him I think his wife helps him with it and It is quite interesting.    I'll see if I can find it again.    Let you know later. Take care.	post_3223348

post_3549212	Oct 19, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	Hi! Well been busy trying to keep up with Roger and the yard work.    I had to clean out the rain gutters and got up on the garage and Roger fought me and wouldn't move the hose around and it bumped the ladder and it went down .    Than Roger wouldn't pick it up and let me down so after he screamed he hated me and left for 20 min.{ I kept cleaning} Than the neighbor came out and set up the ladder for me after Roger jumped into his face and said I wasn't supposed to be up on the roof.    Well I got down and he was mad for a week    and it keeped going.    Than nice again.    I take one step ahead and five behind.    I got to go to the badlands building and get help on how to talk and work with him.    He expects me to know every thing and to teach him how to write and do things again but he doesn't trust me either.    A; simple shower is getting hard because I put in a whole new shower and he thinks it is all new and can't figure out how to use it.    The only thing he has to do different is don't push the knob on the spout until he turns the water off.    Full fight every time I show him.    How is your husband doing. ?    Has he gone in to see the doctor yet? I hope you don't have as much trouble .	post_3223348
post_3549363	Oct 19, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	Good to hear from you, no he hasnt gone to the Doc,,he said he would and that was it, I have been lulled again for a couple of weeks that he was okay,it is possible my having said he should visit the Doctor and he saw    I was concerned ,caused him to make an effort to be nicer, but this weekend a few set backs again, nothing like you are going through ,,yet. I think one has to have a lot of tolerance and patience more than looking after a child.I think you are still a few years ahead of my situation, I am still thinking it is Toxins (possibly I am grasping at straws aswell ) time will tell.His temper has been better.	post_3223348
post_3554812	Oct 20, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	If the temper is down that is a plus but if it is like my man it will come back.    My be he has another problem and needs to talk to some one. I myself will after alot of problems run very short of temper and he may know something and don't want to face it. Roger fought like crazy saying nothing was wrong but after everyone    confronted him and than he finally said he knew but was afraid what it may be. Does he have a friend that he hangs around with.    I tried to ask one of the guys at work and all h---- broke lose. They had a meeting and almost lost his job.    May be another couple that you hang out with. The husband may have talked to her.    But don't bring it up like it is really big problem . Just say my husband has been out of sorts and you wonder if she notice anything. Does he have to go to a doctor routine phyical you may send a note to the doctor and see if he can check things out.    Explain what he does and see if he can get some test.rbcf	post_3223348

I may have to simply play a waiting game , we are going to visit our daughter at Xmas so we will be around them for over 2 weeks., that may be a test to see if anyone else notices anything, hes often on good behavior in front of others though.	post_3223348
post_3573808	Oct 25, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	Well I'm going bananas' He had battery acid in a bottle with no lid on it in a box on shelf and I reached up for some tools and bump it and it fell over and got the shelf, floor and on me.    Which I got mad and he said nothing was hurt and I was making a big deal out of nothing,    i ran in and got some baking soda and spread it over it and was still mad.    I told him he can't have battery acid with out a lid.    I said what if our daughter had bumped it and got it on her or me in the eyes.    He didn't think I had the right to get mad. Well I washed the clothes and found the shirt I wore and it was holes down the front of the shirt and down the top of the shoulder "Close to my chin,    Boy I took that shirt and threw it at him and told him that was too close to my face.    He didn't care and just got mad at me.    By the way he was in his normal state of mind that day and he still didn't care. But was mad I even brought it up.    He doesn't get it that if anything happens to me no one will take care of him.    I got a woman comming in next week to see about some caregiver counceling and maybe for our daughter.    They also will do caregiving    so I can have off but I still can go out for a few hour and I got a tracfone incase he or our daughter needs to get me.    Than I was cleaning our garage and he kept comming in and almost drove me out of my mind.    He kept grabing thing and moving them after I put them somewhere and I told him to leave it alone and over and over.finally I got mad and told him to leave and let me work.    It was like he was two years old.    He went in the house and sulked for 3 hrs.    I dread the time I have to put everything under locks.    His temper plus mine is getting really bad. Last night He got upset and kept telling me the motor cycle was in the wrong place and he needed to get around it. It was up to the lawntractor and he couldn't walk around it.    I told him that he could move it back to the more roomer spot if he had to work on it .    He screamed at me that it wouldn't work that way , the motor cycle was never in that spot. I told him it was in that same spot every year for 10yr. and the worse thing about all this is his lack of trust in me and he was never that way in all the other years.    It goes that way most every day now and I wish I had him back to normal loveing and careing person he was.    I can't even hold him because he pulls away from me.    At least he still loves the animals { I think I'm jeasous and I love them also} I hope you or anybody else never goes through this...... Well got to go.	post_3223348
post_3577204	Oct 26, 2008	535822	None	None	Sounds like a big battle , I feel I am getting some of this also, I kind of back off, I am still hoping he will leave that job , but he seems adament he wants to stay there, what can one do, its simply a waiting game and having to accept a lot isnt it, I havent felt well this weekend , have you noticed that there is no empathy at all?	post_3223348
post_3577590	Oct 26, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	Yes They don't have any feeling for nothing except the animals and will say they didn't do any thing.    My daughter is doing that also.    I didn't do it.    Roger doesn't go around the computor and she and me do. The chair was cut and than it got cut again.    Than I came in on her pulling the fabric where it was cut and she said she wasn't doing it.    A new bag of jerky was almost eaten and she said she didn't do it and Roger doesn't like it.    He was outside with me cleaning up leaves and She didn't do it.    Man somedays you want to see what she has in that brain. The teachers now want her on adhd med and now that is $150 plus a month.    pretty soon we will just be a eating pills to live and forget the food. That will make 500 dollars of pill out of pocket amonth and 1000 dollars a month of insurance.    over half of our income in medical bill.    I would like the doctors and Teachers to have that bill. Over half of their income and to live in poverty income.	post_3223348
post_3586525	Oct 28, 2008	535822	426039	rbcf	Why not try the Food supplements before you get her on the Meds,as they do have side effects and you may have a problem with her behavior from them,the Meds I mean, I have read recently that a good Multiple Vitamin-mineral with Vit B Complex and Vit C and also fish oil are beneficial to children with ADHD and even though its not cheap it is cheaper than the prescriptions and less invasive than the prescriptive Meds.You are right about the costs and I fear it will get worse.	post_3223348
post_3590986	Oct 29, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	Done tried and have her on fish oil, kelp.vitamin-mineral and other type of vitamin, She refused to eat certain food/most she    really will fight to the death to eat.    We finally got her to eat yogert and forceing her to drink apple, orange    and apples ,    oranges she will only suck out the jucie and After awhile you want to just throw up your hands and say you don't want to help yourself and get ahead you live with it.    I'll keep trying to get her to eat more as we go along.    Some day her brain may mature and she will understand what she needs to do to help her self/    My prayers are going out everyday.    I got going about 8 th grade where I could remember and understood more.Time will see how she handles life and growing up. She has allergys(allergies)to mold rag weed and lots of other things so they may be acause of some things.    She took shots of thing she was allergic to for 2 1/2 years but some thing didn't help.    We'll keep trying .	post_3223348

Roger want to still do things but even the simplest stuff he isn't understanding.    Raking leaves we have a bag holder and when I was mowing the leaves up he put it up.    I got it set back up and after mowing more I went to empty and he had put it away again.    When I told him I still needed it He go mad and than I get mad..... On and on.	post_3223348

post_3609615	Nov 03, 2008	426039	535822	margypops	I live for the days that he is himself and the loveable man he can be. but it is getting further and further apart. He dieing and in some ways I dieing with him.    The hardest part is our daughter calls him mean and those are not the memories I want her to have.    When she was a baby he held her and they stared at one another and you could see the love he felt.. He played with her and loved her .    Worried about her.    Now he is always mad at her.    When she tries to hug him he gets mad.    Just like me. The best memory of him and her together is the day Roger was teasing her about her belly button and she would pull her shirt out and look down at her belly trying to see it, she was 15 months old.    I got a lot of pictures and I will put them together of just them and the loveable dad she had.	post_3223348
post_3632223	Nov 08, 2008	535822	None	None	That is a great idea to put the pictures together for her to see them, that must be the hardest part and she is so young to be seeing him like this,we are having an okay time but I am still finding I believe it is the toxins he works with, last week he had to do some Epoxy" work on a boat and some other guys were working near him,I went to see him and I had to come out as the smell of the Toxins in the air was horrible,then on thurs and Fri he threw a tantrum over nothing and was g'rouchy for a coupke of days, now its the weekend and he is fine, he still denies it at least openly.	post_3223348
post_3857685	Jan 09, 2009	426039	535822	margypops	Hi sorry I haven't written .    Roger had a    great week from the 20 to the 25 of dec and he was his real self and very loveable than the 26 he found the outside faucet that he turn on and it had froze open (-16 with -35 windchill and said it was frostless) No valve is frostless at that temperture well he wanted to turn the water to the house off when we had 7 people in the house and than he wanted the water shut of in the street to the whole house and I said that all we have to do is turn the main line off but not than and he came at me mad as hell and I had told him not to turn it on when it was that cold to get the water for the bird bath in the house.    He was going at me with 5 kids in here.    The next day he said he could kill me and he hated me.    I got to get some med from the doctor to keep him from getting so mad all the time.    Well I went to the Alz meeting and had good talk and of couse no one know anything about Pick.    But was told about glyconutrient supplementation    check it out http://glycomn.com/index.php and www.livingsugars.com    One man has his mother on it and she is doing good and gave me the paper on it.    sounds interesting and will go and see a semenar on it Tue jan 13 I might try it on my daughter she doesn't eat right and it may help her with her ADD .    How was your christmas and husband?    Has he gotten any worse or staying the same?rbcf	post_3223348
post_3858370	Jan 10, 2009	535822	None	None	I went to England for Christmas and have been back a few days, well sometimes he is fine and others not I am convinced it is the Toxins he is working on, I have kept an eye on his behavior and it is worse when he is working with the Epoxy stuff and Teak wood and the powerful glues used in wooden Boat and furniture making, I am somewhat releived to know this, but I also feel if it continues it could become permanent, so I keep asking him to leave, however in this climate he rightly is concertned he wont get anoyther job so we have that dilemma, so I have been Enduring and keeping my mouth shut, he did have 2 explsosions in England so my kids have seen a little now. I think you are having worse stuff than me , its hard to bear sometimes isnt it, I find the tantrums are the worst especially over nothing.	post_3223348

Everyone is tired of snow.    winter wonderland.    three ft of snow drifts around the house and it is supose to get cold again -17 not counting wind chill and than by this weekend it will be 30- 40 above. than the floods will come than more ice.    Well it is nice to have moisture but wish the ground was not frozen so it could get into it.    After the drought condidition for the last few years.    We may have a chance.    I have another thing to look at.Glyconutrient supplementation.    they also have something for heavy metal detoxic please check out.    http://glycomn.com/index.php and www.livingsugars.com    I might get it for Christy and than Roger if I see any change.    There is a seminar tonight in town and I'll see if it is worth it.    I know they want me on afew different types and it 250 or more well not rich enough and most things don't really work.    Neighbor says it is like what amway sells.    But this is going into the Male clinic and was being tested.    they are growing plants on mineral water and takeing the plants and making it into a powder or drink.

post_3887709	Jan 18, 2009	426039	535822	margypops	boy, I know what you mean about worn out.    The new pill is doing a nice job for 4 days only mild upset and he kept opening the bedroom door and the cottontail rabbit kept getting in under the bed.    So Speedy had to stay in his cage.    he is wild but was only in the first week of life when we got him no hair and eyes close about three inches long and doesn't like to be penned up for hours or days.    He is usually good but a few wires have made it into his mouth.    the dog and rabbits gets along great and if one could believe a rat terrier and wild rabbit could be friends and love to chase each other, than eat pomagrantes seeds together,    The rabbit has bitten the dog not the other way around.    We are having a heat wave now 40 yesterday, 38 today and 36 tomorrow. but the snow is still high out side.    and by middle of week will be cold again.        Where are you living at?    I can't remember what the pill name is but I will try to get the name for you.    May be it may help him on though nights.    Roger has been sleeping most of the night great.rbcf	post_3223348

Well aftwer klast weks blow up, he has been his old self but guess what hes not at work till Tuesday so not in the toxic enviroment.I love to hear about your pets, I seem to have inherited a stray unless someone else owns him I say him but its a calico and I am told they are mostly females, very sweet nature but what do I do about fixing and shots, I need to find out if he belongs to anyone else.	post_3223348

post_3900829	Jan 21, 2009	426039	535822	margypops	make a few posters up with his pictures- take to the animal control, local veternary/sp , grocery stores in the area, Most cats are not lost but love to get out and than go back home.    Unless he is very lean, bad shape he probably has a home.    They will go about five miles.    We had cats on the ranch and the nearest neighbor were 3 miles and the other 5mile the closest so when we visit them we found our tom cats and of course their many new children.    after a few weeks you may want to get him checked , to see if he is got felin cancer.    Over here it is getting alot more common.    Male seem to give it to the females.    But don't buy alot of things for a few months because if someone shows up the money went down the tubes.    My one dog kept running because of load noises and ran until she dropped .    I call the polices had it on the radio and searched for her.    People would get her and buy food and toys the first night for her she hated toys and mostly wouldn't eat some of the dog food.    I thanked them but I couldn't pay for all the thing they bought.    And that was the first night out.    Someone threw firecrackers at her so around every fourth of july    she started to run.    But cats love to leave and return.    So if you have time let the cat out and follow to see where she goes and she will lead you home in a round about way.    But if she stays than you may have a cat. Roger has had a good week. so far on the pill.    He can get upset but not as intent as he did.    Low dose Risperidoneo.5 mg boy I wish I had done it sooner,    one a night.    May be if you could tell him how it has helped my husband    and ask yours and see what they say.	post_3223348

A couple of snaps    me more My daughter said to take some too.    She just became a woman and now Roger is worried about all the pms going to be around this house.    Hopefully mine should be getting done in the next couple years.    How is the cat doing?    We will have to see the doctor again in March so have a few more months.    Been trying to clean and go through a lot of my things.    I will have start boxing stuff to make it easier to clean and Roger won't get too worried about stuff every where.    It finally has been nice to be with him again. I have another picture to paint for a lady and I got    to get into the mood.    I use to paint 800 to 1500 paintings a year from a teaspoons to walls.    I just can't get into the mood or someone takes me away all the time.    Betcha can't guess who.

post_3986592	Feb 13, 2009	426039	535822	margypops	Happy Valentine Day! Cats are fun to be around but they do like to hunt.    I don't like them on the tables and Their hair is worse than the dogs. But about like the rabbits.    We have one tame rabbit and a Cottontail {wild type} rabbit which I raise wounded and orphane animals .    Two squirrels babys and three cotton tails in the last five years.    A cat got my nineteen month old cottontail male in the yard which I wish the people would keep in the house.    and the Squirrels were killed by cars which went out of the way to kill them.    They were living on there own and come home to get food.    But they had a good life for awhile.    They will be alive in my heart for ever.    One good thing about cats they can be left at home for a few days but dogs have to be cared for more.

I love my dad but he gets in my face and says he hates me and calls me a ***** and *****.     Tries to hit me and is a total jerk most of the time.    I have lost it a few times and just have to walk away.    Have she ever been sedated?    I was telling mom maybe we need to do this to dad when he gets in these moods.    Is that bad?    We can only take so much.    Youe last statement I can relate to.    My sS Ha good days and bad ones.    Mostly bad ones...    He is still at home but I dont know how much    longer we can take this.Mom and dad r divorced but mom still takes care of him at her home.    He doesnt pay any bills except groceries and get 1900 a mth.    Go figure......    I tell mom to tell him to help but she has and he wont.    So what to do?????	post_3178102
post_3555541	Oct 21, 2008	253653	327086	medicmommy	This is a very common stage of this horrible disease. My mom, who is 5"2 and weighs half of what I do had me up against a wall with my arm twisted behind my back. She was admitted to a behavioral health unit as the assisted living facility couldn't manage her behavior (that's another story in itself). She had meds adjusted, and yes was like a walking zombie for a few weeks but it did help us all get through the violent stage. There are people out there that are adamant that AZ patients not be treated with psych meds or sedated but when you are on the receiving end and nothing else is working, like distraction, calm voice etc, you do what you have to do. You just have to be careful with the meds, watch for side effects and eventually they won't need them. don't keep them on them forever. My mom had severe extrapyramidal side effects from Effexor XL, not to mention the seizures because the AL staff was crushing it!!!!	post_3178102

I am a little embarrassed to say I had forgotten I had posted this item.I have been detoxing off opiates since July 19th and life is not a lot of fun right now.    Good days and bad.     I will make it since I don't really care for any medication.    I am on    19 prescriptions right now and would like to make it zero, but that will never happen unless the Starship Enterprise winds up in orbit over us.    :)I will search for that right now, my brother is 70 and he is slipping too.    At least I can whine about my morphine moments.    :)Take care and best wishes for your mom.    My dad had it.    My mom was lucid until her strokes at age 89.     I told my wife and kids, if I get Alzheimer's and I am abusive to her, put me away.    I have an Air Force retirement and disability that should pay for it.Better yet, divorce me.     Don't let the gov't take everything she has.    Divorce me, put me in a facility (my niece runs one) and be happy.I miss my Mom and Dad more than words can express, but there is a time for us to leave these bodies.    Cherish every moment you can, while you can.    I pray your mom is ok.    I am not sure if you said your mom had Alzheimer's and took this medication or if your mom is no longer with us.

Yes, we saw immediate improvement.    Without it, she would sit and sleep all day and hardly communicate.    Now she is bright and cheery, and while she doesn't engage in full ongoing discussions as she used to, she talks and has comments and laughs, it is amazing.    It is expensive, yet is being advertised on TV now for Psoriasis treatment, and is also approved by insurance companies for treatment of Rheumatoid (sp.) Arthritis.    It isn't approved by insurance co's for Alzheimer's treatment, but it works!    For more info write back!    Blessings to you, have a wonderful day!	post_3078259

He will fight over every little thing.    He is going to be 66 in sept.    My husband will be at home until He can get into a VA home but it won't be until we get down to 85,ooo dollars in asset. or 2000 in the bank.    It costs around here $5000 dollars amonth.    If he don't have nursing home insurance they have to pay it all until social service can help.which means you have nothing. He can hit and it is best to back up and out of sight at times.    See if you can get help in home through home health /what it is called here.    Go to hospital and check into it.    Nurse may be able to come in and help with the bath checking and giving meds.    It all costs money.    He may not fight them because they are not famaily .    My husband takes it out on me/ frustation.    Put your self in their shoes and think what would happen if you didn't understand what was going on.    They don't remember what they did most of the time.    Not taking baths and fighting is part of the things they do.    He sounds more like Picks because normal and than not normal than normal.    You never know when he can do something or he can't.    Nursing homes are not all that great- I've worked in one and the aids leave the patients on the toliets for long times. Or doesn't come to get them to the bathroom so long that they have accidents. My friend had her call lite on for over 30 minuites and I finally stepped in the hall and caught someone comming by , it than took them another 20 min.    to come.    She was in tears.    The flu came and she got it and was gone in two days.    When flus get into there the patients all get it.    I have seen people that had food shoveled food in their mouth as fast as the aids could and almost choked.    I've seen aids stealing things and patients also.    One friend I went to see was strip down to under wear no covers and a fan on him.    He was so cold the bed was shaking and he got sick and died that night.    Most of the times the aids are in a hurry because the place only allows them so much time with the patient that they don't even get asked if they need anything .    We had a woman that was 94 and blind.    she was walked from the bed to the bathroom to a chair no one came to see her most of the day. Than from chair to bathroom to bed. after nap back to bathroom to chair. than to bathroom to bed.    The only time they talked to her meals and bathroom calls.    I use to stop and talk with her and she would almost fall out of the chair balling because she was so lonely.    I fell in love with her.    They don't get the love or the enviroment they get at home and a lot of the people go down hill faster when they go in.    Go in and see what it is like .    Listen to the screams at night and days of some.    Some people do good some don't.    I've seen from both sides.    My mother in-law also had alz. and she didn't get anybody to talk with her.when I came up she didn't know my name but said there is my freind.    and I sang songs like the one she loved and she would sing with me. After I lelf no one came to talk with her and she set in a chair day in and day out.    Find things that your father loved and see what he will do. He is scared and the frustation is so high.    find something that he can do that he can't hurt him self.    Talk about family and things he done and when and maybe hug him- say you're sorry even if you have nothing to be sorry say you love him often and find things that will make him laugh.. Some Alz.    Units /homes are not bad.    check on activity and maybe before he goes in have him spend some time there- here they will take care of people like adult day care.    Get him out to one of these places and see how he does.    I have a lot of trouble with my husband-He wants to drive and he got mad at me for a week when I said he could drive his motorcycle and he sceamed at me for 5 days over and over .    I had a mirgrain for the last 3 days and finally blew up and screamed at him to leave/he said he was going to leave and so I packed his bags and screamed back at him to leave over and over. I tossed the bag at his feet and said leave.    He got a sober face set down and said he wouldn't divorse me and he than said he is stuck and so am I.    He quit going at me on that.    THe one thing I figured out is to get out of sight when he gets mad and than come back to him later.    If he has Alz. you should be able to distract him.    Picks their Memory is better and you can't get him onto another train of thought. Sorry this is so long.    I hope it helps. Also check wiith Alz. association and they might know other things to do and when it is best.    If he gets mad at your Mom than it may be time.    If you get him into a nursing home or other place don't fill bad.    I told my husband I would try to take care of him until I couldn't but if he started to try to hit me or our 12 years old he would leave sooner than later.    I hope this helps. Wish you the best.rbcf	post_3249282

He lies alot about everything.    I know his brain isnt working right. I understand that.    But he wont give in with me.    He wont even look at me and talks bad about me to my mom.    It really hurts.    Today my mom said he showed her a place near his groin about the size of a volley ball.    She said it looks like atheletes feet.    I suppose fungus.    Where he wont bathe.    She put some ointment on it and washed it real good and told him he will have to do it again tonight.    He probably wont.    My daughter came up to and she is a RN she said fungus.    He dont have much to say to her either cause she is my daughter.    Thanks for the input and caring thoughts.    By the way I stayed with an alzhemiers patient in her home for 4 yrs and she was a sweet lady like you were describing. Her family took her out of nursing home cause they didnt take care of her either.    She would just smile when I came in and would stroke my hair and would say pretty.    She couldnt speak but one word at a time and she couldnt feed herself or bathe herself.    I could tell what she wanted or meant just by looking at her and talking to her.    I wish my dad was like this instead of mean.    She had 24 hr care and I loved her.    I stayed a few nights thru the week and From fri- sun morning.    Plus I worked a 40 hr wk elsewhere.    Thank you for your posts.	post_3249282
post_3254486	Aug 08, 2008	426039	None	Nuggetone	Was your dad really nice person when he was younger?    Think of what made him laugh what was his favorite place, Who did he like to see of his friends ,    Ask your Mom if she knows.    Maybe if he likes animals bring one in for him to see .    Roger liked his parrot but wouldn't let my dog in the house only when it snow so deep that he couldn't get into the dog house.    Later when he got old he was in all the time and Roger changed    and started to like animals and fell in love with a rabbit named Inky.    We also had a cottontail name bun.    He has been taking care of the pets now and that is what keeps him going.    He is in love with the dog Topsy, rat terrior, He won't hug me or kiss me which he use to cuddle all the time now he turned his love to the animals. But they don't tell him he can't do things or treat him like a child.    That is one thing My husband says to me I am your husband don't treat me like a child.    I can not get though to him things that he don't understand and I get frustrated also. I try to say it several different ways hoping he can understand it .    Than after saying it more than twice I catch my voice raiseing and he says I'm yelling. Which in turn gets him mad and yelling back.    Than things get out of hand and I try to leave him alone until he calms down.    But it isn't easy to do every thing by your self and Your husband says we should do it this way and you know it isn't going to work so you do what is right even though it goes against his ways of doing things.    If your    Mother is only 64 she should be still in charge and unless she has a problem Let her make the choice of what to do.    64 isn't that old and she will be better at working with him .    Are you married?    How would you take to your kids telling you how to live.    Would it be better if your husband worked with you or the kids. If I was sick and My husband was there it would be easier to listen to him. but if my daughter came and told me what to do when I done it all these years I would put up a fight.    My mom fights my brother and any one else also.    It is a rule of thumb Kid will fight and so will older people with set minds. Ask your Mom what she thinks and ask her how he can get better care. There is a time when people know when something has to be done.    Your Mom will know if she opens her eyes to see with your help.    Ask her advice what she wants done.    Most people go in and only see one side of things.    Have a deep talk over coffee in a place that is comfortable and just ask what she needs help with and say to her If you need help I'm here and let me know what you and dad need.    Their lives are turned up side down.    There is fear of the unknown and life changes.    I'm trying to plan for the future / what future/ don't have family to help so It is just my daughter and Myself but go on and take one day at a time.    Was your Dad a Vet?    Get your mom and family to go to an Alz. support    group.    They will tell you what happen in their family and how they cope with their problems.    Sometimes a little thing is so easy you think it can't possibly work but it does.    One lady said that to get her mom to be unbeliveable happy was to give her a gift and she unwrapped it / the box and wrapping brought so much joy that when she wasn't looking her daughter took it back in and wrapped it again.    gave her it again and again she was just happy.    like a small kid.    She didn't remember the item in the box but getting presents was the great joy.    Here I go again I talk write to much.    My time away from things.    Remember Let your Mom and Dad make choices.    What kind of life does your Dad have left. He don't want to spend what left away from his wife and home and he is scared.    Think about what you would want. Would you want to live in a nursing home staring at the walls, setting in a chair,smelling urine and hearing screams , moan , waiting and waiting to go to the bathroom or be at home where you can go to your own bed, watch tv until you want to go to bed or    wait for dinner and you have to eat cold toast waterdown potatoes, get up same time every day and go to bed before it is dark. Very bad unless you really didn't know what was going on around you./ that is the time when it is okay to leave your home when you don't know much else. That is my hope to do with my husband , home until he doesnt know what is going on around him.    Than and only than will I fill I did my best. unless I can't take care of him because I phyically can't.    I took care of my dad until I couldn't lift him by my self/ very bad back but he passed away that night.    I had a back operation. so I hope I will be able to do better.    Also I would buy a lift like at the Nursing home and will plan on using home health and Hospise if he stays home.    I know I can't do everything    on my own . And please don't blame your self if anything happens because you can't do everything either.rbcf	post_3249282
post_3262268	Aug 10, 2008	171791	426039	rbcf	No my dad wasnt a vet.    He was a manager of grocery stores for 25 yrs.    He was a joking type person but could always be short tempered too.    I am divorced with a 25 yr old daughter that is a RN,    We do the things she tells us as she workd at one of the finest hospitals here.    I only go to dad telling him things when mom cant take no more.    I guess I am her support group.    Dad has a dog, a pug.    He loves her. His daily life consists of lying around watching sports on TV, sleeping, watering plants and sometimes takes out garbage.    He dont want to go anywhere.    We ask him all the time.    However on fathers day he asked me to take him to church and I did.    He hasnt gone back.    He has one friend that still comes by to see him maybe 1 time a wk.    He use to work with this man.    He has been so rude to others no one wants to come around.    My B-day was Aug 3rd and he knew it cause mom talked about it.    It was the first time in 45 yrs he didnt tell me Happy B-day.    He didnt speak to me.    However yesterday he did say a few words casually.    Oh and one of his past times in eating alot.    He wants to eat all the time.    He weighs 300 +.    I have had back surgery and cant tug on him.    Mom is in cast and cant do that either plus she has back problems.I did look up pick and it does sound like him so I printed it and mom is taking it to the DR. tues when he goes. Mom is    a very giving person and just says she will have to do it all plus help from me.    We both get frustrated and I cry and she asks whats wrong and I just tell her its hard to have my dad treat me this way. Anything he says to me is demeaning towards me even thou I know what he is saying is a lie.    My dad told my mom her hair look like someone set off a firecracker in it cause she has been in bed with surgery from leg and cast and of course her hair is not fixed.    She said well your sticks to your head cause it is so oily, you need to wash it.    Of course he got mad and mom said well you throw atones so I did. I have lost about 12 lbs lately trying to do for them and my home and I am exhausted.    I take valium at night to sleep and that is the only peace I get.    I work 40-50 hrs a wk and go to work like nothing is wrong and sometimes I break down and cry in the bathroom at work.    I clear my face and go bk out    and put on that fake smile but it is so hard.    I know nursing homes are not all wonderful but maybe assisted living to give mom peace.    I worry about her too.         My dad said I got 11 tomatoes day before yesterday off the plants and 11 yesterday and I said well how many today and he just said I told you 11 but he said the day before yesterday and yesterday not today.    I didnt say anything    back.    He just doesnt realize he has a problem.    Seems so simple to some people but it can wreck your world.	post_3249282

I couldn't 'sass' dad, but I get angry with my husband (4th yr into Alzheimers) He is so hard headed & he too, doesn't like a bath. He will go for weeks without one until I take sheets off bed until he gets in shower. He seldom flushes commode, he picks his nose ALL the time. Do either of you have that problem with your loved ones? It is a hard life, but with The Lord's help, we'll make it. Will be looking forward to 'chatting' again. I just joined.	post_3249282

post_3084742	Jun 25, 2008	327086	543694	doc19	To my knowledge, Alzheimers doesn't present with head pain and slurred speech prior to the confusion, etc...But TIA's (mini strokes) and CVA's (actual strokes) do...Has she had a CAT scan? Or an MRI to check for blood vessel problems or a tumor? This is something that needs to be done NOW. If she's had previous tiny strokes the scans will show areas of damage...If she's had these tests done right after an episode, get another radiologist to read the actual scan...Sometimes small, but devastating things are missed by one set of eyes, and picked up by another...Your email got crossed out in the submitting...	post_3078568

post_3095942	Jun 29, 2008	327086	548444	suz239	It sounds like there may be more than one thing going on with her...Get in contact with her Dr (if you haven't) and (in private) discuss your concerns about her "failure to thrive" and have her evaluated...It sounds like she may be suffering from a severe depression..You haven't said why she's on Alzheimer's meds...Is it a trial thing, or has she actually been diagnosed because of memory and behavioral issues?Nobody wants to move away from what they know into a place where they have to live within the rules of others but, if she is becoming a danger to herself (eg, forgetting she's taken her medications, and taking extra doses, or is having frequent falls, leaving pots to boil dry or burn on the stove,etc), and needs the care working age children can't supply on a 24 hr basis, assisted care may be the answer for her...Good luck...I know there is no easy answer, but if you have her evaluated, and have a prognosis of a continually deteriorating health picture, it may be the safest thing for all of you, and the best thing to do for her care...	post_3095226

She takes Zoloft 50mg daily and doesn't protray sx of depression at this time. She seems to be progressing in the Alzheimers. She is exhibiting aggitation and behaves passive aggressively.

post_3100871	Jun 30, 2008	327086	548444	suz239	I know this sounds a bit heartless, but here's another thought...As far as the driving goes, is she in a community where she can drive a golf cart (something with limited range and speed) rather than a car? The reason I ask this is, it's pretty horrifying when you get that call that she's completely disoriented to where she is, and when you go to get her, she doesn't recognize you either...This happened with my Grandmother who suddenly got a whim she'd drive to the volcano (Mt St Helens) and pick out picnic spots for us kids...she got about 10 miles from home and was lost in familiar territory...Her driver's license was "pulled" after that, but it was devastating to her independence...In assisted living, there is transportation available, and needed socialization with others her age...It's not the same as living independently, but still better than dying in a preventable house fire or getting lost and not finding her for a week...If financial means are available, perhaps a live-in (or 12 hour) aide with a visiting nurse 1-2 times per week would be a better option. The aide can drive her to where she needs, and assures she takes her medications and eats more healthy while providing 24 hr supervision, and the visiting nurse monitors her medical condition...This usually provides a lot of support to working caregivers and to the patient as well...Take care...	post_3095226

It is very progressive and eventually you will have to consider a facility that specializes in caring for alzheimers patients.    May I suggest a book that my moms doctors told me to get and read.

My father takes a number of medications, including those for heart failure.    Heart problems eventually led to kidney problems.    Ironicly, The heart meds can affect kidneys adversely. The doctor has monitor Dad's meds very closely. When Dad is in heart failure he needs additional dosages of diaretics.    Too much diaretic can effect kidney function and too little will effect heart function.

I watched my father die last year in October while Drs did nothing to prevent his death and I will not sit and watch my mother in law die because nobody will ask questions.    Her heart functions well so I don't think it has anything to do with that.    I am gonna find out what meds she is on now.I hope that your dad stays well and God Bless you and your family.	post_3106812

But i do know that old people (specially who live alone) are scared of not having anybody care about them.    A lot of them are very emotional and tend to worry a lot that can affect them and their health a lot.    Communicaion helps, if they are living alone, call them frequently.    Calling them will also let you know if she is ok or not.    If staying togather take her for a walk in the evening.    Showing that you care will help a lot.    Also, after you start commuicating, she will communicate with you as well.    She will tell you if something is wrong or there is a problem (how is she feeling and what is she thinking).    Besides i think communication will just make her feel better if not anything.    Also, be a good listener.	post_3015367

post_3035564	Jun 13, 2008	532802	323615	Bev170	Thank you sooo much!    I am the only one Dad has.    My kids live too far away and my husband helps once in a great while, but basicly its me doing it all.Yesterday something happened that never happened before.    First of all, Dad called me at 7AM.    He gets night & day mixed up sometimes, so that surprised me.    He was very depressed. He told me he felt like walking out    of this life.    He sounded teary eyed. He didn't think I would understand.    I told him I did, and inside I was sick with worry. He asked me to find another place for him to live where there were other people like him who would understand how he feels. Although he already does live in such a place, I assured him that I would look into it and call him back.    In the meantime I suggested he rest. I live 30 miles away and it takes me about an hour to get to his apartment. I called the nurse to alert her and she is to have the geriatric psychiatrist re-evaluate his meds. I called Dad's priest.    I am not Catholic, but Dad is and I thought a visit by the priest would please him.    When I called Dad back and told him I was waiting for a call from Father M., he said "What for?I don't understand.    Why would you do that?" When I related part of our 7AM conversation back to him, he said, "you're making this up".    I was relieved that he had forgotten.Now I know better what to expect.    One day at a time they say.Concerning your mother, I've have observed some elderly with aggressive behavior and that has to be very hard, especially if she was not always like that.    It takes alot of patience love to face that situation.    About CHF, my father uses "No Salt", but in his kitchen the other day, I found a nearly full, open box of Morton Salt out on the counter.    He had run out of "No Salt" and was putting regular salt in the "No Salt" container to make it "No Salt". No wonder he gained 4 lbs last week!    Sometimes I have to laugh or I'd cry.	post_3022943
post_2961882	May 27, 2008	518603	376800	Striddle	It's important to realize that the use of anti-inflammatory agents to treat Alzheimer's disease is based entirely in the theory that the disease is the consequence of an inflammatory process. While some studies claim to indicate success with slowing the onset of the disease, you must realize that the disease is quite variable among patients so comparisons between patients are somewhat subjective. In other words, the measurement associated with forestalling the disease or its progression is problematic.If you or a loved one have received a diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease, it's critical to obtain second opinions because there are many diseases and disorders which can mimic the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and yet, remain more treatable in most instances. For instance vascular dementia presents itself in many ways like Alzheimer's, except that damage to vascular patency causes significant delays in the utilization of newly learned material. By contrast, the actual pathways to storing new information for the Alzheimer's patient have been disrupted or destroyed by amyloid plaque development. There is also a "mixed" variant, wherein both vascular and Alzheimer's dementia are present.In the case of many elderly patients, the pattern of poor memory and behavioral changes can just as readily be due to clinical depression, a disorder that is quite common in the late middle-age and geriatric population. Definitive testing is always necessary to rule out the presence of depression before making considerations associated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease. In depression, the cause for poor memory is actually due to interference from factors of depression, so the information is not properly stored or retrieved. Lack of attendence to new information can be just as debilitating to an elderly person as the effects of Alzheimer's disease. In fact, depression in the elderly is commonly known as "pseudo-dementia" for a very good reason. Unlike the morbidity and mortality associated with AD, however, depression is very treatable.Among those already discussed, there are a multitude of other dementia-causing diseases such as progressive supranuclear palsy, parkinson's disease, dementia with lewy bodies, cortical basal degeneration, posterior cortical atrophy, motor neuron disease and many more. It's imperative, moreover critical, to regularly monitor and measure changes in cognition of the affected person because in the world of neurological disease all roads lead to Rome.In other words, the early onset for most of the diseases mentioned all begin with similar features, excepting only several key symptoms that would more accurately define the disease in one or two cases.There are several cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and although as mentioned earlier that anti-inflammatories are questionably responsible for early prevention, the anti-inflammatories do possess side-effects that most often appear in the form of GI errosion.Discuss alternatives with your family doctors and if you believe that you are predisposed to Alzheimer's disease, genetic testing is available with a very important caveat; if the test proves to be positive, the insurance industry will all but close the doors on availablity of a long-term disability policy so great consideration should be given before such testing is undertaken.best regards,OWS, MD	post_2933536

post_3335254	Aug 28, 2008	603141	None	None	My father is 67 years old and has multiple physical, neurological and communicative problems as a result of traumatic brain injury. I provide total care 24/7. In dealing with bed sores or ulcers, his bed and mattress are important to prevent pressure spots. He has an electric homecare bed, with rails, and selectair mattress system. The mattress is an 8 inch air mattress that is connected to a unit that constantly circulates air in the mattress, under him. The firmness can be adjusted and there is a setting for when his bed is in a sitting position. The bed, rails and mattress system will cost around $8,000. The air or gel overlays that is placed on top of a regular mattress did little to help with pressure spots management, in my experience.	post_3007061

I have never come across so many people with so many credentials, so little common sense and practical knowledge.Last night I watched television with her until 11 P.M. while she cuddled to my arm and watched "Stagecoach".

The way it was explained to me is that my Dad does not want to see anymore doctors.    And he has told me that as well.    He also sometimes refuses to take his medications - and he can't be forced to.    Hospice is suppose to oversee all this and take some of the responsibility off the assisted living facility.     He will still be given his meds, and everything will remain the same other than a hospice nurse will visit him every other day to monitor him.    I know - I always thought hospice was a place, but it actually care.    Very confusing.    It's just that to qualify they evaluate and if they believe the person has less that 6 months to live then he/she qualifies.    That is what scares me so much.    I really have not told my dad about hospice - I don't want to scare him as well, because he may remember that my mom died days after being put on hospice - she would have died anyway - but it is just a mental thing with me (any maybe my dad)    -    thanks for responding - nice to talk to someone about my feelings and not have to be strong	post_3118159
post_3120216	Jul 05, 2008	174368	None	tarponbond	My Father had cartoid artery surgery on March 15, 2005. so he would not have a stroke due to blockage, well, during the surgery he had a massive stroke.    The doctors gave him one month to live.    I quit my job, made my livingroom into his bedroom, and took care of him.    He lived three yrs. after being told that he only had one month.    At the end, maybe the last year he was on hospice.    A few times he aspirated food and normally when on hospice they would just make him comfortable. I just could not stand there and watch him suffer, so I took him off hospice and took him to the hospital for antibiotic IV. As time pasted, I knew in my heart that he was getting a little worse, finally on Feb.    8, 2008 he went into a coma, I stayed by his side, slept in a recliner chair every night, that lasted for one week, one week later on Feb. 15, 2008 he past away.    It was very hard , even though Hospice was there.    Don't let ANYONE tell you what to do, YOU DO what you FEEL in your HEART that is BEST for your DAD.    Let me tell you, you won't regret it. I spent 3 yrs. of my like taking care of my Dad and making decisions and doing the best I could, I wish I could do this all over again.    I miss him so!    But I guess when our parents get old and we know that they are going to die sometime, us kids are never ready for it. I think sometime we think that our parents are going to be there forever. If you feel Hospice can take some of the stress off of you, let them, but don't let them make all the decisions for you.

The secret to handling it was to all learn that the emotionalism was caused by the medication, and to personify it separately.So when Swampy's mother would yell at someone, we would sort of all look at each other and say "wow, that was a good one, medicine". Swampy's mother would then giggle and say, "well, the medicine really got me that time!" and we would go back to whatever we were doing.This was possible because of the way Swampy's family works, we have a sense of humor that extends to talking in a very blunt style, then laughing about it.

The rate by which this will develop is unpredictable since personal characteristics vary.    It is important at this time that the person engages in brain stimulating activities, and be encouraged to continue reading that can somehow lower the rate of progression of dementia.Regards.	post_3087870

Since we live far away from each other, she brings the medicine with her and I know she's taking the same things.I truly believe her stress level at home creates the forgetfulness. My mom can't remember almost choking me to death when I was 17! (I've forgiven her.) But she also can't remember calling me 2 hours ago and telling me something.See if you can lower your stress. If you can, take holiday for a few days and see if the symptoms improve. Additionally, most drugs for anixiety and depression stop working after a few years use. This may be what is happening to you.	post_2925037

I am also verry stressed and sad knowing that about 1/3 of babies born to single umbilical arterries are born with birth defects; therefore, this chance increases by having both markers.    I'm 20 weeks and 36 years old.	post_3136270
post_6216864	Oct 05, 2010	1227139	None	jpaquette & Magnolia574	Hello Ladies,Sorry for the delay in responding.First, an EIF or Echogenic intracardiac Foci is a bright spot on the heart (an absolutely harmless spot with no health issues caused by or from it) that if found alone without other "markers" for common or uncommon genetic abnormalities can be typical and of absolutely no consequence.    EIF's are harmless spots but in the case of genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome do often tend to be there or found in people who have genetic or chromosomal abnormalities.    When they are coupled together with other markers as I mentioned, it increases the likelihood that the baby could have Down syndrome or an other genetic abnormality.    Which is why the EIF is a known genetic marker, as well is the SUA (Single Umbilical Artery).A single umbilical artery like the EIF, when alone can mean absolutely nothing but coupled with another marker has the same definition    - meaning can be a marker for a genetic or chromosomal abnormality.My son, who is now 14 months, was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome (Ds).    Originally the ultrasounds did not show any markers let alone an EIF until after I had my amniocentesis at week 16.    At my week 20 ultrasound or later they discovered the EIF, knowing that he was prenatally diagnosed (Dx) with Ds.    It was one of the only markers my son had that remained until his birth.    I myself am now 37.I do know that at the moment, this is very stressful and not quite what you would want to hear.    I know it certainly was not something I wanted to hear, but please let me be the first to reassure you and also to tell you, Ds (and I know - trust me) is not what you might think.    If you were at all like me, I had some very preconceived ideas about Ds before I got the chance to do some deep research.    And, if there is anything I can do to provide you with a realistic view (to put your mind at some ease) please check out my blog.http://welcometoourhouse-myjournal.blogspot.com.I have a lot of helpful references in my blog, articles and also everyday information.    Lot's of photos too.    I know first hand what it is like to go through the prenatal testing, without any idea of what to look for or to know.    I can also tell you what next steps are typically offered or what should be looked for after you are at this point.I have a complete listing of markers that you might find helpful, for your upcoming ultrasounds.    I can also offer you information about Amniocentesis or other more definitive testing (as opposed to screening which I can tell you more about too) if you want any information about those.    I know that without my Amnio, the u/s techs probably would not have seen the markers and we definitely would have had the shock of our lives since my maternal risk was 1:385.    The only reason I chose to do an amnio was my age (35) at the time.    Nothing else.    My NT scans were normal, as were my original blood work and u/s.If either of you are interested to have some additional information regarding the Single Umbilical Artery and also the EIF, please message me directly - I can provide you with the details directly, since it is quite lengthy to put into a post.    I have a website that I am building currently with all this information - prenatal testing, markers, Ds Info etc. simply because I know how it feels to be in this very situation without the correct information or positive information.    My website is not due to be up and running for a while yet, but I do have all the info that you are looking for.    I also have a direct phone line for support and information.    It's available to anyone out there who is interested in calling for info.    (The number is listed on my blog, as is my email address.)I have provided this information to probably hundreds of mom's because I am an appointed parent support guide from our local hospitals genetics department, so please do let me know if I can help.I know it's hard to find good accurate and positive information.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_3136270

post_3450890	Sep 25, 2008	631182	None	Pantu	Hi Pantu,I've got the same. I've had them checked 4-5 times over the last 8 years and the medical practitioners, in their less than 30 second inspection, have all concluded that they are Lipomas.I have them on my legs (between my hips and my knees) and a stack of them that seem to have roughly formed along a line formed where my rib cage meets my stomach area (i.e. in a big inverted U on my middle torso at the front).Some of them a quite painful to the touch and I'm concerned about them being dangerous as well.David :)	post_3254731
post_5749126	Jun 02, 2010	1334162	None	None	are they dangerous, my doctor doesn't think I should worry about mine, all in the chest area, one in particular is very painful and I always know it is there.     I got a 5 second inspection, said they were just    lipomas, nothing to worry about.    Then my doctor said they should not hurt.    Then, I am worried because they do.    I just lost 2 aunts and 1 uncle to cancer, my mom, my sister and another aunt are struggling with cancer.    They just found a bunch of cysts and nodules on my thyroid.    They will let me know if I should be concerned about them.	post_3254731

post_2875680	May 07, 2008	419309	499349	zokodent	Most genetic disorders that are caused by a major chromosomal abnormality, like Turner syndrome, are not diagnosable by using ultrasound (even 3D).    In order to detect a chromosomal abnormality, an amniocentesis can be performed, usually done between 16-18 weeks.    Even though your sister has Turner syndrome, you are at low risk for having a child w/ Turner syndrome (the risk is more increased if the mother is of older age, 35 or older.)Hope that helps.	post_2866918
post_3855941	Jan 09, 2009	731566	None	eureka254, zokodent	My daughter has Turner Syndrome, and we've gone through all of the education with the geneticist and endocrinologist.    So let me just correct a couple of things that eureka254 responded to, in case someone else searches and pulls this answer up...Turner Syndrome cannot be diagnosed through ultrasound (correct), but it is usually found in the Triple-Screen bloodtest that is standardly given to the pregnant woman.    If there is an abnormality in the blood test, then an amniocentesis is recommended for confirmation.Turner Syndrome IS NOT GENETICALLY PASSED ON!!!    There is absolutely no greater risk because of a family member having it.    As the doctors said to us, "It's a genetic fluke!"    AGE IS NOT A FACTOR (that was incorrect, eurekea), past behaviors (such as drugs or alcohol use) is not a factor...there is NOTHING to pinpoint a cause or prevention.    EVERYONE HAS THE SAME RISK, which is 1 in 2500 girls.	post_2866918
post_4430277	May 05, 2009	795082	731566	dstnyx	i want to thank u for clearing that up. i had a stillborn due to the complications that turner's gives while she was still in me. the only reason they found out i needed to be tested was cuz the ultrasound showed hygroma and hydrops. and that was at 20 weeks. but it wasn't found in my blood test. as u said age is not a factor i was 22	post_2866918
post_4435463	May 06, 2009	419309	None	dstnyx/others	claire38:I'm very to sorry to hear of your loss.    My condolences to you and your husband, and best wishes to you in the future.dstnyx:    perhaps the information you received from your geneticist and endocrinologist is specific and correct for you and your case, but it's not entirely accurate.Some cases of Turner's syndrome go undetected prenatally, both by ultrasoud AND by triple screen blood testing (as claire pointed out above, it was NOT found in her blood test).    In fact, triple screen blood testing does NOT assess risk for Turner syndrome.    It is used to assess other genetic abnormalities, specifically Trisomy 21 , Trisomy 18, and open neural tube defects, and actually does not address risk for other chromosomal abnormalities.It is correct to say that Turner's syndrome is generally not inherited, but it IS a genetic condition, and although highly unusual, there are cases of "gonadal mosaicism" that (though very rare) COULD cause such a syndrome to be "genetically passed on" or inherited.Genetic "flukes", or more correctly, chromosomal changes, INCLUDING Turner syndrome) ARE more common in pregnancies for women over the age of 35.    That's not to say that it doesn't happen to younger women, it does, especially since more younger women are having children than older women, but a woman's risk for conceiving a child with extra or missing chromosomes (called "aneuploidy," which includes Turner syndrome) DOES increase with age -- NOT everyone has the same risk:http://www.expat-at-large.com/thesis/Chapter13.htmHope that clarifies things.    Best wishes to all.~eureka	post_2866918

Creatinine is removed from the body by the kidneys; as kidney disease progresses, the level of creatinine in the blood increases.An amino acid essential for the breakdown of fat into energy. Carnitine may improve the utilization of fats for energy and can be beneficial in conditions associated with impaired fat breakdown and energy production. .Hope this helps.	post_2907010
post_2999271	Jun 05, 2008	204318	528083	Shanally	I was wondering if you had any veins that were broken and can be seen through your skin that was'nt normal looking ?	post_2999153

post_3007814	Jun 06, 2008	204318	528083	Shanally	Yes because they are getting ready to do testing on me to see if I have EDS and I was wondering if that was part of it?	post_2999153

post_3469436	Sep 29, 2008	561348	528083	Shanally	I too, believe I have EDS and went thru Bariatric surgery 7 yrs ago.    I lost 180 lbs and the skin redundancy is HORRIBLE.    Unlike you, at this point, mine does look gross and saggy. (REALLY BAD).    I am now 5'7" and 135lbs.    I wear a size 8 and feel better than ever about how I look.    But, the skin has to go. As far as I have found, (thru 7+ years of research and lots of exercise), there is no way to pull the skin back and unfortunatley I have had no luck in getting the costly surgery to remove it, covered by insurance.    I thought it may be covered, because the excessive redundancy is due to a medical condition of its' own, but no luck so far.If you know of any information different than what I've found, I would be appreciative if you could share.    There really is very little info on this syndrome.	post_2999153
post_2963654	May 28, 2008	520459	None	None	I would highly recommend you see a geneticist to help with a complete diagnosis. It sounds to me like you have had to come to the conclusion yourself in regard to which type EDS you have. I am no expert, but know it is very easy for a layperson to get this wrong. Even if it is a correct guess, it is best to be 100% sure than risk having another type. Though the actual gene typing for HEDS is unknown there are ways of eliminating which type of connective tissue disorder you have by mechanical tests.If you are subluxing (Partial dislocations) these cannot be passed of as CFS as that is not part of that condition, your doctor is failing you by doing so.	post_2962323
post_2964470	May 28, 2008	520104	520459	sue_denim	Hi,I am rarely subluxing (sorry if that isn't rightly put, english isn't my first language), unless that's what's happening to me when my articulation pops, hurts a little and SEEMS to go out and back into place... But that's not very hurtful and I'm sure dislocation is VERY hurtful. And I've never ever had total dislocation (cross my fingers it'll continue that way).But I sprain A LOT and tear ligaments.A little less often now that I know to take care (I was about 21y.o. when a physiotherapist I was seeing for a sprained ankle first told me I was hypermobile, explained what it meant and helped me a great deal by giving me tips. She told me I probably tore 3-4 ligaments in my ankle with that particula sprain, but what was the use of pushing the investigation further? None. Well not in our healthcare system, not in my situation : young teen, female, not a professional sport... just a dancer at the time. Had to quit of course. BTW, it's the the physio who told me not to try and do something about it!).So anyways, I also have strechy skin, although not the extreme type, and bruise kinda easily, plus don't heal scars easily. (I didn't think I had the strechy skin, and didn't think my hyperextension was very extreme either, but I just saw some pictures online yesterday, and I realize, altough I'm still sure it's not extreme, I guess I'm at least in the norm...)All those things get worst with years, including the injuries and pain... I used to sprain by catching a ball or landing a jump badly (well and all those silly regular things too of course, that's our lot isn't it? But the "silly" kind of injuries were usually less important, like no ligament tear), now it's just getting easier and easier to injure myself.Last 2 tears happened at once, along with cartilage tear, in my wrist, when I put on my vest (agreed, in a sharp movement, but come on!... THAT one impressed my physiatrist!... finally he understood the full extent of my problem.)So yeah, I know fully how much my rheumatologist is failing me. What's dangerous and frightening to me is I'm guessing I could start a cancer or have serious cardio-vascular failure in the future (which could really happen, with both CFS and EDS background... CV failure is saldy usual with CFS and I already have low blood volume), but whatever new symptoms I'll tell him about, he won't see them as a sign of anything, won't ever investigate, but just will pass it as "normal, a CFS symptom"... Oh, and of course, since it's a CFS symptom... theres never anything to do about it, just "endure".Problem is, with CFS, even with a doctor knowing about the condition (rare enough), there are so many symptoms (up tp 50 in one person, I for myself never counted... too depressing), varying in severity and over time, that the doc starts to put it all in one big basket. And if the doc doesn't take CFS seriously, than each new symptom is just proof of your hypochondria or other mental condition he's convinced you have! (I work with a local association for CFS/FM, you wouldn't believe the stories we hear...)I'm pretty tired about this doc, but until I can find another one, I do need him to prescbribe me the right meds. My GP, even my physiatrist, would never even dared give me such powerful pain meds or other types of meds to try and help with the symptoms... they simply couldn't understand the extent of the illness. To a point, he could.I see him next week and I hope he'll agree to try 2 different meds, one for the pain (not more powerful, just different and easier on the side effects), the other to maybe help me feel better, targetting the CFS directly, for once (anti-viral). If he doesn't agree to either med, believe me the search for a new specialist will jump to high gear! ;o)Thanks again!	post_2962323
post_3436363	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	None	I have CFS and EDS too.    (Hypermobility type).No, there is not a genetic test YET for the Hypermobility type of EDS, although I expect they'll have one eventually!The definition (and this is straight from the horses' mouth as I am just back from a conference attended by experts and fellow sufferers) of Hypermobility Syndrome is:JOINT HYPERMOBILITY + RELATED SYMPTOMS!    (You are just 'Hypermobile' if you don't suffer!)Check your joint hypermobility rating using the Beighton Scale (Google this or look at the British HMSA site for info).Unless it is suspected you have the deadly vascular EDS (unlikely as it's rare), then you'll probably be assessed through a questionnaire and physical examination.    If I were you, I would get hold of the leaflet for diagnosing HMS, or print this information off from the HMSA website and take it to your doctor!Good luck	post_2962323
post_3436300	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	Inanna	Hi InannaI too have EDS (type III but may have to be tested for the vascular type as my aunt has just had a burst artery and she also has EDS).YES, in my opinion (I'm not a medical bod, but I have just returned from a weekend Hypermobility conference with the experts, and I do keep up to date on the subject) everything you list is ABSOLUTELY related.    These are all so typical of EDS.Test yourself on the Beighton scale and see how many you score (you say you are Hypermobile).    Normally if you score highly on the scale, and suffer, then it is likely you have 'Hypermobility Syndrome' (considered equivalent to EDS Hypermobility type).If there is Marfans in the family, then your grand daughter needs proper assessment!    With the parents both suffering from inherited connective tissue diseases, then she will need to see a connective tissue expert to get a diagnosis I would have thought.I hope this helps!    Just some thoughts for you...	post_3196861
post_3357843	Sep 03, 2008	90270	None	None	I would take him to a geneticist who specializes in EDS....It certainly sounds like he could easily have EDS. I was diagnosed officially in June of this year, but have known for quite some time that I have it as I also dislocate easily, have stretchy skin, have weird stretch marks and scar very easily. I am also very near sighted, have a high palate and have TMJ.I hope you find answers....Sunny	post_3239570
post_3436269	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	None	I totally agree with Sunny (see also my other posts of today).I bet your son bruises at the slightest thing too!    Am I right?It is very important that you get him diagnosed, as if there ARE some vascular issues in the family, then this might determine the type of EDS you/he are diagnosed with.    Each type is very different, but there are some crossovers of symptoms.You absolutely need an EDS expert and not any old rheumatologist!Best wishes	post_3239570
post_3436255	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	None	Hi thereI too have EDS and significant spinal problems (herniated discs, Tarlov cysts, unstable SI joint etc).I have been to a conference this weekend with all the UK leading experts on Hypermobility/EDS.    The subject of exercise came up a lot, and anything that stabilises is deemed to be the best - physio from a Hypermobility knowledgeable practitioner, Alexander Technique or Pilates.I find Pilates very helpful, as they concentrate on core stability - we hypermobiles tend to work our big muscles at the expense of smaller ones, so they work on developing strength in those.I had a bad experience at a conventional chiropractor.    DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO 'CRUNCH' YOU!    The pressure needed to make an adjustment to someone who is Hypermobile is minute compared to that needed to adjust someone not flexible like us.    Therefore, they can launch in and damage you if not careful.    I have permanently damaged discs now from over enthusiastic chiros.I now go to a miracle worker - a cranio sacral practitioner - it is incredibly gentle but complete MAGIC!    She works on fascia etc to release and balance.    This is helpful for my lumbar spine and TMJ problems.I'm not a medical expert but hope this helps!    Check out the UK websites as we do have more EDS experts over here!    See my other posts today, as I've answered some more bloggers!Best wishes.	post_3241020
post_3260222	Aug 09, 2008	419309	None	michelle	Learning disabilities can affect people with normal chromosomes as well as people with abnormal chromosomes.    It is unclear to me from your post whether or not your son has been diagnosed with a chromosomal difference.Chromosomal re-arrangements (and cases of missing and extra chromosomes) can be inherited, but more often than not it is a new occurence, an isolated occurence.    (It's estimated that about 1/3 of people with re-arrangements inherited the change, and 2/3 are new occurences.)     Keep in mind too, depending on the type of re-arrangement, even people with chromosomal changes very often have no disability at all, learning or otherwise.    Depending on the type of chromosome testing being done, results can take 2-6 weeks.    If changes are found in either yours or your son's chromosomes, genetic counseling would be recommended.Best wishes to you and your son,~eureka	post_3257872

post_3325713	Aug 25, 2008	419309	301640	shellsa	Chromosomes are the genetic material that is a part of every human cell.    (The typical person has 23 pairs of chromosomes.)    The genes, or DNA, are like long strings, or "codes," that make up the chromosomes.     Think of a chromosome like a big long key, that has many etchings of different sizes (genes) that give instructions to unlock certain doors.    Although there are usually 46 chromosomes, there are tens of thousands of genes.    There are still many genes that science does not fully understand.Cerebral palsy can be a result of many different causes, but currently there is no "gene" test to identify its presence.     If your son's chromosome tests were normal, I wonder why they are testing other family members.	post_3257872

post_3247036	Aug 06, 2008	580130	580665	Abhilasha	I found this:Researchers showed that 2% of women started their fertile window by day four of their menstrual cycle, and 17% by day seven. Day one of the menstrual cycle is the day that menstruation begins. More than 70% of women were in their fertile window before day 10 or after day 17. Women who regarded their menstrual cycles as "regular" had a 1 to 6 percent probability of being fertile ***even on the day that their next period was expected to begin***	post_3241637

There are many cases of women having a menstrual cycle the month after conception -- and, in some rare cases, there have been women who have continued to menstruate regularly through most of their pregnancy.    Hope this helps.	post_3241637

I would reassure you that of yes course this child would be yours!Eureka254 is correct; menstruation, especially very early in a pregnancy, is not a sign that the egg has not been fertilized, and there have even been cases where women did not even know they were pregnant for many months because their cycles remained regular. Please stop worrying and be happy for yourself and your wife!	post_3241637

Newborn screening can provide parents with very important information, but it is exactly that:    screening.    Thalassemia trait has certain characteristics on blood screening, but conclusive diagnosis should be made through gene testing to be absolutely sure.If your baby truly 'has thalassemia minor,' it would mean either yourself OR your husband could also have the trait.    Fortunately, it should not impact your baby's overall health.    Because genetic testing and newborn screening has made many advances in recent years, it's quite possible that your older children were not screened, or perhaps if they were, that they are not carriers.    (If either you OR your husband were to be a carrier, the chance would be about 50% for a child to also be a carrier.)If your daughter indeed has the thalassemia trait, keep in mind that it is a "trait" that should do her health no harm.    When she grows up, the hope is that genetics understanding and its therapies will have made thalassemia major a concern only of our generation.    In future pregnancies, her chances of transmitting the trait to a child would also be 50%, as with anyone carrying a recessive trait.    If you find that you have many more questions, I'll certainly try to help, but you and your husband might benefit greatly from a consultation with a medical geneticist or genetic counselor.Health and happiness to you and your new baby!~eureka	post_3240292

We had 2 genetic disorder pregnancies. We terminated them because it was fetal disease.I am not sure there has any tests can help even DNA test may be 100% find out all the possibilites.

Your risk is low as assessed by the screening:    in other words, based on your age alone, your risk for having a baby with Down Syndrome was 1 in 130, just like all women 37 years old.    However, after looking at baby by ultrasound and evaluating the chemicals in your blood, your risk has been reduced to 1 in 3000.    So if we were to put 3000 women all in a room who had your results, only one of them would have a baby with down syndrome.The screening is exactly that:    screening.    It is not a definitive test.    The decision whether or not to have an amnio depends on your personal circumstances and where you are in life -- each woman is different.    If you feel you need to know for sure whether or not the baby has a chromosomal abnormality, amniocentesis gives a diagnosis, whereas the screening is an estimation of risk only.    Keep in mind that there is some risk (though small) with amniocentesis, and you also need to think about whether or not the information from an amniocentesis would benefit you and assist you in the management of the pregnancy.Best of luck to you!~eureka	post_3204206

One of the major problems is that of heart disease; the cholesterol can build up in the arteries of the heart (and other places) which will cause the arteries to lose their elasticity so they can no longer constrict/dilate to accomodate your needs. The cholesterol in these arteries starts to build up as plaque and can eventually completely block the artery, causing a heart attack. Signs and symptoms of this blockage occur only late into the disease, so once you have symptoms your arteries have already been significantly blocked.i hope that this answers some things for you!	post_3153700

She recommended I take folic acid so I just continued with my prenatal vitamins.    I did get pregnant a few months after my miscarriage in 2007 and I had my baby 5 weeks early (don't know if it was related with having early delivery), but my son is healthy.    However, I foolishly stopped taking my vitamins and now I am having problems with my circulation in my arms and legs, which I am currently getting looked at.    My doctor is giving me B12 injections and I am hopeful this will help.    Best wishes to you in the future and know that there is hope of getting pregnant again.	post_3095933

DNA mutation analysis for the common fragile x mutation is fairly available, and the test looks at the "number of repeats" on each allele, or any expansion of the fragile x gene on that part of the chromosomes to determine if you might be "a carrier."    Good luck.	post_3139825

The MTHFR gene (instruction) makes a specific protein/enzyme involved in metabolism.Usually the MTHFR test looks at the two copies of gene for changes (â  mutationsâ  ) that would cause that protein to not function properly.A person usually needs mutations of both copies of the gene to have higher homocysteine levels and/or medical problems.From your note it is unclear if you have one (â  heterozygousâ  ) or two (â  homozygousâ  ) of the C677T mutations.Some individuals are prescribed blood thinner if they have a history of blood clot, or a stroke or TIA/â  mini strokeâ   which was believed to be cause by small blood clots.

I can give you some advice (I don't have what you are referring to) first of all before you go write down a list of all your families medical history, like your parents and sibilings, your kids and your neices adn nephews and I would even include your grandparents even if they are pasesed on.. try to remember how ling they ahve had all of this. they are going to ask you for thier ages (this threw me off as I couldn't remember how old my dad was)    they are gong to ask you when your symptoms first appeared. What test you have doneSurgies and hospitalizatios also count for history.If you happen to have any of your medical records bring them with youI am pretty sure they will do bloodwork.they are also going to look you over and do a thourough exam on you.you ahve to wait for the results and then go from there.I am not sure if they will check out your little one on that day or not. they probablly want to do a check and confirmation on you first.Also if you are at a larger hospital, they might have someone come in and talk to you about helping out with research studies. they usually take just a wee bit more blood..I am sorry that I am not Dr. Kessler, but just trying to help out a little since I have been ther and know a little of what to expect.good luck and I pray that you guys are both going to be finemichelle	post_3054831

I have Ehlers Danlos type III (along with my other multitude of health issues)....The doctor did take some blood, but mostly he did a very thorough head to to assessment and went over my entire family tree, looking for any other family members that went undiagnosed with this. It took about a hour, the examination and questioning. He knew right off the bat that I had EDS III, I was classic for it he said because of my flexibility, joint pain, stretchy skin with all of the scars and odd striations as he put it. I also have a very high palate and am very near sighted, all common to EDS III he said. With type III, it usually won't show on a blood test from what I was told, but will have many physical manifestations.I hope that you finally get answers....I was finally diagnosed after many years of misdiagnosises, being called crazy or a malingerer, med seeker etc..and only because I happened to stumble on EDS info on the internet. I presented it to my doctor and the rest is history.Keeping you in my thoughts..Sunny	post_3054831

EDS affects the connective tissues -- the tissues that support various parts of the body such as skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments. In EDS, the fibrous protein collagen is faulty, causing the connective tissue to not be elastic or strong.What Are the Symptoms?There are 9 types of EDS and symptoms differ depending on the type of EDS. Type I and III have the following:* Skin problems, include fragile skin that bruises or tears; soft skin, and slow-healing wounds.* Joint problems, including loose, unstable joints; "double-jointed" or overextension of the joints; arthritis-like problems.Other types may have these symptoms:* Lung problems; weak blood vessels; eye problems; curvature of the spine; gum diseases; problems with blood clotting.How Is It Diagnosed?* A review of family and medical history.* Physical exam, checking for joint overextension.* Skin biopsy may be performed to study chemical makeup of connective tissue.Treatment Options* Diet - to reduce weight* Vitamin C* Exercise* Eye treatments* Joint protection* Protection from the sun* Surgery to correct fractures or dislocated jointsResources and Suggestions* Visit the Arthritis Store to request the free Arthritis Answers brochure.* Ehlers-Danlos National FoundationWe Also Suggest:* Consult your physician for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

If you do an internet search for 'paternity testing,' you will find several labs throughout the US that can test samples for you, but you need to contact them for the paperwork and a 'kit'. Some labs will also help you locate a clinic nearby to help you with getting the specimens.Some labs are independent:    that is, they'll send you the paperwork and the kit, but you have to find the provider to obtain the specimen.    If you are looking to do this prenatally, you may need to find a private doctor who does amniocentesis or a larger clinic/hopital for the amnio or chorionic villus sampling.    When you contact paternity labs directly, most of them are pretty helpful and forthcoming with information.Good luck.	post_2942342

They and their family m,embers talked about how they started to have trouble keeping score in tennis (when they were avid players for years), having trouble reading a map (when they were meticulous navigators all their adult life), having trouble using the computer, etc. for a few years before they were diagnosed.My mother had a form of dementia due to failure of her brain shunt for adult hydrocephalus. She began having trouble subtracting numbers (she never used a calculator in her life and always did math in her head), balancing a checkbook (she was a wiz at this normally); then she started having trouble getting my jokes and understanding regional slang expressions we used all the time. Eventually, she forgot how to tie her shoes.Cognitive symptoms can also include personality changes and poor judgement.	post_3310765
post_5699907	May 19, 2010	704281	597066	flor36	Cognitive symptoms include the ability to learn and remember and make judgments..    One example would be meeting a new person(s) in church and not being able to remember the name(s).    Taking a class and not remembering what it was about.    Forgetting appointments (memory losses).In the case of Alzheimers, it continues to decline and dressing, making decisions and other judgments become difficult.    I currently work with a man in his 10th yr. of Alzheimer's.    One day he can turn the walker in the right direction to sit in his recliner, but the next cannot and would sit on the walker or on the arm of the recliner or get confused over which direction to turn.    He uses his t-shirt as a towel when I start to help him put it on.    He will start in a direction but not be able to continue and say where do I go?    Language recall is very difficult as the decline continues.    Even swallowing is affected in the last stage.	post_3310765

My mom and I, after beating our heads into walls everytime the doc appointments rolled around realized that something HAD to be done or else he wouldn't get the care that he needed as he was completely unable to do so for himself...The only option, as far as asking about meds, having complete access to med records, documents, making decision etc. is getting power of attorney over your grandmother.    This gives you (or her, whomever chooses to take on the HUGE responsibility) to act on behalf of her.The process is relatively simple....but there's lots of paperwork and some legal fees involved.

Make sure there is a medical proxy in it (or a separate one, depending on state law) so you or whoever is appointed) can make medical decisions.Make sure who has it is reliable as they can do a lot of good, or they can drain the person's account's dry as they may/will have full access. The POA can be drawn up for certain transactions, or for everything, be prepared to answer questions.It may also help to get a living will at this time too, if she does not have one.	post_3612145

I started at Hyrdocodone prescribed for Wisdom tooth removal and got a taste for it from there.......This    being a drug that is prescribed a LOT nowadays....I think critics of research into marijuana's medicinal value should take a step back.    It's natural...grows in the earth.    And, if I thought for a minute that said research for AD was accurate I'd go get my dad some in a heartbeat.    But, for now I'll sit back and watch what unfolds with it.    I hope, be it THC or whatever they do find something to help in his lifetime....I pray everyday they do.	post_3696798

I had a friend who was in the nursing home that was fine one day and it was hot outside and when I went in to see him the next day they had him strip down to his underwear and a fan on him.    He was shaking so hard the bed was moving .    I called the aids in and told them that they should have watched him better.    He got sick with phyenomia that night and three days later was gone.    The elderly can't take much - lack of oxygen to the brain is not good.    Find out what the doctor ordered for amount of oxygen before he was found.    Did he have health care helper come in to help him at home or was it only his wife.    See about an artopsy/sp.    Bring up to the police after you get the answers and see what they think.    Did he have a life ins.    and did they have nursing home ins.    Nursing home will take half or more of all the money and assets with out nursing home ins..    rbcf	post_3712227

I can remember my Grandmother who most of my family say and have said for years, I am a "clone" of    - being eccentric.    I truly believe that she had BP - like me, and later in years, she had a severe case of Alzheimer's and was just in misery her last years.    I am comforted some by the fact that she wasn't diagnosed - and I was - so maybe the damage can be corrected.    Time will tell.Thanks so much.

post_3551317	Oct 20, 2008	244247	None	Umya	My grandmother had been in a state like you describe for a few years. When I visit her, she doesn't respond in any way to my presence, and she doesn't seem to notice what's around her. Her eyes are open, but otherwise she doesn't really seem conscious.A few weeks ago, she surprised everyone by speaking. She said to one of the nurses, "You help me every day." So that gives me the idea that even though she doesn't respond, she _is_ aware, at least sometimes--especially since she said "every day," which indicates that she has noticed this particular nurse, who takes care of her the most, many times.So I suspect there's more going on than we realize, even if we don't see any response.	post_3550501

I got the feeling he knew it was me but I understand that that may or may not be the case.    In any case, I do think he enjoyed the visit and I guess that is the main thing.    He has taken up this whistling behaviour where he just sits and purses his lips and whistles.    No tune or tone really.    It's curious.

He may leave the stove on after cooking and things of that nature.    Just be his friend.    He didnt ask for this condition.    He probably is confused as to why he keeps forgetting even though he knows he ha Demetia.    It sometimes makes the individual moody and depressed.    Alot of people with this dont wnt to shower or be clean.    He may be argumentative with you. just key in Dementia on Yahoo search and you will find alot of info.

post_3308841	Aug 21, 2008	144586	None	None	One of the biggest morale problems among caregivers is the problem of incontinence.In most cases, incontinence can be reduced or eliminated.My little sweetheart is now 103 and seven months. She was incontinent at age 100 and I ended that in five months. Six months ago she went into the hospital and was briefly in the hands of    "professionals" and the incontinence started again.    Right now she is no longer incontinent. She uses the toilet.The basic protocols are simple:(1) The patient must have the toilet in visual sight at all times. It should stay in the same place in the room and not be moved around.(2) If there is a chair they watch TV on, the toilet must be in view, so they can point to it. Failure to sit next to the patient should be a dismissable offense.(3) The aide MUST sit in sight of the patient 24/7. This way they can see them point to the toilet.(4) Toilet times are at exactly the saeme time every day. These times should be exactly THREE. No more and no less.(5) Suggested times are 9 A.M. 4 P.M. and 10 P.M., however these can be varied. The important thing is to be on the toilet at EXACTLY the same time. This rule can be altered when the patient is in deep sleep.(6) Before going to the toilet the patient is INFORMED of the time, verbally or with a dry-erase board. This sets the internal circadian clock.(7) Morning toilet is after getting up. Mid-day toilet is thirty minutes after a snack or small meal. Evening toilet is thirty minutes after a snack or small meal. Eating induces peristalic action approximately thirty minutes later.(8) Daily beverage should include four ounces or prune juice and two ounces of apple juice as stool softeners.	post_3308786
post_3308848	Aug 21, 2008	389974	None	None	Incontinence supplies should be tax deductible, as should OTC lotions and things that are needed for some people to live normally.	post_3308786
post_3310019	Aug 21, 2008	144586	None	None	Good idea, swampcritter.A few other things that help include EXERCISE. Without exercise normal paristaltic movement diminishes. I have a dislike for Hoyer Lifts and the readiness with which they are utilized. In order to exercise the patient must be dressed properly and not be in a night gown and a diaper. Thus my rule is normal dress upon awakening and no nightgown until night.    I also recommend a small amount of Metamucil every day. Not much. Too much causes constipation.	post_3308786
post_3315194	Aug 23, 2008	144586	None	None	Defecation is conditionable. Ideally, if the patient is ambulatory, the bathroom should be used. If an in-room toilet is used it should be in a corner of the room with a curtain or shield. With my little one I told the aides it is a dismissable offense for toilet to be performed with the door open. I installed a large "knocker" on the door for people to use. The human mind has the ability to measure time quite precisely. This internal clock needs to be reset, which is why you show the patient the time after each toilet. Excercise as much as possible is also important. I give my little camper Aptiva yogurt, which seems to help, but this is only an anecdotal observation.	post_3308786
post_3333085	Aug 27, 2008	144586	None	None	Avoidance of constipation and straining is important. There should be a soft rug around the tolet in the event of a period of unconsciousness and the aide should be in physical contact with the patient at all times. Do not have the aides encourage the patient to "push".Gentle massage of the tummy before a bowel movement and as much physical exercise as possible helps break up the feces. Soy products tend to produce constipation.A teaspoon a day of cod-liver oil and a teaspoon of extra-virgin oilive oil are helpful. The cod-liver oil now comes in flavored varieties.Straining causes activation of the vagus nerve near the rectal muscle, which drops the blood pressure and heart rate. That is why many people die on the toilet.This is termed a vasovagal fainting episode.The drill is to IMMEDIATELY lie the patient flat on his/her back, put a pillow under the shoulders to make sure the tongue does not occlude the trachea, open a window, and raise the legs seven to ten inches. If anything a simple pillow under them is better that nothing. Hold the patient's hand and provide reassurance    until the condition stabilizes. It will take twenty-thirty minutes for the heart rate to recover, but the patient should not stand up for an hour. Do not worry about feces on the floor.I am not going to tell you NOT to call 911, but this is generally unnecessary. The problem is the patient needs rest and you will end up with a siren run, blood draws, and probably seventeen hours in an emergency room. The exception is when the patient has a significant cardiac condition.Reduce this problem by a daily teaspoon of metamucil (not more), three-four ounces of prune juice, Ativa Yogurt, three-four ounces of apple juice. And of course ADEQUATE HYDRATION.	post_3308786
post_3368501	Sep 05, 2008	144586	None	None	I think you have some hreat suggestions, but in the military we learned never to give unenforceable orders. Restrictions on telephone calls fall within this category. As for regular hours, I have four girls working for me and I pretty much let them decide who works when.I would suggest a few more.1. caregiver must always sit in view of the person being cared for, preferably right next to them.2. Caregiver should go to police and request certificate of good conduct before permanent employment. These certificates are available from virtually every police department in the nation.3. Caregiver must log all telephone calls, with the name of the person who calls, the reason, and a call back.4. All visits by nurses or professionals must be logged in and out.5. Logbooks to remain in house.6. When caregiver is sick for any reason they will not report for work until notification and permission is granted. You don't need the flu in the room. Sick caregivers showing up for work have been a constant problem.7. Are not to give personal information on the telephone to anyone.8. On the job injuries to be reported PROMPTLY.9. Any time out of the room to be logged.10. Caregivers to report whenever supplies drop below a predetermined level. Gloves, etc.11. Any medical change in patient to be reported IMMEDIATELY to supervisor.	post_3363905
post_3494758	Oct 06, 2008	549322	None	None	Hi,Thanks for writing in.The symptoms of stroke depend upon the part of the brain involved and memory loss occurs due to loss of nerve cells in the brain.Brain damage due to stroke can lead to vascular dementia due to ischemia of the brain tissue.

post_3494816	Oct 06, 2008	549322	None	None	Hi,This happens in stroke when a person suddenly exhibits memory loss after talking normally. It all depends on the extent and location of brain damage.If you can shift your mother to a better facility it is definitely going to be good. It is important that her diabetes and BP are kept under control. The prognosis varies from person to person depending upon the general condition of the patient and extent of damage. Improvement is generally seen if the memory loss is not progressive.Hope this helps!	post_3494708

post_3436158	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	Mike	Hello MikeI live in England, UK, am 45 yrs old and both a CFS and EDS sufferer (I am not sure what you mean by ADS - especially as you typed it twice - is this a double typing error or a condition I have not heard of?!)I have suffered from CFS since 1990, and had the same very recognisable symptoms for all those years.    I still get it from time to time (like today - brain fog etc!) but the EDS symptoms are more prevalent now.Basically, my symptoms suddenly started changing around 5 yrs ago, and I was not sure what was happening to me.    My CFS symptoms had been so familiar to me over the years, that new pains such as those in the joints were a bit of a shock - I could not understand why something different seemed to be taking over.It took a lot of research on my part to find out what was wrong (I am 9/9 on the Beighton Hypermobility scale, but never considered there was anything wrong with me - just that I was very flexible!)    To cut a very very long story short, after numerous disc herniations, TMJ problems, excruciating foot pain, joint pain, fainting spells etc I worked out what was wrong, got a referral to Professor Rodney Grahame in London (one of the world's leading experts) and got a diagnosis.    I am classed as EDS Hypermobility type (formerly known as EDS type III).When you say your son has Ehler's Danlos Dyndrome, which type does he have?    There are several different types, the most benign of which (although no less painful!) being considered to be the Hypermobility type.    The most serious is the vascular type, which is extremely rare (but I have a relative being tested for it at the moment actually).For the purposes of this answer, I will assume your son suffers in the same way that I do (HEDS).    Hypermobility Type EDS (Type III) is considered by most in the medical profession to be equivalent to a condition known as 'Joint Hypermobility Syndrome'.    When I say 'most in the medical profession', you will be lucky to find anyone who can call themselves an expert in this field - there are very few.    Ehlers Danlos often goes unrecognised which is sad.    One reason for this is that medical students (in England anyway) are trained to look for REDUCED movement at joints as a cause of pain and not INCREASED movement.    (This clearly needs to be addressed in the future!)In the UK we are more advanced than other countries when it comes to research and expertise on these particular genetic disorders, so might I suggest you check out the websites of both the HMSA and the Ehlers Danlos Support Group (both based in England).    I have just returned from a weekend conference, which was most interesting (and 2 of the world's top Professors    - Prof Grahame and Prof Bird contributed).    If you check out the message boards, you will be able to chat to us all and ask more questions.Now, back to your son.    I find that the exercise/activity related fatigue is directly related to my CFS.    I can almost time it without a watch that my flu like symptoms will appear 24 hrs after exercise.    I can find no such link with the intermittent fatigue I get from the EDS, although I notice that my suffering with the EDS is somewhat affected by hormones.I am not able to advise you on the genetics linking CFS and EDS, however I can tell you from the contact I have with other EDS sufferers that these 2 conditions often go hand in hand (Fibromyalgia being another condition that seems to link in).From my own case, I can tell the 2 apart, as symptoms are very different.    I can understand though that for someone apparently suffering from both at once that it could be very confusing indeed.    I had about 10-15 years experience of having CFS on its own, so can see the difference!Some people believe that CFS is actually one and the same as EDS but I don't buy this -I know a lot of people with CFS who clearly are not EDS sufferers.    I believe that something in the brainstem area at the top of the neck could be one area that affects both sets of symptoms but I am not medically trained!    This area does control the autonomic nervous system though, so it would explain poor temperature control, low blood pressure and other weird symptoms.    Some EDS sufferers have been found to have what is known as a 'Chiari Malformation' (see Chiari Institute website) which causes brainstem related symptoms.    (I have never had a brain scan, so don't know if my brain stem has 'settled'!)I wish I could help you on the medication question.    For my CFS the only thing I've found that helps is NADH (which can be bought online - I buy mine from the Nutri Centre).    Actually, VegEPA has also been a great help.    I must start taking it again!The EDS being newer to me is not something I have conquered yet, but the main message which came out of this weekend's conference was that exercise is key to coping with Hypermobility Syndrome and helping stop the decline in mobility etc (NB!    This will only apply if your son has Hypermobility Type EDS which is the same thing really).Your son will have the same issues as me - by exercising to manage his EDS, he may well suffer the after effects through a relapse of the CFS. It is a nightmare.    The only exercise I would recommend is Pilates.    I won't go into the reasons in full, but basically it is because in Hypermobility sufferers, often the big muscles are being worked at the expense of the smaller ones.    Any exercise that therefore works on STABILITY is key.    Pilates, Alexander Technique, T'ai Chi etc.    (For me, anything more would be impossible anyway with the CFS!)I hope this helps you!    Please note I am a fellow sufferer, not a medical professional, so I am simply telling you things as I see them, and from my own experience.Good luck!    Information is key...as Professor G said at the conference "Take charge of this illness or it will take charge of you!"	post_3412073
post_5028746	Oct 30, 2009	1091448	None	jawsuk	hi i have a daughter who was diagnosed with cfs 12 months ago and reffered for possible eds. We have recently received the diagnosis fro eds hypermobility type. my problem is that now i have this, the doctor is trying to say that she no longer has a diagnois for cfs. i don't know where this assumption comes from, as all the same problems are still there, although now they are better managed due to a time management system given to us by the cfs specialist.Just wondered if you could get in touch so i could pick your brains as regards how i show the link between the two, as i'm now being accused of creating facticious illnesses and may yet face prosecution for refusing to allow mt child to attend full time school	post_3412073
post_5034896	Nov 01, 2009	607015	None	Jaymcc	Hi there!Are you based in the US?Sorry to hear about the problems you are experiencing.    I have two thoughts (I'm just a sufferer of these 2 conditions rather than a medical expert, so I hope this helps):1.    Your child is clearly suffering WHICHEVER the diagnosis.    If you can only get an official diagnosis of "EDS including symptoms of Chronic Fatigue" then this should be good evidence to present to the authorities investigating you, as they indicate the level of suffering!Either your daughter is well enough to attend school or not, and either one of these debilitating conditions alone might be sufficient to explain your reasons for her absenteeism.    A diagnosis of EDS is serious enough on its own! I expect from what you say (and from my own experience) that your daughter is indeed suffering from both cfs and eds together, as they often go hand in hand.    I know only too well how real but frustratingly 'invisible' these two conditions can be, so it is important that an expert can write a letter explaining the debilitating symptoms and their impact.    I would recommend going to the HMSA (Hypermobility Syndrome Association based in the UK) website and printing off the introductory letter (from memory I think it is on the home page and is written by world expert Professor Rodney Grahame). This open letter explains clearly how debilitating this condition is.If you have an official diagnosis of eds, the specialist who diagnosed should know about the link between these 2 conditions and be able to confirm it.    Experts are still unsure WHY there is a link between EDS and CFS, and which came first.    In my case I suffered from cfs for decades before the eds, but was clearly born with the EDS - it was just a matter of years before the symptoms became evident.    Fibromyalgia is another linked condition (and FM is often confused with CFS).    Some 'schools of thought' now believe that Fibromyalgia is one and the same as Hypermobility syndrome (personally I remain unconvinced).I don't know the ins and outs of your personal situation (the law, the education system etc) but I feel it    would be appropriate to get a letter from the specialist (i.e. a rheumatologist or I suppose a geneticist), diagnosing the EDS and also commenting that symptoms of associated CFS have been evident for 12 months.    Whether the diagnosis is one of official 'CFS', or 'EDS with associated chronic fatigue' the symptoms are equally debilitating.2. Depending on which definition of CFS you look at, the presence of other conditions sometimes means that    a diagnosis of CFS is not possible as a stand alone illness.    (For example, I remember reading recently that people who suffer from bipolar disorder for cannot get a diagnosis of 'CFS').    However, it is usually a case of ticking symptoms off on a list and if you relate to more than a certain number of symptoms, a CFS diagnosis is made.Very recently, a new human retro virus called HMRV was discovered in a research study (in the US) of CFS patients.    95% of CFS patients tested positive for it, which has been a revelation.    It will soon be possible to be blood tested for this HMRV retrovirus, which should prove very enlightening.    In the case of myself, your daughter and others with CFS and EDS together, researchers should be able to confirm through a blood test whether this retrovirus is present (and if so, I cannot see how a diagnosis of CFS could be denied).    This could prove extremely helpful to you, as it would be one very measurable, tangible 'sign' of severe illness.    I believe that testing is already being made available in the US (but it probably costs a few hundred dollars!)    Here in the UK things may become available on a much slower basis!I hope this helps you and wish you the very best of luck.    Do write back to let us know how you get on.	post_3412073
post_5361304	Feb 10, 2010	1206594	None	EDS Sufferers in U.S.	To be perfectly honest - which is not something many medical professionals will do in a face to face visit, Chronic Fatigue is associated w/ Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) for several reasons - the primary reason for most b/c of the constant effort your body has to expend in compensating for what it lacks - which is mainly holding that body (that is literally falling apart) together.    Pain is the other reason -    both are absolutely draining on an individual.What many people fail to address is the fact that we EDSers have bodies that do not function the same as others in the 'general population.    Our bodies are quite literally 'falling apart at the seams' w/ an already large deficiency in connective tissue strength that is continually degrading with time.    I am a 44 yr old woman now (surprised I made it this far) & can attest to the fact that our bodies are literally falling apart - more so as we grow older.    We have to build up our muscle mass/ strength to compensate for remaining connective tissue that fails to do its job properly in keeping our joints in place.    When we lack or lose that muscle strength, havoc ensues with the continual effort and strain to hold those joints together - which is incredibly draining, whether you realize it or not.    I can remember when I was a child, asking the dr why my neck continually caused me such unexplainable pain - he replied by telling me that a person's head weighs as much as a bowling ball & to imagine going about my day trying to hold that bowling ball w/out dropping it.    He said that this is exactly what my neck is going through every minute of the day & that it would only make sense thatI (w/ EDS) would have such pain as I did.While I have seen too many articles online about this disease, one thing I've noticed is that they don't really give people a full undestanding of what this disease is about - in laymen's terms.    What they really fail to state is that EDS is a disease in which the collagen in your body is in an already weakend state, and deteriorates more and more over time.    What many people fail to understand is that every prson's body is comprised of at least 80% collagen -    it is not only your 'skin' that is comprised of collagen.    Collagen comprises or is a main factor in connective tissue - ligaments, tendons, even muscle.    It is a key factor even in cell structure - forming the walls of the cell, as well as being found within the cell. Collagen is what all your organs, joints, arteries, etc. are made of, even your eyes are comprised of collagen.    Your brain, your bone marrow . . .     just about anything you can name in your body is somehow either comprised of or has as a main component, collagen.Now, if you stop to think about it in that light, you tend to come up with a slightly different picture as to what is going on w/ a person that has EDS - regardless of their 'type'.    Then there is the issue of addressing which 'type' you have ben diagnosed with . . .     and what those doctors mostly fail to recognize is that most all EDSers have cross-type manifestations.    We are all different (yet the same) as each other - and each individual EDSer has their own 'things' thataffects them more or less than another EDSer.    We are unique to ourselves. . . .     researchers are just starting to realize what we have always known (yet, they always failed to listen to).For me, living w/ EDS for 44 yrs, I have more problems than most b/c things just can't be bad enough - they have to get worse.    What has happened to me, is something that hasn't been found in any other (or so I've been told by the world-reknowned geneticist that recomfirmed my Dx).    W/ my classical 'type', my spine has decided to completely go south on me - just before I turned 40, leaving permanently disabled for the rest of my life w/ such advanced degenerative spine disease *NOTE* that is INOPERABLE only b/c I have EDS.    What would otherwise be emergency surgery for any other person in this world, there is no doctor that exists that can (or will) even attempt to help me.    I have lost any & all quality of life that I once had by another degenrative disease that isn't supposed to be common to us.    I can no longer do anything much for myself & have been told that I require a FULL spinal fusion = from my neck to my derier.    Without that surgery, I have been told that I will end up like a 'rag doll', similar to that of a person in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy.    It's a shame that they didn't tell me what I'll do about when that wheelchair comes, b/c I have lost my ability to even 'sit' & am forever stuck lying down.    Standing for more than 5 minutes hasits own issues too, then there's the Cauda Equina that developed from my spine being medically neglected - so I am completely incontinent for the rest of my life - which btw, they don't tell you leads to permanent paralysis.I certainly don't mean to scare anyone, as much as I mean to tell you the honest truth of what 'could' happen from this disease.    You all need to take every precaution to 'baby' your body with every opportunity you have b/c it's anybody's guess what your form will develop later on down the road.I can also tell you that here in the U.S., you had better hope to God that you never end up on Medicare either.    They, like almost every doctor I have met, will descriminate against you simply b/c you have a disease that is not common to the 'normal' people in the general public.    They will not cover any treatment (of symptoms = only treatment available), if it is not 'common'.    You should also be prepared for the fact that there are NO medical professionals that are experts on this disease (other than the geneticist that diagnose it), and in today's day, there are absolutely NO doctors that either know/ heard of your disease without looking it up on the internet 5 min before you walk in the door, and NO doctors that will treat you/ even take you as a patient b/c of the complexity of your disease, and mostly b/c you are not 'cost efficient' enough for them to spend any time on a untreatable/ incurable case.        I live in CT, on the border of NY . . .     I cannot tell you how many doctors over the years, that I have seen (and ultimately refused treatment/ or to accept me as a patient), even before my spine went.    I had ONE doctor when I was 14 that diagnosed me and ONE doctor that reconfirmed that Dx.    Since that 1st doctor, it has been over 20 yrs that I have been searching throughout the entire Country trying to find just one drl to accept me as a patient & even longer since my spine decided to quit.    I have had dr.s admist that my case takes up too much of their time & they have many more patients w/ 'textbook' cases that they can turnover at a higher rate & just couldn't take the responsibility or time to deal w/ mine.    I have had major medical institutions tell e tht they just didn't know what to do w/ me -     so there was no reason for me to be a patient there.    I needed someone to think outside of the box, yet no one will take the 'risk' involved w/ someone like me (w/ EDS).    So I am swept under the rug, w/ handfuls of painkilllers, left to watch my body literally falling apart w/ absolutely nothing to do about it.It truly is a shame to live in a Country that prides itselfon such cutting edge medical technology, yet are very descriminatory toward people they are supposed to be looking over us.    It's a shame when the only people in this world that we have to turn to for help, turn us away for no other reasonSo be prepared	post_3412073

post_4824808	Aug 31, 2009	1023532	None	Christine	I had an unsucessful implantation of three embryos with no answer of why from my IVF Md since everything else in the process was successfull.    I came across the book "Is Your Body Baby Friendly" by world renowned reproductive immunology specialist Dr. Alan E. Beer.    The book speaks to women who have had problems conceiving, miscarriages one or more etc .and how through immunology testing problems can be prevented once you know what is going on with the body and treat it.    Needless to say Dr. Beer is deceased but the book provides reference of other physicians who specialize in the field one in particular who study with Dr. Beer is Dr. Joanne Kwak Kim of Rosalind Franklin University Reproductive Medicine Center.    Long story short I went to Dr. Kim and I as you, found out that I have a positive MTHFR C677 mutation.    Such people with this mutation are at risk for atherosclerosis and thromboembolism, pregnancy wastage ( misscarriages), implantation failure( me), fetal neural tube defect, uteroplacental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction and placental infarction.    Dr. Kwak Kim has placed me on a regimen to fight this before my next go at a transfer.    Basically not enough blood flow gets to the fetus.    hope this helps.Tina	post_3332826

He also wont prescribe me the blood thinners. Last couple days I have been taking 2 low dose baby aspirin plus Rovin for folic and iron, and vit D, and Omega 3. I haven't been to the doctor yet but I believe I am about 4 weeks along. I am also C677T heterozygous I think, (    it might be homo) for MTHFR.I'm 37 and I expect to miscarry in Jan. I just haven't had any luck with having even one child. I haven't ever been pregnant long enough to hear a heartbeat. I always miscarry btw 6 and 8 wks.I have noticed that 2 of my m/c happened during or close to running on the treadmill. MTHFR cases that I have read mentioned implantation problems, I guess no jogging/high impact exercise then.I have noticed that a lot of MThfr women have healthy babies so I haven't completly given up hope.This stuff is so sad. Moms don't know how lucky they are to have a healthy child/pregnancy the first go-round. I don't think there is much you can do but be patient and hope, and don't be too hard on yourself when it doesn't happen. Also, you hubbys/partners out there? Please be accepting of this.

I have a group here on MH that I specifically created for MTHFR.    I too have the same variant (C677T) and also suffered three miscarriages this year.    I am now treated properly for the MTHFR (something that is very hard to do I learned) and am now currently and successfully 16 weeks pregnant.There is a ton of information that I have posted regarding this genetic variant simply because it is not well known - or rather is known but has much debate surrounding it's treatment.    Please take the time to look at the group forum I put together on this very topic - MTHFR (and recurrent pregnancy loss) and hopefully you can take some of the information that I have listed and put together back to your doctor or find a specialist who deals with MTHFR as I have had to do.    Also you will find many others in this group who you can ask or chat with who have gone through or are currently going through what you and I have.http://www.medhelp.org/forums/MTHFR-Methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase/show/961?camp=mscPlease also do not hesitate to message me directly.    I have much information that I can share with you or anyone else who is just learning about this Variant.    If you can get tested for it and also on a treatment regimen, it can change your life with respect to trying to conceive and staying pregnant.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_3332826

My hematologist said that since I am homozygous I am "a ticking time bomb" that could go off at any moment. I have two healthy boys that are 3 1/2 years apart. Don't think I ever had a m/c, however, my menstrual cycles are awful. You could have a blood clot in your finger. It is probably rare, however, my father had a blood clot in his spleen. I would find a good hematologist to go to. Your blood also may be really thick and the aspirin is just not cutting it. Hope this helps!	post_3636394

You could chance asking your doctor when you visit the next time, but as a minor you have limited rights as to your health charts. I would think why not, it is your body and you have the right to know.You may have a gender disorder self diagnosed by how you feel.    I have been in contact with many who were raise a girl knowing they were male and visa versa.There is only one way I know how to find out and you are too young to get a Karyotype blood test ( a blood test that determines sex) but this is very expensive test if not covered by insurance < $900.00.	post_3715489
post_3798804	Dec 22, 2008	715883	697343	jj110	Um I was wrong in the above message. You are not to young to get a sex chromosomes test. You can ask but it will have to be approved by your parents since their insurance will pay for it if it does.	post_3715489
post_5329580	Feb 01, 2010	1193370	697343	jj110	jj110, I have just joined this forum with similar issues to you, although I am a lot older. I have done lots of research on the internet over the years trying to find my own answers as I have been estranged from my family most of my life, and am not given straight answers when I do question.I think it is reasonable to question things. I believed things I have been told, and find out now how untrue they have been. How you feel IS important, and with courage and persistence you will find your answers I trust.In Australia, we are entitled to our medical records at age 18, and you are lucky you are posing these questions in a time where you will find support and people like you and unlike you who understand. I think it is key to keep asking questions until things "sit well with you". Information is so much easier to get hold of with the internet, and making contact with people who can support you is also available too.Unfortunately for me, my medical records have been destroyed, and all I have is physical and psychological scars I am still trying to work with to find my truth.There are many cases of many different conditions which blur the boundaries of M and F. It seems to me like a jigsaw puzzle. Gender, and gender identity, and sexual orientation, and sexual preference, are all different things and are all personal and unique to each individual.Are you able to have any discussion with your sister, just to use it as a fact finding discussion to see what she thinks she knows, maybe bring up the conversation indirectly.    She may not in fact know too much, or she may have interpreted it incorrectly, but asking questions is a start.In the short term it is not normal to be in that much pain due to menstruation. You need to consult a doctor about pain management, and to establish what is the cause of this pain. Can you tell your mother about the pain and ask her next time to get you to a Dr so she/he can assist you. There must be something that can be done in the short time to make your periods more manageable, and then you can deal with your other issues, bit by bit, as you question and learn.I hope you get to read this, and hope that between the time you wrote your letter and now, that you are feeling better, and are finding out things you need to know.Keep in touch.	post_3715489

post_5017365	Oct 27, 2009	1087706	None	AidansMommy416, momaleksandar, ttatina	Hi Everyone,My son had Rett Syndrome (RS) but it was not until he passed away that we found out.    Scientists and researchers actually wrote a scientific paper, published in a medical publication last year.    My son and his condition was the basis of the study, and in it the researchers discovered that my son had a new form of mutation of the RS disorder; after their discovery of this mutation 17 more children, both boys and girls, had a similar mutation.    I joined the International Rett Syndrom(syndrome)Foundation, and their website is www.rettsyndrome.org.    You can find information about RS, and join the community to share thoughts, ideas, and concerns with other parents who are going through the same (or similar) situations as you.    I hope this helps.    If you want to find out more about my son, including what symptoms he showed prior to his passing (he passed away at 16 months) feel free to ask.    Have a good one.	post_3471289

post_3444086	Sep 23, 2008	419309	502258	mikku	I'm very sorry for you and your wife's losses.    It is not unusual for women to miscarry a first and sometimes a second pregnancy.    There are many possible reasons why a woman may miscarry, but the chromosomal karyotype inv(9)(p11:q12) is NOT considered a contributing cause for miscarriage by genetic specialists.    It is indeed a common variation, and many parents with this inversion have happy and healthy babies.    I hope that is the case for you and your wife in the future.Your wife may benefit from a full work-up by a High-Risk perinatologist to check for other possible factors or underlying causes that can increase risk for miscarriages.    Best of luck to you and your wife.~eureka	post_3400725

post_3874919	Jan 14, 2009	736302	648003	gawani	My heart and prayers go out to you and your family.    But I was wondering more about your post.    Who is the he that has a blanced translocation of 13& 14?    Only because a balnced translocation is not an issue for the person with it..only for when they go to reproduce.    Trisomy 13 on teh other hand is most often not compatiable with life but there is a website called living with trisomy 13 that shows many people who are indeed able to sustain life but the quality and severity varies for each.And I was concerned for the children you do have when you and your spouse declined the genetic testing.    If you are or if your hubby has a balanced trans therefore you are a carrier.... then this would tell you whether or not to test your other children.    I can tell you that it may be important to them to know this as soon as they are able to understand reproduction.I speak as a mom who learned after 2 m/c that I had a balanced translocation and that my hubby was genetically normal.    I went on to have a wonderful 3rd pregnancy and that child was tested and in a way beat the odds as my child is also genetically perfect.    But what i know is that I will continue to have miscarriages, I too have the risk of carrying to term a trisomy or losing that baby along the way... but most importantly i know that i will have all of my children tested so that i can tell them the truth about themselves when the time comes.    I know this because I shared this information with a sibling.    And they too have the same translocation.    And they & their spouse are grateful to know, especially since they were not naive about increased miscarriage rate and they were better prepared when they lost their first pregnacy.    It is a struggle but it is one to be better aware of than not.    I do hope you reconsider testing your children that you feel are fine should the test for you and your husband reveal anything.    And may this genetically abnormal baby have been blessed to have been cared for by you even if the time was short.    God Bless you and yours.Gracie	post_3518624

post_3436221	Sep 22, 2008	607015	None	Young Wife	I have EDS, and am seeing a neurologist soon for various reasons (I believe I have a Chiari malformation actually - recent research has shown that there are strong links between the 2 conditions as you have discovererd).Please see the reply I have posted today to 'Mike' about Ehlers Danlos and the information therein.Yes, I believe you should get her tested for EDS as it sounds like a distinct possibility.    I am type III myself (Hypermobility type) and am 9/9 on the scale.Can your daughter bend her thumb back to touch the underside of her arm?Can she (without bending her knees) put her palms on the floor?Do her knees go slightly backwards, not exactly in a vertical line when she stands straight with both feet together?When her arms are out straight, do these appear to extend back slightly too?    (i.e. they are not in a straight line?)These are the tests that will be done on her (see the UK website for the HMSA for further details) but your daughter might also have very loose ankles, toes that bend back further than they should, thumbs that bend right back etc.    These are not on the official diagnostic test, but are also indicative!Talk to others via the British websites for the HMSA and Ehlers Danlos Support Group in order to meet other sufferers based in your area (the bloggers are from all over the world).    Hopefully they will give you names of KNOWLEDGEABLE doctors!    Most know very little about EDS unfortunately, but the situation is gradually improving.Is your daughter having an operation on her Chiari Malformation?    Have you been to NYC to the Chiari Institute?    I understand that Paulo Bolognese is the leading expert - has she seen him?    Unfortunately we don't have anyone like him in the UK (to my knowledge anyway) so if I do have an MRI showing a C1 malformation, I'm not sure what I will do!Good luck!	post_3373282

She does have some of the things that you described.    Her most bothersome symptom is shoulder pain.    She is trying some stenghtening excersises to try to help it, but they are only mildly helping.I appreciate that you took time out to answer some of my questions!	post_3373282

(Headaches, blackouts etc?)    Did she have to try 'hanging on a springy thing off the back of a door' first (to see if some of the symptoms went away)?

post_3585808	Oct 28, 2008	570413	664281	LauraRed	I believe that Dr. Clair Francomano    in  Maryland is one of the leading geneticist for EDS.    A friend of mine traveled from Alabama to see her, and loved her.    From what I have been told, she has worked with the doctors at TCI.HTH!	post_3373282
post_3585840	Oct 28, 2008	570413	607015	jawsUK	Hi!    I am sorry that it has taken me so long to reply, but I just saw your questions.Rachael's symptoms before surgery were numerous.    Headaches (daily, constant), dizziness, ringing in her hears, neck pain, back pain, nausea, balance problems, vision problems, and numbness and tingling in various areas.The Chiari expert that we saw did not recommend the "over-the-door contraption".    He knew what she needed and that she needed to be decompressed.    He was very conservative in what he removed, thankfully.She has not been diagnosed with EDS.    She has been diagnosed with joint laxity.    After her surgery, she is much better, but still has Chiari to live with on a daily basis.     At times, her shoulder pain is her main symptom, and at others it's her head.    But, we just take it a day at a time.	post_3373282

Sharing A+ blood doesn't need any special care.It is not unusual for women to miscarry in early pregnancy for a variety of reasons.    If you have had repeated unexplained pregnancy losses (of 3 or more), you might benefit from genetic testing or consultation with a high-risk obstetrician.Best of luck.~eureka	post_3693592

post_3691626	Nov 22, 2008	691188	None	Shannon Wooten	Hi I had a Pheo tumor while I was pregnant as well.    That was 7 years ago.    Was your Mother under the care of a Dr when she was discovered to have the Pheo?    The reason I ask is that most of the time the cure is to find and get the tumor out asap.    Now, sometimes the tumor can be as small as a few cells big and won't show up on all the tests and scans that are used to find the little buggers.I did say that the cure for a pheo is an operation.    But for some the story is not over.    Pheochromocytoma is genetic in some cases.    I think that more and more the "experts" are looking like maybe all pheo tumors are genetic.    With that information if I were you I would go to one of the smartest places on the www (in addition to here) and go to a site called Pheochromocytoma Support on Yuku.    You will know you are there when you see what is called the "Blackboard" .    Go read the Welcome area and go learn about the different types of syndromes that can have pheochromocytoma as a component.    Go learn about how to get your self and other family members tested.    Sometimes you can even get into a study and you can get a lot paid for for letting them study you.I would start with an Endocrinologist and a geneticist to get yourself cleared.Go look at all the information on vhl, mens, and the different types of syndromes.    Several others in my family had tumors as well as me but I was the first that had a diagnosed Pheo tumor.    These tumors maybe related.     I have yet to get my genetic testing, but I look a lot like a vhl syndrome survivor.    I just learn all about the syndromes and watch my child and others in our family (my sibs) to see that they are not loking like I was.    Make yourself real familiar with the symptoms so you can spot it.    That is our defense.    Your Mom would be proud of you that you are looking into this.    Even if you end up having one of the genetic makeups to grow a Pheo, it does not mean you will ever have one.    Get tested.    Then you will know if you or your children (now and future) will ever have to look hard for tumors and will know where (what type, vhl, mens, one of the syndromes).Now, I do worry about my child that they may carry the genes for one of the syndromes that can grow a pheo tumor.    If you go read it will say the these tumors are sporadic, but I think the concensus more and more leans toward them all being genetic.    They are so rare that no one knows what these other syndromes look like.There is an entire field opening up which looks at what happens to us when we are invitro (in our momma's belly).    Definite links have been made between what happens to us there and the illnesses and diseases we develop later in life.    Look up Holland and World War II and maybe heart disease or diabetes.    I think that there is where researchers started to see a link between our lives invitro and later.I feel bad that I was pregnant for my child while I had my tumor.    It was so hard.    I feel for your Mom.    She must have really wanted you!    Did she know she had the tumor before she become pregnant?    Most I believe would be advised to not become pregnant.    Or, did the Doctors tell her about how long she may have had the tumor (which would have been a few years before conceiving you) in retrospect?    Was she on bed rest the entire time?    I was.    I tell my kid he is a champ for surviving all that and was meant to be here.    We give high fives to each other for surviving that together!    You are a champ too for making it!I brreast fed my child.    I worry about the adrenaline/ noradrenaline breast milk I must have been giving him and what that must have been doing to his little developing brain.    I did not know I had the tumor until he was three.    If I would not have gone to a good hospital (a research hospital the the National Instututes for Health or a University hospital) to have my tumor I would have not made it.    In recent years Doctors at the NIH and the big University affiliated hospitals have gotten real good at getting these tumors out with very few dying in the operation.    Good news for me.    The larger the tumor the worse your chances of survival in an operation I think.I hope I helped.    I am not an expert (MD) or anything.    Just had to learn this since it was my fate.    Go check out Pheochromocytoma Support on Yuku.    We can help you with so much more in the way of details over there.    And there are a bunch of us over there to help since this is so rare.    Take care, Joele	post_3659960
post_3694203	Nov 23, 2008	192055	691188	Joele	Wow, thank you so much for this very informative response!!You know, I am not too sure if she was under a dr's care when she discovered that she had pheo. Honestly, I am not even too sure how it call came about...finding out and all. My Grandmother talks about her a lot but it is hard for me to talk about her or ask about her. How did you find out that you had a pheo?I think I have seen the support forums before, the blackboard. I think I posted something a year or two ago... then forgot about the site. I am going to have to get back to the site!I do plan on seeing a genetics counselor and getting tested and such. I am moving in January so I am going to contact a doctor when I get to Tx. Tx seems like it has some good hospitals so that is reassuring.I really don't know if she knew that she had the tumor for 4 years. I know that she had the tumor 2 years prior to having me and then passed 2 years after having me. I am not sure how long she knew that she had the tumor. I think her tumor sat on top of her kidneys as well, though I am not 100% sure.That is great that you and your son openly discuss it and make it so positive! It is def something to celebrate!Thank you so much for the support and information... i really appreciate it!!!How did the docs diagnose you? I told my urologist that my mother had Pheo.. and the blood tests that he is running is to check for cancerous cells. Would that show anything if pheo was in the picture. Lets def hope not... but I am interested if it would show up in a blood test.	post_3659960
post_3531916	Oct 14, 2008	419309	639815	forlifemom	The 92% "accuracy rate" refers the sensitivity of the Integrated Screening.    It means that in routine screening, 92% of the women who are carrying a baby with Down Syndrome will have a positive Integrated Screen result (most screens in the 2nd trimester are considered positive risk if risk is greater than 1 in 270).    On the flip side, it also means that 8% of the women who are carrying a baby with Down syndrome will have a negative risk assessment.The ratio used in interpreting risk is the result of a mathematical calculation of data and statistics, comparing your blood markers to the frequency rates of Down Syndrome and the data of thousands of pregnancies.    Because Integrated Screening is not diagnostic, it will always be measured as a "ratio" of risk -- in percentages -- and age is part of that calculation.    Although older women are more likely to have a positive screen, many have results that show negative risk and go on to have normal pregnancies.Do keep in mind that screening may cause worry for some women and indeed have no value.    What should be driving your decision whether or not to "screen" is to think about if and how the information will impact the management of your pregnancy.    Curiosity is not a good incentive to pursue screening or testing; it's important that you choose only those tests and options that best benefit your personal situation.    I hope this helps.~eureka	post_3486328
post_3636829	Nov 09, 2008	675248	None	None	I am 19 1/2 weeks pregnant and 39 yrs old. I wish I had not taken the quad screen tests. My doctor told me it would more than likely come back positive due to my age and it did and now I am worried, and upset. My risk factor came back 1/10 chance of having my baby having down syndrome. I will not do the amnio because I will not terminate and it is not worth the risk to the baby - even though it would be peace of mind or devistation for me.    I had a level II u/s and genetic counseling. The dr tried to tell me look at the flip side, I have a 90% chance of the baby being normal. Well a 1/10 risk is not good. My age risk alone was 1/88.    Just rememberr all it is, is a risk factor screen not a diagnostic test. Thats what I try to keep remembering.	post_3486328

Your son having blood type O does NOT indicate non-paternity. In other words, you and your wife, though both blood type A, a dominant trait, may both carry a gene for O blood type.

post_3521322	Oct 12, 2008	648003	None	None	i am 32 weeks pregnant with a trisomy 13 baby. there is a chance that he could be born alive. when i found out it was already passed the time i could have legally terminated the pregnancy with a doctor. but, doesn't matter. even though this is the hardest thing that i have ever had to go through i just hold on to the testimonials of people who were so happy that they did not abort and got to hold and see their baby. even though this is the scariest thing for me to imagine enjoying. it seems that no one regrets letting things happen naturally but people who terminate seem to have regrets. i just don't want to add a regret to my already hard situation. and, even though he will not be able to survive on his own in this world he is not in pain in my belly. i will not allow anyone either to give him pain or stick him with needles or tubes. he will either pass on his own in my belly or in my arms and no one else's. i can't believe i have lived with knowing something is terribly wrong with my baby now for 10 weeks. 10 HARD weeks! i don't know what is going to happen in the future either...the labor...seeing him...mourning...trying again? there is just so much for me to still go through. just know you are not alone as i do know this too and am thankful there is a handful of people that i would never have to explain these emotions to. just know that i know how hard it is too. and i hate that we have to live through this. have you listened to the song "Held" by Natalie Grant? i did last night and it just made me cry and feel better all at the same time. lots of tears these days. almost everyday. but, that is just going to have to be okay for now.	post_3365228

What may or may not be acceptable, morally or otherwise, will be impacted largely by your own views as well as those of your family and friends and the society in which you live.If your question about genetics is in regards to having children together, there indeed may be an increased risk above that of population risk for your children to have a birth defect if you and your partner share grandfathers.    If you have concerns in that regard it might benefit you to seek consultation with genetic counselors/specialists.Best wishes,~eureka	post_3577733

post_3549520	Oct 19, 2008	648003	651011	emeralda	i am not a professional but i have very real personal experience that i am living right now. the ultrasound you will be getting will be looking for soft markers. soft markers are defects that they can for sure pick up with the ultrasound technology. soft markers also can point to a genetic disorder. this is what happened to me at my 23 wk ultrasound. they saw that my baby had what is called an omphalacele in which a little bit of the intestines are protruding into the umbilical cord. then they also saw that my baby had and extra finger on each hand and extra toe on each foot. these were the soft markers they found that can point to a genetic problem. they then said that i could have a amnio done to confirm what they were expecting from what they found on the ultrasound. they said that they thought it could be a trisomy 18 baby and he would not live longer than a week if born alive at all. i didn't want the amnio done at first because i didn't see any good reason for it at the time but then i decided to get it done because i wanted to make the decision in which way i would want to deliver my baby if something were very wrong with him. i would want to have a vag birth if he did have something wrong with him and he wasn't expected to live long because that is just best for my body and i would have a c-section if only he had a belly problem and a vag birth could cause him stress. so, i decided to get the amnio done. i was very scared. but, it was the easiest thing to get done! i didn't look ofcourse at the needle but it is much smaller than the kind of needle they use to take your blood. it is like a needle that looks like a hair. i hardly felt a pinch. it was so easy. only slight crampy feeling that lasted maybe a total of 15 min afterwards and it was not bad at all. my amnio did come back with the information that my baby does have trisomy 13 and will not live long outside of my body. the amnio and the ultrasound put together kinda confirm each other. I was told by my doctor that there was a 1/500 chance of something going wrong in the amnio.so, i have decided on the vaginal birth because that is what would be best for my body in having another baby. abortions i don't know what that risk is on your body because it is something that was not an option for me since the cut off point is 23 wks with doctors in the state of michigan and i just can't do a D & E the procedure itself is just not inviting to me where as i can see having a baby either alive or asleep naturally. i am now 33 wks pregnant and have been living with knowing all of these details of my pregnancy for 10wks and counting. my family does not have a history of birth defects either and doctors have offered to do genetic testing on my husband and i to give us a statistic for this happening again but since we have two little girls now we are not interested in living by numbers alone. i will be having my baby as naturally as possible and without drugs if possible because i just want to do everything i can to keep my body in the best shape during and after the birth so i can try this again and have a healthy baby in the future. not sure if this helps you at all but i am just speaking from my medical experience i have had recently that sounds so familiar to yours and i just wanted to share what i know so far about these two tests. hope this helps. and i am very sorry that you are going through this too. i am scared as well. but, i find great comfort in the people around me who spend a great deal of time with me to help me through these last weeks. i hope that you too have support and love abounding for you in this time.	post_3543172

post_3444877	Sep 24, 2008	607015	None	None	HiI have EDS and it certainly sounds like he has some of the issues.    I would monitor it - there is not a lot that can be done anyway, so if he doesn't seem to have vascular issues, then it is probably okay to monitor the situation and see how things develop.    I find Pilates very helpful as it promotes strength in the small muscles and encourages stability.    Throwing himself around on monkey bars should probably be avoided in favour of more controlled exercise!I hope this helps.    (Not a medical expert - just a fellow sufferer!)	post_3444280
post_3479116	Oct 02, 2008	90270	None	None	I would take him to a geneticist who is familiar with EDS to get the correct diagnosis and type of EDS he has if he is diagnosed with it. Once he gets the diagnosis then proper treatment can begin...usually involves PT and pain relieving methods. I have EDS, hypermobile type and undergo PT to keep my muscles as strong as possible. One thing you have to remember is to not do anything that will traumatize the joints in the long run. I am also seeing a rheumatologist who treats EDS.I hope this helps..Sunny	post_3444280
post_3484082	Oct 03, 2008	607015	628485	Deb115	Hi againAnother thought...what are his feet and ankles like?    Does he sprain rather than have breaks when he plays football and turns his ankles?    Does the arch seem to disappear when he stands and puts weight on his feet?    Do the ankles and toes seem flexible?    (I can use my toes to pick things up - just like little hands!)This is another clue, as most of us HMS/EDS wear orthotics to correct pronated feet (rolling in) and to support the arches.    If you suspect there are issues you could take him to a podiatrist for a biomechanical assessment.    She/he could then probably give you some useful contacts of anyone in your area that she knows is knowledgeable about EDS, as well as arranging for orthotics.Let us know how you get on!	post_3444280

Most docs only test for 30 or so mutations....With those symptoms I would push for a full analysis. I know some people who have negative sweat tests and still have CF. What was your sweat test?

The guy sitting next to me was a sufferer and told me that it hadn't helped that his grandparents were both Hypermobile and had been second cousins.    Their children therefore had no chance of not inheriting the problem!    (This is just an anecdotal story...I will leave a genetics expert to give you the facts)!	post_3436312
post_3410354	Sep 15, 2008	621375	610860	Hope375	Hi Hope - I definitely know what you are going through. My doctors found a cardiac rhabdomyoma growing in my baby's right ventrical at week 28, it has not caused any harm to her heart what so ever, thank gosh.    It looks like my husband has TSC since he definitely has all of the skin markings of the genetic disorder, we are currently undergoing all of the great testing with my eldest daughter and my husband and it has been a nightmare pregnancy. I am currently due on 9/24 and am scared to death of her being born with tubers in her brain. My doctors originally found that my baby would be born with clubfeet (not associated with TS) at 20 weeks gestation so I went ahead and took the blood test as well, your numbers are great mine were more like 1/2000, but I was also born with clubfeet so I decided agaisnt the amino because of that small chance of losing her..she is growing very well and Im hoping for the best possible outcome next week but my suggestion if it means anything what so ever is take the amino so that way you are 100% sure that the baby will not be born with something more serious. I regret not taking the test because now I am extremely nervous and trying to stay positive because of my family, you would have to request the TSC test since that is not a part of the original list of testing done. Regardless, good luck with your pregnancy because I know what it feels like to be terrified with the health of your unborn child, many endless nights of crying and suffering internally and all I can do now is face my child's outcome on the 24th...good luck!	post_3367186
post_3420555	Sep 18, 2008	610860	621375	Kathys96	Hi there, I did not get this until now.Thank you so much for your response.    I am sorry to hear you too are having a difficult time with this pregnancy and I will pray that everything turns out.    Good luck on the 24th and let me know if you feel comfortable how everything turned out.It sounds like a fetal MRI would tell you if the baby is born with tubers in the brain but I am really scaird to do it 1) because ignorance can be bliss but 2) when my husband had his MRI he said it's very noisy and for sure it scares the baby.Since all my husbands organs and skin was analyzed and no TSC, I have nothing external or DNA related either but I will go get all my organs checked out to be sure -- it is just so strange in our situation to have this happen 2x with no signs of anything.In a way I wish i got the amnio but now it's too late.	post_3367186

post_4387106	Apr 23, 2009	869906	None	None	Hi there,Based on my experience of looking after my grandmother for 6 months befor (very sadly) she went into a care home i would suggest to keep things simple as it will be a very confusing time for her from now on. Really simple things like just going to the local shop (for erercise) and listening to music (my grandma liked sinatra) but if your wife likes classical that would be great as it stimulates the mind. After she went into the home (some 16 years ago now) she used to take part in pottery class. She also used to go into the kitchen and do the staffs washing up ALL the time which kept her busy and the staff were very nice there. I still have the beautiful robin she made on my shelf. She passed away a 14 years ago but she was my rock and i loved spending time with her. Reading was very difficult for her, she would get lost and carry on with something else instead. I don't know if you have any help at all, or if you need it yet at this early stage but i would suggest you look into getting some support for yourself if you havn't already.

There are lots of drugs that have "off label" uses for lots of drugs so perhaps it was prescribed for something else.    The doctor can probably let you know what that is and why it's being used. I don't think it will hurt, but there are side effects in every    med and it would be a good idea to check drug interactions, etc. Try Drugs.com.

I hadn't heard of AlzheimAlert, so I googled it.I found that it was introduced in '02 and the company said it worked very well.

post_3839385	Jan 05, 2009	723769	567061	tweetylove	Hi.    My mum died last February but she had Alzheimers for about 5 years before she died.    She "saw" things that weren't there - like a bear in the garden, children in her bedroom, a man at her bedroom window on a ladder, cats on top of chimney pots etc. etc.    We found that the only way to deal with this was to reassure her that the problem had been dealt with, i.e. "we've put the ladder away so the man can't get to your window any more",    "we've chased the bear out of the garden and put some bear traps down so he won't come again" etc. etc. - you get the picture.    This didn't always work immediately but we found that by identifying with the problem she had rather than just saying "don't be silly, there isn't a bear" etc. it tended to work.    She would then often go onto another problem but we would deal with that in the same way.    Maybe if you said to your Mother that you had some special cream that would make the bugs go away, but that it might take a couple of days, then put some body lotion or something on her, then she may believe that the "bugs" are going away and be distracted from them.        Hope this may be of some help to you - it worked in our case, but only AFTER we had tried the "don't be silly, there isn't a bear" tactic and realised that that way wasn't going to work.	post_3838867
post_3856139	Jan 09, 2009	731610	567061	tweetylove	Hi -- My Dad needed some medication to help with his Alzheimer's induced agitation, suspiciousness, etc.    He used to think that someone stole his identity and was ordering things using his credit card.    Later, he began thinking that I was keeping him from going home (he needs assisted living for safety purposes as he took his car and was missing for days).    I would speak to her physician and let him/her know what your Mom is experiencing.    There's no need for her to endure those feelings and a small dose of medication will probably end the tactile hallucinations.	post_3838867

My grandfather saw things that wasn't there and talked off the wall.    But always redirect their thinking.    Most of the time it works and agree with them don't disagree with them it only makes them worst and upset.    I found redirecting them really helped.    Also when he would start to get lost I would ask where you going.    He would say going to his mothers.    She would be upset if he was late.    My grandfather was 90 and his mother had pasted long ago.    I would tell him ok I will take you there as soon as I check on grandma cause she is sick.    He would say ok but if you are lying to me I will kill you.    I said ok that is a deal .    So went home and he forgot where he was going and what he said.    I found just agreeing them helps.	post_3838867

That is what happened to my MIL.	post_3900423
post_3920715	Jan 26, 2009	657231	742115	lissad15	My MIL went downhill very fast. She would also vary - sometimes being lucid and then being quite well, there was no sense to what she said. It was very unpredictable.There are different kinds of dementia so you can get her checked out by a geriatric specialist who can help you. My own grandmother just needed oxygen - without it, she was quite confused but once they gave her 02, she got a lot better. So it really does pay to get a thorough check up.Even though they have the stages, from what I have seen, progression is not always as even or as laid out in those lists. My MIL would be in several stages at once.I hope you can find your grandmother's solution. I feel for you.	post_3898999
post_3718636	Nov 30, 2008	698242	698016	ELLIE69	Hi, I have worked with seniors for over 20 years with this similar problem.    I would not say it is a symptom of Alzheimer's, a full medical assesment should be done by your physician to diagnose Alzheimers.    However, for the problem with taking the pills...    if you can, crush them (check with your pharmacy to see if you can crush his meds) Some lose their strength if you crush them.    You can then mix them in applesauce or pudding.    This always worked well!    If they are in capsule form, open them and mix them in the same way.    Sometimes pills can feel like extra food, or something foreign in the mouth and therefore it feels odd.    Making it very difficult to swallow.    Hope this helps!	post_3717718
post_3809752	Dec 27, 2008	306245	None	None	I agree it wouldn't be a sign.    I bought a pill crusher for my kids or my dogs pills (have you ever tried to give a pill to a dog it isn't fun) I bought one at the pharmacy for $4.00 and crush thier pills. for adult you can put it in drinks or foods like pudding or applesauce not a lot thought you have to be sure they eat it all. by the 2-3rd stage of alzheimers you usually see people not swallowing (not all of them but some) they rather "pocket" the food. so they stuff it to the side of their cheek sometimes it is because they forget how to swallow. I have had to do reminders of this for people when I worked in the alzheimers home. Plus my hubby's grandmothers both had it.I agree check out with your doctor first it could be texture or he just doesn't like the taste of the medication.Good luckmichelle	post_3717718
post_3833719	Jan 04, 2009	725805	None	None	You may also ask for specific medications that can be crushed.    If a medication is crushed and mixed with a bit of applesauce it can be mixed with a boost or ensure drink and even end stage alz patients seem to tolerate this well.    This works just like a suspension medication we would use for infants or small children.    Very small pills that are not able to be crushed may also be floated in a larger bite of applesauce and they will sometimes slide down easier for the patients.	post_3717718
post_3882262	Jan 16, 2009	657231	698016	ELLIE69	Ask the pharmacist.In general, most can be crushed except those that are time release. Time release ones cannot be cut or crushed as they lose their potency. Ask the pharmacist next time you pick up his meds.We used to crush up my MIL's meds and mix them with her "dessert" yogurt and she ate it all down - we put the medicine in the first few spoons and then the rest helped kill the taste.Other times of the day, we used applesauce.	post_3717718

You shouldn't have to be the only caretaker but I know too well that the responsibility often falls upon one sibling. I am the soul caretaker of my frail and deteriorating 80 year old father.Your depression sounds situational. I too become depressed. I think that often goes hand in hand when you are the soul caretaker. Are you able to get out with friends? I hope you have someone who can step in and offer care for your sister so you may have time to care for yourself.I become angry too that my siblings are no help. Though I feel blessed to still have my father I have no life. I am not able to see friends or spend quality time with my husband as my father's care demands all of my time. So if it helps I can empathize.I hope you have some strong support from friends. Take care!	post_4039396

You are not responsible for him, and his heroin addiction is beyond something which you can control. He is apparently a violent abusive drunk and an addict going nowhere fast, and you are in the front car of his train to hell.    The drawbridge is out and the signal is red and he ain't slowing down. And you aren't the engineer.If he "loved" you he would stop drinking and get off the booze.Staying with this guy one more minute, if what you allege are the facts, is plan stupid.Maybe that's not what you wanted to hear, but you asked.	post_4012960

I understand it's very hard to leave someone whom you love dearly, but you do need to protect yourself... Try to persuade him to see a counsellor if you can... You are not trained to help, so it's best to leave it in the hands of someone who is experienced... It's not wise to let yourself get sucked into it together... You don't have to leave him for good, you can still be around for him as a friend until he has resolved his issues...	post_4012960

post_3742257	Dec 06, 2008	389974	None	None	The costs vary quite a bit depending on location.There are two levels of people hired to be a caregiver. There are "home aides" which perform mostly non-medical work such as cleaning and meal preparation, and there are CNAs (certified nurses assistants). CNAs have some medical training, they can take vitals and they usually have an investment in their job as a career, so they are a little more stable.The caregiver will be someone's employee, yours or an agency's. Agencies are more expensive but allow you to easily swap out caregivers that aren't working out. In addition, every agency worth its salt has an RN on staff who will visit every 4 weeks to make certain the job is being done correctly. As oversight of caregivers is a big, this is invaluable.Be sure to background check anyone you hire. You can ask them to produce a good conduct certificate in some areas, and if they are a CNA many states have a method for you to check that their license is current.I've got 4 caregivers, and 3 others, hired for two people. The caregivers range in price from just over minimum wage to $20 / hour (this is an agency caregiver).Taxes -- you should carefully talk to your tax person about this. The basic information is that you might be able to deduct from taxes the caregiver's wages that correspond to medical procedures (such as changing the dressing). However, you cannot deduct non-medical expenses (like preparing a meal). There is a tax credit for home care, and if you hire someone legally by the book, you can deduct payroll taxes.In general -- and I am being very general here -- it sounds like what you want should be doable for $2000 - $3000 / month in a inexpensive area.There is another option, which is to find someone to live with him. Sometimes you can find a student or someone just starting out who is willing to do it. Free room and board means much in this age of expensive housing.Good luck to you, this sounds like a sad situation.	post_3739274

post_3938195	Jan 31, 2009	733013	703283	Isabel81	You could try contacting your local MS Society and see if there are any patient advocates available. I am one from Pennsylvania. I have been caregiving since a child. My grandmother had MS, five of seven of my mom's siblings have had me as their homecare aide. I have a very hard time asking for money for this service! It seems so natural to get up, get dressed, and go dress,feed,encourage,etc... the patients in my care. I have lifelong experience, never finished college. I have my AS in Biological science, but stopped there to hospice my aunt with emphysema. I strive to keep the sick and disabled live in their own homes until death. I see what happens in "assisted living facilities" and nursing homes. Truthfully, there's not much difference between the two places! The minute your loved one dies in a nursing home/assisted living~ their belongings DISAPPEAR in minutes!!! Staff and other residents see to the thefts! Enjoy going to funerals for your fellow facility resident patients almost weekly. You don't go there to get better, that's for sure! I walked into a facility with "24/7" security at 3am after my shift and NOBODY stopped me, nor were the doors locked! I could have been anyone!!! I called the police. The nursing staff~ all out on a smoke break all together, leaving the patients all unattended~ didn't quite like me taking pictures of the negligence I have seen, even as a church volunteer at several facilities in three states.My SPMS patient is cruel to me only, not his family who can't bear to see him"wither away". He paid my rent twice in the year I cared for him, which is $575/monthly. I am/was there with him 3-5 hours everyday,morning and evening. Divide $575 by 30 days= $19.16 per day. I feel bad taking ANY money at all, but I am spending all my savings quickly!!!!! Anyone needing nursing care at home in Las Vegas area~ email me.	post_3739274

Many areas have an Area Agency on Aging; check with the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging.    They can be great resources for referrals.http://www.n4a.org/Your local Medicaid/Job and Family Services Office may be able to provide you with a list of agencies, as Medicaid waivers are sometimes used to pay for home health aides through nursing agencies.Here is another website that may help:http://www.eldercare.gov/Eldercare.NET/Public/Home.aspxIf your father has Medicare or Medicaid, some home health care may be covered.

post_4723696	Aug 01, 2009	985470	703283	Isabel81	It has been almost impossible for me to find one of these "home health care workers" in my city. Either they do not show at all, they want a job where they can watch television, or they try to take advantage of the patient in any way they can. The agencies do not care. The workers are totally untrained--all that is required for the job is a criminal background check.They are often illiterate which can pose dangers. They otherwise pose dangers to the patient. Workers at McDonald's have more requirements, and make the same wage. I am afraid that word gets around that it is a job you can manipulate.Maybe your city has better agencies/workers. I certainly hope so. You could use this help. I am telling you this so that you will be careful, not to be negative.	post_3739274

The procedure to contest such decisions varies from state to state.A timely protest is mandated., and an elder care attorney is recommended.One issue is who holds the "health care proxy".If they deem the patient incompetent a so-called "guardianship" proceeding is initiated, and at the hearing interested parties can present reasons to the judge as to what would be most appropriate. In theory, family members are selected over court-appointed guardians, however this is a political plumb.In fairness, state agencies are often short investigators, and you can take a one minute slice out of anyone''s life and come to a conclusion that is inappropriate.I am not sure who "Home Health Care" is.	post_4049482

DHS will do an investigation and deem if the situation is bad or not. If you have power of attorney over health care, you will be able to have a say in her placement. If you are able to care for your mom and keep her safe then there will not be a problem.I am so sorry to hear that you had this bad experience. It sounds as if you got a new home health care nurse that was not used to working in the home or in the community.Home care nurses are expected and obligated to report any thing that they perceive as neglect or abuse. Any thing can be misconstrued in a few moments.You may be able to handle this on your own, but it would be wise to have other family members, your mom's physician and others vouch for the proper care you are providing.hang in there.

post_4116826	Mar 21, 2009	144586	None	None	You ask eternal questions, for which there are no real answers.You should be extremely proud of yourself for having undertaken the responsibility placed upon you by god, to honor your father and mother. It is fact of life that the people of this world are so involved in themselves you cannot expect them to be interested in your problems, even so-called "social workers" and "physicians" who, seemingly, have some special aptitude in this area.As for "consulting a doctor", consultation with a psychiatrist may in fact effect your employment opportunities, regardless of what they say. A famous case involved a New Jersey Bank President, a military veteran, who was ordered, on penalty of dismissal, to see a psychiatrist after he was present during a bank robbbery, despite the fact he said he felt no ill effects.That single visit cost him the right to own a shotgun or firearm in New Jersey, and last I heard the case was still rumbling through the courts.In the case of the defense industries that visit can cost you your security clearance.As far as fear of losing the, enjoy and treasure them while you can. You can never tell someone you love them too many times. Never.Last weekend I said goodbye to a close friend dying in a critical care ward. I hugged him tightly and he died at four A.M. last sunday. Nobody lives forever, and being with someone in the months before they cross the bar, knowing death is coming is one of the most emotioinally trying experiences a human being can undergo.The moving finger writes, and moves on and all your piety and wit, cannot erase a single word, or cross out a line.Life can be very lonely, but when all is said and done, a decade from now you will never ever regret one minute of time that you spent with them.There is no easy "formula" as to how to divide your day/week/year. Every hour spent in an individuals life must be viewed in terms of alternatives sacrificed. There seems to a lot of "how to" suggestions (i.e. "reserve an hour a day for yourself") by the fact is, you have undertaken a tremendous burden and you are performing magnificently in the eyes of god.Nobody else counts.I think the important thing when taking care of and interacting with elderly parents is always to keep your word. If you have a dinner appointment with them and promise to be there, be on time and fulfill that obligation. Little things often take on great importance. If they give you a gift, even if it's the wrong size/color, thank them profusely. Bring your mother flowers regularly. And before they pass on make sure you call each to the side and tell them how much you appreciate all they did for you when you were a child. Trust me, you will never ever regret having hads that conversation.Hug them, and when you are near them keep your hand on their shoulder, or hold their wrists.If you have a few extra dollars purchase a Sony Play Station or a computer with a high-end graphics card and introduce them to computer games. There are lots of them, and now you don't have to be computer literate to use them. If they are happy for an hour a day playing these games you don't have to worry about taking care of them.Enroll them in a senior citizens center, where they usually serve a daytime mea, have bus trips, and where they will have a change to meet new friends and chat.If they yell at you, or criticize you inappropriately, know this is often part of the proces of aging, and don't hold it against them.In years gone by you could go to a Parish priest, but mine doesn't speak english, and is mostly interested in his own navel. There are a few yahoo groups around that include people who are caregivers.Nobody is going to understand why you are spending so much of your time with them, so don't expect a new boyfriend/girlfriend to be a shoulder to lean on.I don't know what the answer is, but when they pass on, and you visit their graves, you will know you will have fulfilled your obligations in every way, and that will provide you with a great deal of comfort.God be with you.	post_4109051

post_4148958	Mar 30, 2009	810259	None	cath	Hi there Cath, just read your post there and I can relate. It is a very difficult situation to be in and it is very isolating indeed. I look after my elderly mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago and left my job to care for her and now I am sorry I did. By the sound of your post you are an only child and all responsiblily is left to you.    I think you should talk to a doctor or social worker or something and get yourself some help if that is possible.    I know that you think it is easier for you to stop socialising etc because all you want to do is talk out your problems but the reality is that the job you are doing is so exhausting and demanding(well I am only guessing here from my own experience) that it can be really depressing. I know you love your parents and don't want to lose them but that does not take from the fact that it is not an easy job. And I know that people are caught up in their own little worlds and their own problems and don't want to hear yours but you have to have someone to listen to you and get things off your chest, just to vent. I think I am writing about myself here but I know where you are coming from and it sounds like you need some help. Go along to your doctor and just tell him/her how you are feeling and the difficulties you are experiencing. I am sure that they will give some positive help. Don't let things get out of control for yourself, you have a life too and you have to live it.    Get all the help that is possibly available to you. Talk talk and walk as much as you can, the exercise helps clear the head so that you don't want to kill anyone(only kidding but you know what I mean) Take care and remember there are thousands in the same position but there's no help there for you if you don't asktake care	post_4109051

post_4591442	Jun 23, 2009	547368	None	None	Hi Cath,As you saw by my previous post I feel your isolation. I am not an only child but my brother and sister to not help in the care of my father so I may as well be an only child.I also care part time for my elderly mother as my brother and sister have decided that it is "fair" that I do so, regardless that they do not share with my father's care. I assume you live with your parents or they live with you.There are support groups for caregivers in larger cities. Have you considered joining one of those. There are also home health care services that medicare will often pay for if one or both of your parents qualify.I encourage you to be physically active when ever possible. It helps me. Go for a walk if you can get away. When you must get groceries go to a large grocery store and take your time walking up and down the isles, looking at new products, even if you don't purchase them. This also helps me.I see that you are employed and this should at least provide you some interaction with other adults closer to your age. Some times you need to make the first move to make new friends, even though some times that can be difficult.I know there are trained professionals out there that do understand and care about what you are experiencing. And as far as seeing a physciatrist it can not effect your employment. There are many laws that prevent your employer of future employer from ever learning about your medical or mental health services. One such law is a federal one and it is called HIPPA.Yes one day you will lose your parents. We all do. So it is important to make friends and keep them close and value the few close friends that you currently have. They will support you when the time comes. You only need a few close friends. I have a lot of acquaintances but only a few close friends.I can relate. I too am caring for my parents. I some times feel isolated and alone in this process. It is a proven fact that caregivers become ill more often, are under more stress than the average person and so on and so on. It is not an easy task. I am sorry that you have to go though this alone. You can chat with me any time.Don't forget to Take Care of you too,Tuck	post_4109051
post_4595850	Jun 24, 2009	529109	547368	Tuckamore	hi tuck,thank you for your kind message. yes, i do need to get some exercise! i don't think there are any laws to prevent work discrimination in my part of the world... but that's alright... things have improved since my first post on this thread. mentally i am still able to cope and the anxiety problem is very slowly going away.i am just taking it one step at a time. of course the fear of losing my family is always there but i suppose i should be thankful that both my parents are still with me. compared to some of my friends who around my age, but who no longer have one parent with them... i have considered joining a caregivers' community once before, but because the lady who answered the phone sounded rather indifferent, i gave up the idea and decided to focus on working things thru myself by reading books on caregiving as well as anxiety issues.i have also been trying to get to know new friends... i find that widening my social circle helps... there are some old friends who have been around for me, but inevitably, as some of them become more preoccupied with starting their own families (as they rightly should at this age), i feel that it's become more important for me to seek out new people with whom i can relate...as far as work is concerned, i just do my best... i don't think it's necessarily the best job for me. but what keeps me going is that one day i will be able to pursue the career that i really want.i am sorry that your siblings are not more helpful... if they are "delegating" the responsibility of caring for both your parents to you, i hope that at least they provide you with adequate financial support?i hope that your close friends can be your pillars of strength... you can talk to me any time too via medhelp. :)	post_4109051

post_4138967	Mar 27, 2009	147211	None	nancy	What would be the signs the dr would see to order a PET scan or x-ray?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It doesn't seem that the doctors wait for a sign, or symptom, but instead they routinely order Cat Scans, Pet, MRI's. It seems its about every 3 months that they are supposed to do this for those that have breast and bone cancer - or at least thats what I have seen in my mothers case. I think there was a bigger time gap in between these last 2 scans though. She didn't have any "sign" that the cancer moved to the liver, but it did. So scans are necessary in order to watch for any changes.FYI, The doctor didn't do the mastectomy - due to her age - nor did he think she would be a good candidate for chemo - so he put her on Femora, Zometa drip, and recently started her on these two injections - the name of the med slips my mind right now.But anyhow, he now took her off the shots, also stopped the Femora, is keeping her on the Zometa and now is trying an Oral Chemo drug - Xeloda.He basically told her - this is it, but she is an incredible woman, always with a positive outlook and nothing shakes her (except seeing blood) and she said, no this is not it, I'll be fine. I think she wants to be strong for me because she knows I am not well and no time is a good time to lose your mother, but some times are worse than others and this is one of those times. So, I am trying to keep positive too.Good luck to you,MO	post_3755327
post_4137827	Mar 27, 2009	147211	804102	suzspots	I agree with you. Your mother should be with you if thats where she feels the most comfortable. My mother also has cancer-breast, bone and now we just found out the cancer is in her liver. She has been living with me for I guess its 2 years or so now. It is best for her. She has her own apartment in my house - so she has total privacy - has her garden out the back door and things like this I think keep her going - something to live for.As far as hospice care, I haven't gotten to the point - but my husbands mother is having hospice as a matter of fact -starting today. His brother and sister have been taking care of his mother (they live with her)....but now she is at the very end.. They had hospice come towards the end when their father died and hospice was wonderful. These people have a special calling on their life that work for Hospice - as far as I am concerned. You feel a burden lift or sense of relief as soon as they enter the room. They just know the right thing to say to calm people down.I would definitely look into that for your mom. I think its best for her to live with you since that's where she is the happiest.Hang in there, I know its hard. There are days I want to curl up into a ball and not wake up again. It just gets to be too much sometimes, but I have to try to hang in there too.Take care,MO	post_4129097

A nursing home is a place, where senors, who no longer can care for themselves and need assistance 24 hrs. are sent to.    I find them very depressing and senior are cared for like small children (must be feed, bath, helped walk, helped with bath room needs, etc.) since the no longer can function as they did once and they become very depress depending on someone to bath them, feed them. They get very lonley and I personally find it to be a sad, final stop for a human being.    They are taken care of, because they no longer have the physical or mental capacity as they did once to make basic decisions. There are many nursing home that are really nice if paid privately and have the family to be there always, but if paid by the state, they are at the mercy of everyone else and that's sad.    You would not want to live in a nursing home, because it is not an easy ride, free, fun place just to be taken carei f you are an able, capable person who    is rational, capable of working and can care yourself. The requirements are elderly (53 does not qualify you as elderly unless you have dimentia(dementia)or can't take care of yourself any more).    It is the final stop for elderly.	post_4045538

I dont mean this to sound as if you should give up on him, I simply believe you have to take a step back, let it alone and see what happens.

post_3793640	Dec 20, 2008	209646	None	None	I'm in Canada, health care is different here and in a small town that has a shortage of doctors.    I'm very lucky to have the doctor that I do have.    For a rural town (and surrounding area) of 6000 there are 7 family doctors.Actually hospice/pallitive care patients unless they're in their own homes in our town they are placed in the long term care facility and they also do not see doctors only nurses and nurse aides.    Pretty scary when you think about it.In the city a couple hours away there is a geriatic assessment unit and it sounds like my SIL who works at the hospital was able to pull some strings and get her in for a very quick assessment.    Normally, patients would be in the unit for a minumum of 2 weeks, but she's only getting in because of the holidays and will be in for about 2-3 days between Christmas and New Year's.    Patients get to see a number of geriatic specialists in Psychiatry, Internal Medicine, cardiology, Physical Therapy, Occupational therapy, respirologists, etc.    really a good place to be.    I wish she'd get in on the full assessment, but a few days is better than none.    There is a long wait list and this is our best option.    I hope it works out.	post_3790996

She was diagnosed with absence seizures after we were looking for an answer to her memory loss and cognitive issues.    They tried her on one med, but it didn't work for her.    She got to the point where she is now in a home.    She gets worse every day now, barely remembers anybody.They have totally disregarded my concern for her seizures and the fact that she hasn't been on any meds for them for over a year.They have now decided that she had dementia of Alzheimer's type.    I don't believe it, I'm looking for another answer.    At least something I can work with, instead of settling and just watching her leave us.I hope you have better luck than we did and that you are serious about finding help for your mother, before it is too late for her.	post_4096035

post_4073133	Mar 09, 2009	778675	None	None	Hello,Very sorry to know that your husband is suffering from so many problems, and you as his caretaker are probably suffering along with him.As he has so many problems, it is difficult for him to completely recover from all of the problems, or even to recover from even one of them completely. With so many problems, it may be difficult for you to manage alone with him. You might want to think of hospice care or of care at home with the help of trained nursing staff, if money is not a constraint.Caretakers of persons with chronic diseases become depressed and start developing diseases of their own. There is probably going to be no sudden change that is going totake place in your husband's situation. I suggest that you take care of yourself. Though this may seem heartless, this is the practical aspect.Regards	post_4070994

Normally as far as I know an Unbalanced translocation results in T21 or Down Syndrome.in Robertsonian translocation the risk for a child with down syndrome or an Unbalanced translocation is %25. I know this because my child has "typical" T21. But during research for DS I came across this related disorder. Robertsonian Translocation accounts for 4-5% of down syndrome cases.If the mom is the carier the risk for a baby is %12 if it's the father it's %3....I know I don't have translocation but I love talking to other parents.    have any of your siblings or your mother had a child with T21 translocation?TTYLCindie	post_4014224

ALL kids are different.For example, my son with "typical trisome 21" didn't walk until a few days before his 4th birthday, didn't get his first tooth til 15m and didn't smile til a year old. Although he had a very rough start and was more behind than most due to 6 months of illness and hospitalization after his birth and open heart surgery. We did have interventive therapies with him for his first 3 years where a teacher came to my home to work with him.But you know what?     IT WAS WORTH IT.

Although thalassemia carriers are most common in the populations you mentioned, it is not limited to only non-Caucasians -- it is present, for example, in Italian, Portuguese, and Greek populations as well.Since people who inherit a thalassemia gene may have smaller RBCs, it can result in slightly lower iron levels, but the good news is, as a rule, having thal trait does NOT affect the general health of the individual.    Many people who are thal carriers go through life never knowing they have the trait.    Diagnosis of thalassemia can be done either through a blood test called hemoglobinelectropheresis, or by gene sequencing.In terms of your own health, if it turns out that you that you have thalassemia trait, do not panic, as it usually does not have any significant impact on your health.    However, it will be something that you will want to address with your ob/gyn and/or a medical geneticist if you are considering starting a family or planning pregnancy in the near future.Best wishes,~eureka	post_3998676

Those that can reproduce will have a higher chance of having children with Down syndrome than someone with normal chromosomes, but there is also the possibility of producing normal, healthy children.    There are different kinds of Down syndrome, and the chances/percentages of having normal children varies depending on the individual and the kind of Down syndrome he or she has.	post_3976021

post_4230172	Mar 31, 2009	684030	759671	breakingapart	Well, you know who your mother is, so she won't need to be tested. So, why not ask the man who claims to be your father to submit to a DNA test? If you're convinced that he's not your father, the test will prove that. And, if you need to give a reason, say that you want to establish an extensive medical history and you need genetic background information because so many illness and diseases are hereditary. As far as testing, I would think that any reputable low cost family clinic could advise you on this. If they don't offer the testing, themselves, they probably would know who would or what kind of do-it-yourself testing to recommend. But, it's my understanding that this type of testing is not cheap. Too bad that you can't get much cooperation or detailed information from your mom... it would be much easier for you. Good luck!	post_4145587

Usually, an unbalanced translocation will miscarry.    I have lost three and am pregant again.    My fourth pregnancy, which resulted in my daughter, was textbook.    No problems, no issues and my daughter is perfectly healthy.    Although I don't know if she carries the same translocation as me, I can only assume that it is balanced or non-existent because she has no genetic or medical issues.    I assume you had an amnio.    Did they tell you the specifics?    They can tell if your baby is balanced or not.    As far as birth defects caused by this, there are a wide variety and the odds are specific to each individual woman.	post_4064802
post_4086776	Mar 13, 2009	570413	790182	NANNYJAN1994	Hi, there! :DThe low muscle tone makes me think a possible Chiari malformation.    This would need to be diagnosed by a trained Chiari specialist as not all radiologist nor Neurosurgeons/Neurologist understand the proper way to diagnose it.    Many believe that the herniation of the brain must be a certain degree before it is a Chiari malformation.But new studies and updated information reveals that this is not so.    So, just because her MRI was read as "normal", doesn't necessarily mean it is.    My daughter's was read by MANY doctors as normal, but she actually did have a Chiari malformation.You may want to consider doing a lot of reading about Chiari malformation in kids, and send a copy of your granddaughter's MRI to a specialist (like the one in Chicago or New York) to have them evaluate it for what is called, Chiari Zero or Borderline Chiari.If you do a google search for "Chiari" lots of really good sites should pop up that can explain tons.    Also, there are several Yahoo support groups for parents and family members of Chiari patients.    These are very helpful since no two Chiari patients will manifest symptoms exactly alike.A few of the symptoms Chiari can manifest are:Low muscle toneSpeech delaysDifficulty swallowing/chokingGI issuesBalance problemsGait disturbancesVisual disturbancesHeadachesSensitivity to light, noise, or hot/coldSleep disturbancesThere are many, many more which the websites I mentioned above will be able to give you in more detail.I hope and pray that your family is able to find answers to the mystery of your granddaughter's condition.Blessings to you and your entire family,Rebecca	post_4079364

post_4030971	Feb 25, 2009	419309	775045	moonarora	Although down syndrome is a genetic condition, because your husband's uncle is affected does not necessarily mean that your baby is at increased risk for down syndrome. Down syndrome is more often the result of spontaneous mutation and less often passed down through family inheritance.    The triple marker can be a useful screening tool, but generally it is drawn after 15 weeks GA (gestational age) for best accuracy, and even then, it is only estimated to have a 60-70% sensitivity.    Keep in mind that blood screening, even those with more sensitivity than the triple marker, will not diagnose the presence or absence of down syndrome, only give you risk percentages.    (In your case, your triple marker is estimating the possibility of your baby having down syndrome at about 1/3 of 1% chance.)Only you (with your doctor) can decide what is best for you.    Amniocentesis does carry risks, but it will give you a definite answer if you need one. Perhaps you and your husband need to discuss the question of raising a child with down syndrome and weigh the risks and benefits of the amnio procedure, and whether or not it would be worthwhile and beneficial for you to obtain chromosome information at this point in your pregnancy.Best wishes to you,~eureka	post_4023882

You will most likely need a shot of something called Rhogam in this pregnancy and in your future pregnancies.    If the father of your baby is also rh negative factor, you do not need to have this Rhogam shot, but if the blood rh factor of your partner is positive or unknown, being rh negative just means you will need to get the shots to make sure the rh negative in your blood doesn't harm the baby.Best of luck to you and your new family-to-be!~eureka	post_4026990

It is essentially a placental biopsy, whereby villi (cells from the placenta) are extracted (by needle or catheter) and viewed under a microscope.

They were both tested at a year when they were routine tested for lead and my 3 year old boy has it, my girl doesn't.    From what I gather, it's a lot easier to deal with when you're a boy than a girl because of periods and pregnancies.    Just be sure to ALWAYS let your doctor know that you have it (and them too if they do) for surgery purposes....and if they already know, remind them everytime.    I also have the Protein S deficiency which I gather pretty much goes hand in hand with the Factor 5.    I don't think it puts you at too much of a greater risk.    But this Factor 5 does mean that you got it from one of your parents...if you weren't aware of that.    Some people can go on their WHOLE lives with never having a clot and a lot of people walking on this earth right now aren't even aware they have it...we're one of a lucky few to know (though you may not look at it that way)..

I have just found out that I am positive for the Factor II and VIII gene mutation but not the V.    I do have a family history, 2 sisters have had 2 clots each both pulmonary and DVT.    My Protein S is also low.I'm on HRT after a total hysterectomy last March so I have been referred to a Hematologist.    My GYN wasn't sure about the Factor VIII and transdermal hormone replacement.    What I have going in my favor is that I am 49 and had my 2 kids, have been on the pill at one time in my life, and have had major surgery, all with no problems but now that I know I have this I'm not sure what my future holds.    I really don't want to be on Coumadin or stop the HRT.It's confusing trying to look up information.    I thank you for your questions b/c I have been unsure what to ask, other than most obvious ones concerning my HRT and having my 2 girls tested (which I will do b/c it will affect them the rest of their lives).The one question that I think I can answer is the first one.    I'd say, unless your doctor advises you to stop the Coumadin, continue to take it.    It doesn't matter that you haven't a family history or that it's your first occurrence, you now have a history of clots.    Both the aforementioned sisters did not know they were positive for the Factors when their clots occurred but they've been on Coumadin since the clots happened.I'd suggest seeing a Hematologist unless you have already.    They will be able to answer you questions more thoroughly.I agree with little_linz2001...now we know and although it's kind of strange to me knowing this, I'm glad I know now before something happened.Good luck to you!	post_3910714

If PKU is identified, the bay is automatically put on a PKU diet to prevent brain ratrdation.     The diet is strict and I believe that milk and soy is the first type of food that needs to be eliminated from the baby's diet at birth when the sysndrom is identified by the doctors (I am not an expert).    There are many web sites that explain this syndrom(syndrome). You might want to Google PKU.    There are also some free organizations that you can identify by using Google. These organizations might be able to help her and give you a brochure in her language to help her. She also should try to find a local European PKU organization, maybe sponsered / funded by the European Union Health Department to help her. Helping her from the USA would be hard because of the diet. It is my undersatnding that the diet is hard.    She should have been on this diet since birth. I am surprised that her doctor did not help her. I am also from a very poor country in Europe and a very poor village and I know that the help is out there in Europe (if she has the web and the resourses).

As you pointed out, you have 55 repeats and you have no problems :).    She'll probably be a lot like you!The fragile x gene has been recorded to expand in offspring when it is greater than 59 repeats in the parent -- there are NO cases of mothers who have 55 repeats causing their children to have fragile x syndrome.    As a rule, fragile x of greater than 200 repeats is what causes fragile x syndrome (and even then, it usually affects boys more so than girls).    I truly believe you do NOT have to worry about fragile x affecting your baby girl.Enjoy your pregnancy, and best wishes to you!Congratulations on your coming family :).~eureka	post_3786611

post_4494283	May 24, 2009	914359	356135	umya	My advice to you would be to move your dad to another nursing home that does not have a policy of chemical restraint.    If that isn't feasible forbid the use of all antipsychotics;    not just risperidol.    When my husband, who has Parkinson's, was hospitalized for 3 months due to a ruptured gallbladder I spent every waking hour trying to keep his recuperation on track.    Despite the fact that I was bedside 12-14 hours a day, there were at least 5 incidences of nurses administering antipsychotics for supposed "agitation" when I was absent. The effects were terrifying and I am convinced that his hospitalization was prolonged by the use of these drugs.    I raised hell with everyone in the chain of command, ie nurses, supervisors, directors, patient liaison.    It got to the point at the end where I checked his med list with the nurse daily to insure nothing had changed.    When he was transferred to a rehab facility, he seemed to regress, ie despondent, hallucinating occasionally, lethargic.    It was quite by accident that I discovered that the hospital, after all that had transpired, sent him on to the rehab facility with a nighttime prescription for risperidol.    The attending physician had no problem cancelling the use of the drug since she had not originally prescribed it and was not wed to the idea of its use.    Within days, my husband's personality reappeared.I guess my point is that if it is the policy of institutions to use these drugs irrespective of a patient's medical history or behavior I don't think you can win.    You could hope that your dad gets a nurse like Emma, but I know for a fact that there are too many out there    who want to simplify their jobs by using chemical restraint.    At one point, when my husband's adverse reaction to an antipsychotic resulted in violent tremors and hallucinations, I had his neurologist paged.    He administered a drug to stop the tremoring and told me "get him out of here before they kill him."    This doctor, by the way, also has Parkinsons and in his opinion medications should be kept to a minimum and antipsychotics should not be used.I hope you can manage to set things right for your sake and for your dad.	post_4446257

post_4516992	May 31, 2009	535822	None	None	I am so sorry.... it is hard for your Mom and yourself , perhaps the meds are causing some of this, ask her Doctor if she could be weaned off and try something else, do it with her Doctors help, the meds can help but many times make anxiety worse, try to keep her mind as active and busy as you can, does she get out ,go for a walk, it is important that she doesnt just sit around all day, people around ,does she live at home? let us know    how she is doing .	post_4515857
post_4521121	Jun 01, 2009	924457	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Hi.    I have had a lot of experience with Alzheimers with my mom and grandmother. I am also a trained helpline volunteer with the Alzheimers Association.Paranoia is one of those things that people with Alzheimers experience.     It comes from the person not being able to interpret their world anymore and sometimes it can be quite intense.     Sometimes the PWD (Person with the Disease) hallucinates and then cannot separate fact from vision and to them it is very very real.     There is not much that can be done and I'm not sure Zoloft is a great idea only in that it suppresses a person - but if it works to calk her down then it can be good.        Sometimes the only thing you can do is get them out of the situation (move them to a room that brings them comfort) or distract them if that is possible.     Mom might express the same fears over and over and it is your job to be patient with her in repeating your acceptance of what "she is seeing or feeling" and your reassurance that you will protect her as best you can.     Sometimes the PWD can be running an infection like a UTI that can cause her to hallucinate so if you think she is going to the bathroom a lot and having problems with paranoia because she is seeing things, then I would take her to her doctor to rule out any type of infection.	post_4515857
post_4521202	Jun 01, 2009	924457	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Thinking about your mom some more - imagine what she is going through - you'd be scared if nothing in your world made sense.    What your mother may be experiencing is not necessarily paranoia but that can happen too.     Your mother may not remember anything of her surroundings and everything seems strange to her all the time - even if you explain to her that she is safe, she is at home, you are there and will protect her.    She may forget your words of comfort no matter how calm or how often you say it to her because depending on the status of her dementia she is incapable of being able to learn new things - which is what memorization is.    So her being afraid is most common and her crying is not unusual if she can't figure out where she is or what is happening to her - or perhaps who the people are around her if she doesn't recognize you or any other family members.    It is a very sad and cruel disease.    I feel for you - and can totally empathize with how you feel.	post_4515857
post_4530102	Jun 04, 2009	212161	None	None	thank you so much , i can tell you are a very caring erson and the words do make since, my dad is still here but he works part-time at 75 thats what keeps him alive, he is not a care taker and cant be with her to long before he startes getting up-set with her than it makes matters worse. so its onmy shoulders to take care of her most the time, she still knows who we are and knows alot thats going on around her, but at times shes like in another world, never wants to be left byself, so we try and work things out where am at home when hes not. i also work parttime so there are    days where she has to be byself, shes not in danger as far as cutting stove on and forgetting that , we are watching her very close to see when these things happen so we would never leave byself. i love my mom so much and its so hard to change roles now am the mom shes the child.    her mom had it now her so am very scared i might there are four of us daughters so we are all scared of getting it and when i forget something i get scared.    God Bless you for being a care taker thats not a easy job and you really have to be cut out for it. thank you for all the info we will try a few of them see what happens. Barbara	post_4515857
post_4537511	Jun 06, 2009	470136	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	My mom passed away Nov. 07 from Alzh. so my heart goes out to you. I don't want you to take what I'm telling you the wrong way, but it gets to the point when the medical field comes in and takes over the show, and they tell you what you are going to do. If you don't, the Dr. can get legal custody of you mother and put her in a facility of his choosiing. When it gets to that point, you might as well put her somewhere convenient for you. Has anybody ever mentioned SUNDOWNERS. When the sun goes down, it has a major impact on Alz. patients. Good luck and spend as much time with your mom as possible.	post_4515857

post_4572705	Jun 17, 2009	535822	None	None	It sounds like it could be the Meds he is on as I know they can have side effects, did they wean him off the Strattera and Adderall(adderrall)or did he stop immediatly ,the headaches and other symptoms you describe could be withdrawal it would be best to ask his Doctor about that. You have to go by your gut feeling with this , personally and I do mean just that... I would make sure he isnt going to get another set of side effects from the new Meds.. You can google for side effects of the new ones he will be taking, Does he work with any Toxins ? You have my sympathy , its not easy is it, I hope he feels better soon.	post_4571980
post_4750755	Aug 10, 2009	940738	535822	margypops	We still do not have a diagnosis.    He weaned off all of his meds.    He is on B-12 and Folic acid only.

post_4764145	Aug 13, 2009	535822	None	None	I have just googled for an update, it says larger trials are starting this year 2009 so you may be able to get Rember if you found out if there is a trial nearest to you, google the Medical news and put Rember in, it is in the 2nd of a 3rd year trial at Aberdeen Uni versity and has been shown to have had success in halting the progress of mental deterioration .It should be on the market by 2012 ...It sounds like the best thing I have read about to date I have a husband may be battling early stages, due to working with Toxins in the Boat building business.	post_4571980

We just had to accept what we could not change.One thing I have always not understood, is it true that, these patients have an occasional good day, it would make no medical sense to me, but honestly seemd a few days that Grandma was much more alert and even knowing of her visitors.?

My mom lives with me and she has alz: She keeps asking me to take her home even though she is at home. If I tell her she is home she says "don't tell me that"    Last night when I was putting her in bed, she begged me to take her home in the morning and I said yes mom I will and she was very happy.

So I say let him smoke unless his Doctor says NO and even then your Dads    own Body. Good Luck	post_4601353

Dr basically surmise that a person has alzheiimers by the way they act. Alzheimers is named after a Dr. who discovered that people develop plaque in their brain which is what causes the memory loss.	post_4540286

I also know that if you put it into google it will tell you symptoms /tests etc you can do. I do a lot of research that way about other ailments.    Check out some of the other threads here that members have put up with their symptoms.I appreciate this must be concerning for you, a few years ago I was doing the same thing I found it was the meds I was on as soon as I stopped taking them my short term memory was okay. Some supplements do the same thing like 5HTP and Sam -E .    Hey and welcome to Med Help ..	post_4540286

After 9 days I will give you more breathing techniques to do.I encourage anybody else to follow this and tell us how they feel.Forgetting ATM card - do you get more than one episode a day, when you forget something.Keep a note of these episodes.	post_4540286

I am an Orthopedic Surgeon and I had to resign from my job due to this illness.    I went through extensive testing, and I am waiting to get a PET Scan.My short term memory is severly compromised, your symptoms are quite similar to mine.    My Neuro Psych revealed severe cognative damage, specifically in short term memory.There are medications that help your cognition,one of    them is Aricept.Also there are suppliments that can help.I recomend that you get a book called the Miracle Brain, go to Amazon, and you can get the book for a few dollars.

post_4589332	Jun 23, 2009	180749	930651	amber835	Hello AmberI am back with the set of pranayam which you can follow, and advise your patients to follow to improve quality of life and have better health.The Yog Pranayam (breathing exercises) will    help you relax and also help to improve the memory.It provides extra oxygen and stimulates the left and right side of brain.Build up your timing gradually. If you feel tired or dizzy, stop and resume after 1 minute.Bhastrika - Take a long deep breath into the lungs(chest not tummy) via the nose and then completely breathe out through the nose. Duration upto 5 minutes.Anulom Vilom -Close your right nostril with thumb and deep breath-in through left nostrilthen - close left nostril with two fingers and breath-out through right nostrilthen -keeping the left nostril closed    deep breath-in through right nostrilthen - close your right nostril with thumb and breath-out through left nostril.This is one cycle of anulom vilom.Repeat this cycle for 15 to 30    minutes twice a day.You can do this before breakfast/lunch/dinner or before bedtime or in bed.Remember to take deep long breaths into the lungs.You can do this while sitting on floor or chair or lying in bed.Kapalbhati -(Do it before eating) Push air forcefully out through the nose about once per second. Stomach will itself go in(contract in). The breathing in(through the nose) will happen automatically. Establish a rhythm and hold your head steady. Not for pregnant women. Seriously ill people do it gently.Do this for 15 to 30 minutes twice a day.Bhramri Pranayam -Close eyes. Close ears with thumb, index finger on forehead, and rest three fingers on base of nose touching eyes. Breathe in through nose. And now breathe out through the nose while humming like a bee.Duration : 5 to 12    timesOnce you are better, continue the pranayam once a day.Be patient, as the benefits will show over a period of months.Only by doing you will benefit and feel good because you are helping your body.Keep a note of what you forgot, to see how many episodes you have per day/week/month and then you will see a trend. This trend will help you see whether the memory is improving.You can do anulom vilom several times a day to keep the brain active.Try to say a phone number you know, in reverse(from last digit to first digit).	post_4540286

From what I have researched, it is the body shutting down that takes the patient.    They start to not want to eat so nutrition plays a big part in it in the latter stages.    If they get something like pneumonia, it's harder and harder for them to recover.    Grandma was diagnosed with it in her early 80's and she died from pneumonia at the age of 92.

post_4520559	Jun 01, 2009	923268	535822	margypops	I could speak with my doctor two hours and he didnâ  t offer me a satisfactory explanation about my case.He said that this condition is due to ageing(aging), but didnâ  t elaborate much more on this. I insisted with him about being a possible indication of Alzheimer Disease and he said that no other findings are present in the CT on this direction. I suggested some excessive alcohol consumption could be a cause for the cortical atrophy, but he finds this unlike to be a reason.Finally I told him that it could be wise to take a further scanning within half a year or so, but he recommended two years and asked me not to think too much about this.As my doctor is a general practioner, I intend to visit a neurologist as soon as possible. In the mean time I took some decisions, just in case: stop drinking alcohol and look for a better quality nutrition, may be with appropriate vitamins, and natural supplements able to help brain irrigation. And I will keep looking for answers and advice in different fora, at least to get guidelines on how to monitor the problem and control any development as far as possible.Concerning my English â  proficiencyâ  , it goes without saying that I work in an international environment in the scope of the European Union activities. But as a telecommunications engineer I have a better English writing for technical rather than for medical matters! Thanks a lot and best wishes!	post_4517648

post_4481579	May 20, 2009	535822	None	None	I am so sorry it must be very hard for him and for you and your Mom, I am wondering that if he is on Meds whether there could be some side effects from them as this came on suddenly how about you ask the Dcotor who is prescribing you can also go online put the drugs in and get information about inter actions, between drugs.Good luck let us know how he is doing	post_4480285
post_4482440	May 20, 2009	445176	None	None	Thank you, margypops.One of the diagnoses was a drug interaction - he was on 5 chemo drugs, 2 sugar meds, bp meds, vicodin, aspirin, and a couple of other things.    But, they told us that if there was a bad interaction it would show up in the blood, so they tested and tested and tested his blood, found nothing.Update: He went to the physical therapist, who said it seems like he has herpetic encephalitis.    And it actually fits all his symptoms, and the time frame.    I wonder why the physical therapist was the first to mention this.    In this last hospital stay he saw an er doc, 2 internists, two neurologists, a cardiac surgeon, 2 dermatologists, and countless nurses, and nobody mentioned herpetic encephalitis, even tho they know he's got shingles, aka herpes zoster.    the pt said we should ask his reg doc about a drug (whose name I can't remember right now), and antiviral that's supposed to clear this thing up.    finally, a bit of hope	post_4480285
post_4483104	May 20, 2009	535822	None	None	Finally a bit of hope that says it all doesnt it, my Mom went through similar,but not as hard as your Dad, hope he finds he is feeling better soon, how good it is to hear how much you care that must be a big comfort to him, Keep us up to date with his progress..	post_4480285
post_4486255	May 21, 2009	445176	None	None	Update: We got an appointment with his PCP about 5:30pm, 7 hours after the pt's visit.    She isn't convinced about the therapist's diagnosis of herpetic encephalitis, so she sent him to a neurologist, who saw him that night, a little after 7pm.    And, of course, his diagnosis was different than everyone else's.    Long story short, he said it sounds like a combination of depression from the crippling effects of the shingles in his right hand, the fact that he hasn't slept since the end of March (not more than a half hour at a time - he lays around the house all day, but doesn't get any sleep), and he pretty much stopped eating and drinking, is losing tons of weight, and he only weighed 137 to begin with.The neurologist prescribed Zoloft for the depression, and some other drug (sequorel, maybe?) to make him sleep.    The second drug is actually an antipsychotic, but it's known to make people get restful sleep.    He also told us to make sure he drinks and eats as much as he can.    Doc said to ignore the diabetes for now, just get him to eat and drink.So yesterday was terrible, he needed to be dragged around everywhere, couldn't speak, wouldn't respond to any outside stimulus in any way.    My mother tried to get him to take his normal pills, and he just let the pills fall out of his mouth.    She tried to take him temperature and he kept his mouth clamped shut.    But, today, after one sleeping pill, he's actually talking, every so little, but it's encouraging.    He's eaten an entire bowl of oatmeal, a banana, and drank 24oz of oj.    These are minor things, but we're hoping it's the start of a trend of improvement.	post_4480285

post_4457751	May 13, 2009	765070	None	None	I really do not think moving her will phase her much since she does not remember much.    Just having someone there to comfort her and be nearby is what is definitely best for her.    She may not know who you are but she does know that someone is there for her consistently.When my Grandfather had AZ, he did not remember anything that he did at that time but remembered things about the Korean War and other various activities done 30 - 40 years before.    He also did remember faces but of course did not recognize who they were or why they were there.    But, he did say a few times that he was glad to see someone again if they came back to visit him from day to day.    So, it does have an impact on them if they see you on a regular basis.	post_4448113

post_4600523	Jun 26, 2009	547368	None	None	Hi Dor,You are taking on a huge responsibility, bless your heart. I take care of my 80 yr old father full time in my home and my 77 yr old Mom about 60% of the time. There are many challenges.SS offers no help for seniors other than Medicare. They will not deduct money from your Mom's SS for her medical care (or any other care) and allocate it to you either. This is a national law and to my knowledge does not change state to state. Medicare will provide some limited in home nursing care. OT and PT if your Mom qualifies.Her physician can order that, again if she qualifies.However every state has offers some type of services for the elderly. In Wisconsin they have just begun to offer medical coverage to all low income residents. Their is a price attached to the insurance but it can be reasonable. As Kobul suggested, Social Services can provide you with that information. In my state there is very little available if the parent resides with a child and nothing to cover health care costs.Good luck to you.Tuck	post_4599474
post_4928796	Sep 30, 2009	1056440	None	dor603 and everyone	Caregiving is a calling, a gift if you will.    It may not seem that way after you have been doing it past your patience point, but believe me it will get much more intense and interesting. You see beloved, you must make a decision in the beginning stages of your caregiving that you have settled all the arguments in your heart about whether or not you are doing the right thing, Heart arguments such as should you give up your life for another, will it be worth it in the long run, how much longer will this love one live, am I gonna get help from anyone else?, am I qualified and so on.    Everything you need to accomplish this goal has been put on the inside of you and all you have to do is surrender your will, your ways, your thoughts, and all your abilities to the Creator, because they will only get in the way and cause confusion and there will be no peace in your home.    This will cause the one you are caring for to be stressed, depressed, anxious, and praying for permanent relief, He or she will lose faith in you and you will begin to doubt yourself too.    Take a deep breath and pray.    Give it to the One who made us and He will give you such grace, peace,creativity/ways to make your job easier, a forgiving heart and an abundance of love for the person (s) you are caring for. Then you will have no doubts and be fully persuaded that you are called to be a caregiver. Caregivers must begin to pray for caregivers and call each other up and share ideas and support with each other. Medicare is changing, Home Care Companies will have no choice but to change and that means Caregivers will be required to pick up where these companies end. I will tell you more about that in the coming weeks.    I am praying for much love, compassion, patience, and success for not only Caregivers, but for all people all over the world.    Be good to yourself and others.    jlanadirah53	post_4599474
post_4932816	Oct 01, 2009	547368	1056440	jlanadirah53	I have been a caregiver most of my life in one form or another. You either are or you aren't and everyone has their own approach. What works for one does not necessarily work for another. We all have different strengths.Caring for a loved on in their home or yours 24/7 is far different than caring for ppl that you are not related to you in a facility. Medicare already does very little for seniors. 30-90 days of stopping in to check on a patient once a week is very little help and leaves everything on the caregivers plate.Some ppl just aren't cut out for caring for a loved one, no mater how hard they try or how much they may love that parent or person. That doesn't make them a bad person, nor less of a person. Frankly I don't want my children or anyone to sacrifice and give up their lives for me. I lived my life and they should have that liberty also. I chose to care for my parents but for my siblings that is not their choice. Again that does not make them less of a person. It just makes them different from me.Take Care,Tuck	post_4599474

post_4749788	Aug 09, 2009	547368	None	None	I have found that there are more trustworthy and competent caregivers than not IF you go through an reputable agency. There are also video-cams that you can use for monitoring that I would recommend for piece if mind.Payments are another story. It is a sad fact that there really is little to no financial help to keep loved ones in their homes. It never ceases to amaze me that the government, even some insurance policies will pay thousands of dollars in nursing home payments for inpatient care but is unwilling to pay a few hundred dollars a month towards respite care/relief for those caring for loved ones.Best of luck to you.Tuck	post_4406748
post_4753459	Aug 10, 2009	985470	None	all	The caretakers here are paid minimum wage. They have no training at all.The agencies just want them to stay put and bring in money. The agencies and the state support each other's fault, so that they all can have a job. Much fault is with the state legislature, for not allowing higher wages.The caretakers know nothing about health or sanitary household conditions. They damage items in the house.In our state, medicaid pays for a caretaker if income of the patient is below about 1700. per month.aaThe cameras are a great idea, for patients who are not able to monitor the workers.	post_4406748
post_4753470	Aug 10, 2009	985470	None	sailfishhoney	Again, I think you can get some help, but you will have to do a lot of supervision, unless you find a rare, responsible agency. The best deal seems to be finding your own worker, putting them with an agency, and go through medicaid if you qualify. You can even reduce their hours on a confidential level, so that the result is higher wages. People will work temporarily for minimum wage, but not for long.	post_4406748

Our state (medicaid) does not pay for an in home care taker, ever.Medicare will provide short term (usually 90 days) health care monitoring by health care professionals if you qualify. These agencies are highly scrutinized by Medicare and their standards must be high. No one is paid minimum wage. They will also take private pay or insurance pay patients.Vision, I am glad I do not live in your state!Tuck	post_4406748
post_4780174	Aug 18, 2009	985470	None	Tuckamore, Sailfishhoney	The program I speak of is designed to keep people out of nursing homes. Not all agencies participate in the program.To qualify for this kind of home care, the patient's income can be about three times higher than the ceiling for other medicaid services.The services are free for the patient, and up to 40 hrs/week can be provided.Untrained workers. Minimum wage. My friend has a nice worker right now, who has medical assistant training. She has had 2 nice workers in 3 years. Workers turn over very quickly. One "care" person broke her arm months ago, and she still does not have use of the arm, due to rotator cup complications. Many other negative incidents--stealing, trying to con the patient, exposing the patient to very dangerous situations.She does have some good help now--for the past 2 weeks.	post_4406748
post_4787383	Aug 20, 2009	985470	547368	Tuckamore	Is the medicare program you are referring to the one that send an RN to change bandages for surgery patients, for example, and also for physical therapy? Since Sailfish honey's husband is on SSI, does her description of his condition make him a candidate for the services you described?	post_4406748
post_4788385	Aug 20, 2009	547368	None	None	Good question Vision. What he would require is an medical incident or a hospitalization to qualify, basically a change in condition. At least that is my opinion and experience.My father is eligible to receive Medicare Home Health Care (lives in my home) for 60 days. Yesterday he was re-certified for another 60 days. Medicare will not continue this forever. What has been suggested is after this 60 days he be transferred to the Hospice Program. I have been out of this type of nursing for some time and was not familiar with the new Hospice Program. I thought it was for ppl that had just several weeks or months to live. The requirement for Hospice is a DX of an end stage disease or condition. In my father's case he has end stage lung disease. He could pass on tomorrow but he could also be here another year or possibly two.I don't know if Sailfishhoney's husband would qualify for Hospice or any other program but it never hurts to look into eligibility. They are federal so it dos not change significantly from state to state.I learned that any medications related to the illness that is deemed "end stage" is paid at 100% through the Hospice Program. There are more visits and care allowed and several other similar benefits. The agency that has been coming to our home to evaluate and monitor my father has been wonderful. They respect him and have helped him greatly with pain regulation and adjustment. Sometimes she just ends with chatting with my father and reminding him that he "makes the calls."Yesterday the RN cried with me when I said it was tearing me apart to watch my formerly stout, strong, wise and proud father deteriorate and lose his independence. So I do know there are good agencies with competent and qualified professionals out there. This is the same agency that I had for my mother last year when she had an extensive heart surgery and came to my home for 4 months to monitor and assist her with recovery and rehabilitation.A discharge social worker in a hospital of the agency in her state that is responsible for aging or social services of her county should be able to inform her of any available services.However though he is entitled to some home care benefits I am entitled to nothing for the care that I provide him, which is 24/7. That was Sailfish's question.Blessing to all of you caretakers. I walk in your shoes too and know how very difficult the journey can be.Tuck	post_4406748
post_4791064	Aug 21, 2009	985470	None	Tuckamore, Sailfishoney	I understand Sailfishoneys question now that you have explained.I am so moved that your father is receiving excellent medical care, and that you and your father are getting support. I am also moved by your taking care of your father.My mother and I did not have a good relationship, but I would have seen to her every need, if she had not had excellent help. I would go to the hospital to spend the night in her room, even though she had not treated me well--ever. I needed to feel that I was doing everything to give her comfort. Even if she rejected it, I had to make efforts to extend additional help and support. She suffered psychologically at the end, and she was also in pain. Even though she was not good to me, I always had respect for her welfare. It was very painful to see her suffer. She, like your father, had always been strong.My good friend recently lost her mother at 93. They brought her home from the excellent nursing home, the last weeks of her life. They really believed that she wanted to be there. My friend had cared for her at her home for about 20 years. Her mother did very well until the last six months of her life. My friend retired at that time, and she gave care 24/7, just like you. One of the reasons that she is my friend is because of how she has cared for her mother. Her mother and her were very close.I think she will always value the experience of taking care of her mother.	post_4406748
post_4792232	Aug 21, 2009	547368	None	None	Vision,It sounds like you did everything you could for your Mom, in-spite of the fact that she was not always supportive to you. Unfortunately my mother and our relationship sounds very much like yours and your Mom's. I have been caring for her about 60-70% of the time in my home for the last 15 months. My siblings have had her the remainder of the time. Two weeks ago I gave up her care because I could not care for both of them and this has been Dad's home for five years. (I'm disabled myself) She is extremely ungrateful and difficult to deal with or care for but that's another story, one I may post as guilt is eating me up.My Dad (also my friend) is failing fast. Last night he fell for the first time. His once 6' 5" height is now just 6'1" and his 185 lbs is now down to 155. He is still extremely difficult to pick up from the floor. Though we have wonderful support once a week there is no one that can help with his care. I know that I am not the only one that is a constant caregiver and it helps to know there are others. I am not that all that old but I have a lot of physical pain and limitations due to a MVA near 20 years ago and finally had to give up my career in June of 08. My limitations adds greatly to the difficulties in caring for my Dad.Your friend sounds like a jewel. I have never thought of the possibility that she chose. It was brave and loving of her to allow her Mom spend the last weeks of her life at home with her daughter. How inspiring!But yes there are wonderful agencies out there. I'm sure there are a few that are not so wonderful. And even the current agency we use has a RN that is not warm and pleasant. I just requested that she not come to our home again.But unfortunately there is just no re-numeration for caring for those that we love, at least none that I am aware of.	post_4406748
post_4794345	Aug 22, 2009	985470	547368	Tuckamore	I regret to hear that about your situation, and your dad's situation. It makes me very upset; it could happen to any of us. I am also disabled, but I have no loved one that needs care.I do not know what state you are in, but the state department that handles cost-free caregivers in my state the Department of aging and disabilities. These people help with housework, grocery and pharmacy shopping, giving medication, bathing,etc.You sound very knowledgeable, but I just wanted to make sure you had this info about my state, in case it could help.	post_4406748
post_4794917	Aug 22, 2009	547368	None	None	Thank you Vision. I live in Wisconsin. Apparently once a person is on hospice all those cost-free (to the patient) services are available. I have checked and there is no cost free care giving, housework, grocery shopping, etc for those that cannot pay in this state. It would cost $30.00 an hour to have someone come sit with Dad or $50.00 for half a day if I took him to a day-care center. But I would have to haul oxygen and medication and the trip to and from would be difficult for him, impossible some days.Mind you I do all the grocery shopping and such things as this is my home....but sometimes I make two and three trips a week to either the pharmacy or taking my Dad for medical care. It would be wonderful if someone would just take care of those pharmacy trips. He's on so many meds and their are often changes or increases. We live 12 miles the closest clinic and pharmacy.I'm sorry to hear that you are disabled also. I know how very trying that can be!! Thank you again for your suggestions.	post_4406748

post_4536498	Jun 06, 2009	724066	None	None	Hi, my late dad had posies (restraint) at night, so he would not get out of bed.    He was never restrained in his wheelchair.    My mom has one on her sitting moving chair, she no longer can walk, but she tries to get up.    Hope this helps.	post_4522929
post_4537300	Jun 06, 2009	887109	None	None	There have been incidents in the past where an elderly person slid down out of the chair with a seat belt on and was strangled.Some of these incidents in the past ended in death, otheres ended in the patient suffering anoxia(lack of oxygen to the brain,To prevent this form occurring, the regulations now require that no form of restraint should be used, thus the development of the seat and bed alarms.It is the same reasoning for half side rails on a bed versus the full side rail. All of these regulations and safety measures are the results of deaths or severe injury suffered by others in the past.	post_4522929

post_4644020	Jul 09, 2009	547368	None	None	Dianecarbo is correct. The use of any restraints, either chemical or mechanical requires a physicians order.There are many new devices such as she describes, bed, seat and mat alarms. These tools were developed with the safety of our elderly in mind and due to tragic accidents and occasional misuse. Staff must be especially alert and quick to respond to any of these alarms or they are useless. Poesy restraints are rarely used. In most facilities in our state they are banned.Chemical restraints are often used in conjunction with alarm devices for the residents that are still felt to be a danger to themselves.Tuck	post_4522929

post_4587763	Jun 22, 2009	547368	None	None	Bless your heart Cath. Do you care for a parent?I am being treated by a wonderful physician for my chronic pain. It doesn't help the pain in my heart for my father.The last time I left my father overnight in our home (with his girlfriend) when I returned he was in severe pain and suffered another compression fracture. She put his feet up to decrease his edema and that was the end result. There is no one that can step in. I can't afford to hire a trained caregiver and he would never allow it. He has four new compression fractures in less than three months.He has end stage lung disease (asbestos exposure). His spine is also literally crumbling. Therefore this once stanch, independant and kind and wonderful man is going through the grieving process. He trusts no one but me. He becomes very loud and angry when forced to go to the Doctor or hospital.Indeed I just brought him home from a two night hospitalization on Saturday. It should have been a respite for me but I had to be at the hospital a minimum of three times a day so the running back and forth was extremely draining. I also used that time to clean out his room and wash everything in there.I had to intervene several times with him and the nursing staff. He can become very rude and mean to them. They are unable to do anything to please him though I think they give good care. And as a former nursing staff member of the hospital I know their patient care standards are high.I don't know how much longer my Dad has in this world. It could be a few years or a few weeks. I could never live with myself if I placed him in an alternative living situation. And he does know how to lay the guilt on me. So I am trying hard to hang in there and looking for answers to keep me going. Due to a traumatic MVA my health has not been good for some time. But I am all my father has.I am trying to talk Dad into some home health care, for which he qualifies. So far I have been unsuccessful. Thanks for listening. It is appreciated.Tuck	post_4587454

Home health care is also a very good resource.    I still have the arm pull up (?) for the bed and bath chair for my Mom, she is now in long term care.    She would try to run away from there and fall down and have to have the ambulance guys to pick her up.    Yes, we caregivers have a worldfull of guilt.	post_4587454
post_4595172	Jun 24, 2009	529109	547368	Tuckamore	Am I a caregiver? Yes and no. :) I was a caregiver for my 72-yr-old mum before her cancer remission... That was a really draining period, both emotionally and physically. She is better now, and my dad has retired to take over the role as primary caregiver..But that also leaves me as the only one earning an income and also the go-to person whenever a health issue crops up for both of them... As the only child, I find myself having to take a lot of leave from work for their follow-up medical appts for chronic illnesses and other health problems that crop up now and then... It's been really tough to juggle my work with my family responsibilities...Caregiving is one of those tasks that some people don't really think much of if they haven't experienced it, but when they are put into a situation where they have to care for someone who is completely dependent on them, only then will they realise how physically and emotionally exhausting it can get...I think your dad trusts you so much because he knows that he is good hands... You sound really patient and caring from your comments... (none of the anger that we see in some other posts..) He's very lucky to have someone like you... who is still persisting in caring for him, despite his occasional angry outbursts and complaints...Your dad's apprehension abt getting more help could be because he is feeling vulnerable, being ill, and only wants to be looked after by someone whom he can trust completely... And as you said, the previous time you left him with another person, it didn't end very well...Hope you don't mind my two cents' worth... perhaps in your situation, you have to do what's best, not just for him, but for both of you... If you feel that extra help is needed, do try your best to persuade him to allow for other health care workers to visit him... Probably he needs more reassurance from you that the people who are coming to help him are trustworthy and qualified...You might also try to find a way to address your dad's response when he has to see a doctor... Has he always been like this?For my parents, they associate hospitals with illness and they generally have a mistrust of doctors... My mum especially has developed a phobia of doctors and needles after her cancer diagnosis... her teeth will literally be chattering whenever she sees her surgeon, because she's so afraid that he will say something bad...It really takes a lot of patience to convince them that going to see the doctor is necessary and in their best interests... You don't have worry so much abt your dad's guilt trips... At least from what I've learnt... they only lay the blame because they are upset abt their illness and they cannot understand why they are ill... You could let him know that you don't appreciate him laying the guilt... and that although you are sorry that he is ill, it's nobody's fault... these things just happen when you grow old.. to anyone... please don't take his words to heart... it's not your fault...I'm glad that you have a good doctor you are seeing for your pain... Do try to take some time off for yourself... Might it be possible for you to ask another relative to relief you of your responsibilities for a brief period?If you feel guilty abt wanting some respite, tell yourself, you've already done so well for so many years... You deserve some rest...	post_4587454

post_4597548	Jun 25, 2009	547368	None	None	What wonderfully wise ppl I have found here. I am so glad that I posted. And I will not be a stranger. I have years of experience in geriatric nursing but it is so different when you are caring for your loved ones.As I write this I am waiting for a HH Nurse's first visit.(I did that for awhile too but did not enjoy it as much as I did other aspects of nursing.) I have been able to talk him into at least an assessment to ascertain what he qualifies for and how they can make his life easier.He has always avoided doctors and has no respect for most of them and the health care delivery system. So this is not knew but as his condition has deteriorated he has required more and more medical care.I thank you all for you kind words. It's just great to know that I am not alone and there are others that can relate.I have no family members that are willing to relieve me. It's a long story but mu parents were divorced when I was 12 and my brother and sister never really knew Dad as I did (do). I am the oldest by a number of years. This afternoon I will begin my "turn" caring for my elderly mother in my home also. So I will have the two of them for about 3 weeks. At least my sister (next oldest) comes home for a month to 6 weeks and helps with the care of our mother. She is also a nurse but lives 550 miles away.I try not to take the "guilt" trips that both my parents try to lay on me. No I am not angry. I am sad for them and that their lives have come to this. I am in my fifties and God only knows what lies ahead for me. I know that someday in the not to distant future I will not have my parents. That thought is very sad one.And Jo you are right. Out society does not treat the elderly with the respect other nations do. At least they don't wonder into the wilderness to perish when they are no longer productive.I will look forward to chatting with you all again soon. I appreciate your suggestions and will try to apply them.Tuck.	post_4587454

It is important that a power of attorney of healthcare and one over finances be put into place.It will also be important to get an advanced directive in place.The easiest and most comprehensive and holistic approach for an advanced directive is five wishes. You can order it online. It is only $5 for one and it is priceless to have in place. When ordering you should have one for everyone over 18 in your family.i do not know your dad's condition or what the situation is for his living arrangements. If he is at home and requires some care at this point in time? or is he independant ?there are steps you can take. Give me more information and I will try to give you feedback into some other steps you can take.My thoughts and prayers are with you. This is a difficult and emotional time for you.

Perhaps someone to visit your mom once a week or to help with your sister. I've asked a friend of the person for whom I'm primary caregiver and she's come over one day a week so I can have a "free day". It doesn't always work out, but when it does, I've enjoyed being able to go shopping or just take a nice walk without having to wonder if all is well. Stay positive. It really does help. And try to laugh about some of the "funny" things your mom does. She can't help it, of course, but it does help to view the situation with a little humor. All the best to you. j	post_4427982
post_4429028	May 05, 2009	887109	None	kobuk	i have just joined the group and thought I would weigh in. kobuk, you have a very heavy burden that you should not be doing alone. First, have you checked with your state to see what services they offer to assist you with your sister.you are experiencing care giver stress and burnout. You are not taking care of yourself. It is really important that you find time for yourself. This is difficult for many caregivers, especially women, but you need to take care of yourself.You need to allow yourself down time, fun time. time to enjoy. And you need to do it on a regular basis.Think of things on a positive note. Get rid of the "I should" and "I must". instead view things with "I choose" and I need"As far as your mother, she has no control over her condition. what you are feeling is fear and frustration that you cannot control what is happening to her. You may talk to the staff and see if there are times of the day when she is better than other times. You may try to visit during those times, to make it easier on yourself.you should see if there is a support group at the facility that you can attend. It is difficult seeing your mother in her condition. One thing that you may ask the facility is if they have behavior techniques to redirect her. thsy may come up with some solutions that will make you feel less frustrated and fearful.	post_4427982

There is a group that is for caregivers that I should go to for support.    My neighbor is taking care of her elderly mother too and we get together and talk.    (She drinks tho.)    Sometimes I get so frustrated, I wonder who will take care of me.    I have no kids, long term care is so expensive and I have no insurance for that.

As an individual that suffers from clinical depression, it is important to have the ability to vent and talk to others about our feelings. This is the right place for it, as everyone here has a story and no one here is to judge. hang in there. One day the hollering will stop and there will be quiet. you will either find comfort and relief or sorrow and guilt that the yelling disturbed you. As a caregiver we cannot win. this is truly a guilt producing role. hang in there.	post_4427982

You cannot change him, the only thing that you can do is change yourself and how you respond to the situation. He can blame you for everything, but you have to choose to accept that blame.You need to focus on yourself and take car of yourself. take time to figure out just what it is you want out of this relationship and if you want to remain in it. you have a choice to let the unfinished project go, or pay to have someone else to do them. If that is not possible, then you must evaluate what is important to you.you and your spouse are doing a dance. you are dancing around the issues instead of facing them. do you go to any support groups such as ala non or counseling.You are under a tremendous amount of stress and may not be making the best decisions for yourself.    You should consider making yourself and your mental and emotional health a priority.expecting another person to make changes because they attend a group they do not want to attend sounds as if you have unrealistic expectations. get yourself some help and support to help you move forward with your life.Diane Carbo	post_4481892

She should ride in a van type vehicle with a nice reclining seat behind the driver with someone next to her holding her hand constantly. If she has a favorite doll, bring it. Give her, lots of hugs. Even though you may THINK she doesn't understand explain carefully the reason for the trip, how far she is going and how long it will take. If she is nervous you    might ask the physician for a prescription for a valium.    Play her favorite music as you travel and bring a dozen flavors of different beverages and small plastic cups.Hot chicken soup in a thermos. All her meds. Plan rest stops. Bring bananas, and soft snacks. Diapersif needed. In pretty places stop to get out, let her view and talk to her.Avoid air conditioning.

It is coming from my cousins but then it went through my mom and then to me.    And I know my cousins are so close to all of this, that they may be exaggerating a bit or something.    It just does not seem to make any sense.They wanted to know where to go with things.    So basically what I told (or told mom to tell them) was to go to the hospital administration first.    Having reviewed the patients bill of rights posted on the hospital website, this violates them totally.The way I figure it that is the best place to start.    If they are exaggerating, the doctor is being drastic and pushing them, or whatever the case is, the hospital administration should be able to sort this out.I also informed them that she needs to at least be on a nursing home waiting list somewhere so they can tell the administration that they are trying to get her in somewhere.    Although it is a long term care facility, I cannot see them keeping her there forever -- and I assume that may be why they are pushing the family to get her moved somewhere.I have a feeling this will straighten things out more quickly than anything else.Thank you for your help and if they cannot straighten things out, now I know a direction to send them in.	post_4431725

This is like asking Sammy Gravano to ask John Gotti about his last hit.You are going through a lot, and I seem like an arogant interloper to state these things, however they were going to kill my little 104 year old two years ago under similar circumstances, and I physically grabbed the syringe from the nurse and stepped on it, and only the register mail letters to the physicians threatening them with homicide charges (which ended up getting me barred from the hospital) saved her life.

There were many times that I felt so alone and that I was drained.One thing I found was that I actually felt guilty for making time for myself!    But you HAVE to make time for yourself or you will wear down very quickly.I found in my community respite care.    I actually qualified for the help and would have an aide come in to help so I could get out.    See if you have something like this in your community.    Also, can a friend or parent come in for an afternoon on a Saturday so that you can go and pamper yourself?In the evenings, when things settled down, I would go into the living room to read.    It was my time to get away from it all.I hope this helps give you some ideas.    At least you know that someone understands.	post_4397231

I have gone through many care givers, but have finally found 2 wonderful woman, that work in shifts. They are great cooks, and my mom still has a great appetite. She does not like one of them, but I am not going to try and match personalities because she is rather difficult and stubborn even with me.I think you should get a doctors order for 24/7 care. She will do much better in a familiar environment, and you will know you did the best for her. Wouldn't you rather be in your own home?Good luck. This is not an easy job.

Based on your symptoms any good neurologist/Psychiatrist can diagnose dementia.Dementia is a non-specific illness syndrome (set of signs and symptoms) in which affected are: memory, attention, language, and problem solving. Higher mental functions are affected first in the process. Especially in the later stages of the condition, affected persons may be disoriented in time etc. Take care!	post_4491258

And this can be identified with MRI.MRI scan can also help differentiate between different types of Dementia, such as Alzheimer's Disease, Vascular Dementia, etc.On the other hand, there are instances where the MRI may not show any abnormality while the person has symptoms of probable dementia. This may happen in the early stages of Dementia.I hope I could throw some light on this.Regarding your other question ("how is dementia diagnosed") in the same forum -All the symptoms that a person may have are taken into account. The treating physician ( or a Neurologist/Psychiatrist/other specialist) tries to find out if the symptoms fit into any specific category/type of dementia. Accordingly, certain signs of dementia are looked for. This involves assessment of the functioning of brain (memory tests, etc.).Once this initial information is gathered, the physician may order for scans (MRI / PET / etc.) of the brain and some other tests including laboratory tests. All the results are evaluated and a diagnosis is given.I have found a good and simple article for you to read about dementia. It should be enough to get you started on the topic.http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/142214.phpRegardsAbhijeet Deshmukh, MD	post_4491254

What types of treatment did they go through to suppress the growth rate?    My daughter was just diagnosed with FAP and I'm a nervous wreck.    She is 16 years old and is just starting her life. I'm not ready to give her away to FAP.Thanks for your input.Hopeful Mommy....	post_4588136
post_4927524	Sep 30, 2009	872399	1057811	very_hopeful_mommy	Hi, and thank you.    Was your daughter having routine scopes, is this how they discovered she has it? My children were having yearly colonoscopies, due to their father and uncle dying from colon cancer at 32 & 38. They developed colon cancer very close together and this is when we learned it was in the family.    Within 3 months of each other my 12 & 16 year old sons were diagnosed.    Back then there was little known about the disease.    My 12 year old son immediately had his colon removed, and 3 months later my 16 year old son had his removed.    My 12 year old is now 38, as you know people with FAP can develop polyps in the small intestine also.    My son has several which they are watching carefully in his duodenum.    They usually don't become malignant, but there is always that chance. FAP has not slowed him down one bit!    He is a speed hiker, marathoner, ultrathoner, mountain biker and competes in jujitsu.    He is married but has chosen not to have children because of the 50% chance of him passing on the mutation.    My oldest son did not fare as well.    He had one problem after another, but went on to marry and have 2 little boys.    A rare part of FAP is Desmoid Tumors, and once the colon is removed the person should be monitored for the growth of one because surgery or trauma to abdomen can trigger their growth.    Also, puberty, pregnancy, and menopause due to the hormonal changes. They didn't monitor my son and he developed a large desmoid that eventually took him from us at 31.    It's a very long story, but would be happy to share it with you, just let me know. His sons were 6 and 9 when they lost their daddy, and when my oldest grandson was 10 he was dignosed and had to have his colon removed immediately.    Just like his dad, he had one problem after another.    By the time he was 16 he had endured 38 surgeries.    He developed a 38 lb Desmoid which was removed, but he was dying.    With just 10 days left to live, he received a 5 organ transplant.    He suffered tremendously, Stage II organ rejection, had to stay in their apartment for an entire year with nothing to eat by mouth for that year.    He was on TPN where he hooked up to IV's while he slept for his nourishment just as he had watched his dad do for 2 years.    In Nov. he had only 1 surgery left to go and this was to remove his colostomy and ileostomy bags.    His surgeon wanted to wait until after Thanksgiving so that my grandson could enjoy his dinner as he wasn't allowed to have any the year before.    This would still give him time to heal and graduate with his class in June '09.    To look at him you would never know he had endured all that he had.    He was a typical teenager with hopes and dreams for his future.    Right before Thanksgiving he called me because he was really down, missing his dad.    Saying he just wished he were here to toss a football with him.    We talked for about 40 minutes and made plans to go Christmas shopping the following week.    As he was hanging up he said "I love you grandma, and I said "I love you too sweetie."    A few days later he had walked to the corner store and started vomiting blood    He called his mom and when she arrived he was standing in the parking lot still vomiting blood.    Both his bags filled with blood and he passed out.    He was rushed to the hospital where he died, he had bled to death on Dec.1, 2008 at the age of 18. An autopsy had to be performed, but I chose not to hear the results, I want to remember his sweet smile that lit up a room and my heart, and his last words to me. When I had to say good-bye to him, I whispered "heads up sweetie, your dad just threw the ball...." His younger brother still cannot sleep in the bedroom they shared, and he sobbing at night still wakes his mom.    His dad and brother's ashes sit side by side in their living room.    He knows he may face the same fate, and we are all worried about him.    But please know that Desmoids are rare, and the key to FAP is knowledge and vigilence, always.    The mutation has not been located in any of our 5 family members.    I have a daughter who is 37 with a 2 1/2 year old son.    I work with 5 geneticists and although they say she "probably" doesn't have FAP, none will commit.    My grandson's doctor is Professor of Pediatric Gastroenterology@ Cincinnat Children's Medical Center which is the premier unit in the country for this.    He states that if my daughter reaches 40 with no polyps, she can relax knowing that she nor her son have it.    Geneticists agree that until that point we must remain vigilant with her 2 1/2 year old son.    He gets his AFP levels checked every 3 months for the pediatric liver cancer (Hepatoblastoma) also untrasounds until 5.    At that point the geneticists want to re-evaluate how close we need to watch him, if at all. They are still learning so much about FAP and it has so many facets, that everyone is afraid of not being cautious enough.    I don't want my story to scare you.    It is extremely rare to have a cluster of Desmoids like we've had in our family, and even the pediatric liver cancer that babies of a parent with FAP can be born with or develop by age 5 is also very rare.    I've been dealing with this for over 30 years, and everyday in my research learn new things.    They now think that because in about 33% of people with FAP whose mutation cannot be located, that it may be another gene causing the APC gene to malfunction.    This would explain why they are not finding a mutation of the gene in these people.    Everyone who has/had FAP in our family could never have the mutation found.    My surviving son has had 3 tests done, 2 just this year, and still they cannot locate the mutation. Does your daughter have the most common form of FAP or is it the "attenuated form?"    Do you or your husband have FAP, or was this just a spontaneous mutation in your daughter?    I research FAP every day just to try and stay one step ahead of it for my daughter and 2 grandsons. Your daughter must continue to educate herself until she goes through menopause, to keep ahead of the game.    When my husband was diagnosed, I called so many places to find info on it, and the most I could get was a small paragraph out of my doctor's medical textbook.    Back then it was called Gardners Syndrome and was considered an orphan disease, but then they realized it was actually part of FAP.    I know still today, many pediatricians are not aware of it or dentists.    As you know supernumerary teeth can be a symptom, so a dentist would play an important role in early diagnosis    My son has this but nobody knew it was a symptom of anything back then.    Also, opticians play an important role due to the finding of "bear tracks", brown spots in the shape of a bear paw behind the retina during an eye exam. I have only met one other parent whose daughter was born with it.    When she was 5 weeks old her mother was burping her and felt a small lump on her spine.    The grandmother told her not to worry because all babies spines are boney, but this mother had a feeling it was more.    When she took her baby girl for her checkup at 6 weeks, she watched as the pediatrician examined the baby, running his hand over her spine and not noticing the bump.    So she asked him about it.    He said he felt it was just a small fatty tumor, nothing to worry about, but they would run some tests.    It was just the tip of the iceberg.    This little lump was part of a Desmoid tumor!    At 5 months old they tried to remove the tumor, they were only able to get a third of it, taking half her back with it.    This baby has no future.    This is what I mean, FAP varies so much from person to person that you just can't be too careful.    What has happened to your daughter so far?    Please write back to me, it's good to have someone to share this with.    Hopefully, I can help in some way as I've learned more than I ever wanted to know about FAP!    Even Desmoids can be controlled if caught in time, so as long as you,    your daughter and her doctor remain vigilant, she will be fine.	post_4588136

post_4685999	Jul 22, 2009	872399	968206	mukeshaggrawal	Hi, There is no relation between the two, and once the duodenal atresia is corrected and the baby has healed, there are no future problems.    Cystic Fibrosis usually doesn't present with any symptoms until a later age.    The only symptom in a baby is their skin will taste salty when kissed.    If you google, duodenal atresia, and click on the first link, it will give you everything you need to know about CF, and what to expect.    I hope this helps, and blessings to all of you.	post_4656549
post_6680255	Feb 24, 2011	1616183	None	None	I had an operation on a deuodenal-atresia when I was born and didn't really have many problems with it other than stomach pains when I ate certain foods such as curries and fizzy drinks. However when I was sixteen I suddenly got severe stomach pains and began vomiting I was admitted to hospital and eventually the doctors discovered that it scar tissue from my original operation had grown and partially re-obstructed my small intestine. I had further surgery to correct this. I'm not sure how common this is, but that was my experience with deodenal-atresia.	post_4656549
post_4424871	May 04, 2009	505849	None	None	Hi Sartigs,I only found out that I have Marfan's when I was 28, and I am 29 now, but I have come to know quite a bit about it.    I would most definately have to say that you have "minor" and/or "emergent" Marfan's (Emergent meaning it is only now becoming apparent).    I would also suggest that you DO get a cardio exam at least once a year, as well as a slit-lamp test (Especially with your one eye being blind).Having family with Marfan's makes for a much greater probability that you too have it, especially with your "Marfanoid Features".    There is a saying in the Marfan's community...    "Rather a false positive than a false negative".I don't think the medical community has enough resources and/or have done enough studies into the condition to know just how badly it affects a person.    Just because you only have musculo-skeletal and visual complications and no cardio-vascular complications, doesn't make it any less painfull and difficult to deal with as someone with full blown Marfan's.The problem, as I see it, is that the medical profession focuses a lot on the cardio-vascular side of the condition and very little on the other two areas...the two that causes the most pain and discomfort...    The cardio-vascular side can silently kill you...but the other two will drive you to suicide from pain/discomfort...Take care of your self hon, and let me know if you have any questions or need any support.	post_4414849

Unfortunately, the presence of a large hygroma and hydrops is not unusual with Turner's syndrome, but keep in mind it's nothing you did wrong, and sometimes nature has to take it's course, however difficult or unexpected it may be.Give yourself and your boyfriend some time to heal and hold each other close.    Your baby having Turner's syndrome does NOT hurt your chances of eventually having healthy children.    Take good care of yourself, and I wish you all the best in the future.May God bless you and bring you peace.~eureka	post_4367446

Our tests came back clear, we have normal chromosomes.    I have to say I am still a bit scared to produce again as the first one was just so scary.    Anyone have any advise?    I am excited the results are good but what do I do to get myself prepared for pregnancy again?Thanks.	post_4438180
post_4594265	Jun 24, 2009	872399	897572	AnnaTurco	I am so sorry for your loss.    There is no loss worse than that of a child.    We have a genetic disorder in our family that is hereditary.    I would suggest that you meet with a Geneticist to discuss this, since it appears to be an inherited condition.    They can best advise you on your chances of having another child that would have the same problem, and answer any other questions you may have.    Then go from there.    I will pray that you can have more children, blessings to you both.	post_4438180

The doctors have told us that sometimes there are just flukes when it comes time of conseption.    For us it was just a fluke, a very sad and unfortuneate fluke.    But we should be able to get pregnant again and hopefully the odds will be in our favor for the next one.Each day is a new day, and I take each day to share my story to show strength to other mothers and families who have been through similar situations.    In the beginning I couldn't help but think that I was the only one and questioned as to why did it have to happen to us.    But as time has passed I have found that there are alot of people even people and friends close to us who have also endured a similar expirence.    It is a blessing to have such a great support where we are.    I just hope to give continued support to those who need it.Thank you again.	post_4438180

However, her skin is not as stretchy as yours, though.    Is your skin velvety??She is scheduled to see a geneticist very soon.I hope you don't have this, but if you do, find a good geneticist.

My earlier bloodwork/combined screening gave me 1/15,000 chance for downs.Those are very good numbers we have, so I wouldn't get too upset just yet.    Are you doing an amnio?    My dr. isn't suggesting one, besides it's a little too late for me to have one and the risks associated with amnio are a little higher with twins.We're also having a cystic fibrosis screening done on me and my hubby, as this could be related to that as well. We actually just found out that I am a carrier for CF, and we're waiting on my husband's bloodtest to come back.    ~~~nervous~~~My situation/findings are a little different from yours but I just wanted you to know that I can relate and I know how scary all this is.

post_4576164	Jun 18, 2009	872399	921782	mistydawn1979	Men who beat their wife have usually been raised by an abusive father towards their mother.    It is something that can be corrected, and should be.    For some reason it makes a man feel powerful to hit a woman, when it is only his own insecurities he is trying to build up.    But no woman should tolerate this for one second, or make excuses.    Physically abusive men usually will make it out to be the woman's fault, as he accepts no blame himself, or responsibility.	post_4513358
post_4576138	Jun 18, 2009	872399	914095	lildarlin88	Hi, I have had 5 people in my family diagnosed with FAP.    Four of which have passed away.    The most recent was my son at 31, and then his son at 18.    My boys were diagnosed at the age of 12 & 16 (deceased).    Colon cancer did not take my son and grandson, but rather a Desmoid Tumor in their abdomen, as you know this can be part of the disease.    My youngest who was diagnosed at 12, is a very healthy 38 year old today, although he does a a few polyps in his duodenum which they are watching.    Although it is rare for these to become malignant, it does happen.    My son is checked yearly.    I have studied this disease for many years, and am constantly learning.    You really need to find a way to get your tests, this is not something you can ignore.    What is the problem with your insurance?    I have helped people get all types of testing covered by their insurance.    If you don't have insurance, are you eligible for a medical card through Medicaid?    Is there a clinic in your town you can go to?    If all else fails, I'm sure you could find a GI doctor who would work something out with you knowing the seriousness of this.

post_4461931	May 14, 2009	897572	904231	a41983	I understand your fear, I too lost my child.    He was born with the rare Trisomy 16q+, which is the number one cause of miscarriages.    He wasn't supposed to make it full term, but did.    I had an emergency c-section a month early to only have him for a week.    It's been a real scary time for us as well, there are not alot of cases of what our son had and all the cases we have found have ended in death.    We are still fresh in the loss as it's only been 3 months.    He was our first, my husband and I have been through some genetics tests to see if we are carriers of this disorder, the results just came in clear and normal, so what our son had was just a fluke, a very rare fluke.    I take our loss as a blessing to have him even for just a moment.    Hearing that you have a healthy child, gives me hope that you and I will be able to have other healthy children someday.    I believe that we are given situations to help and grow from them, I am sorry I didn't have an answer to your question of starting again.

To me the true father is whoever it is who takes over the role of father to this child. There is no way for you to know for sure without genetic testing, but unless this is a huge issue with your husband (if you have told him) then maybe this wouldn't be necessary because it might only bring more pain. If you are able, if you aren't now you might be later, to put this mistake behind you and focus on this child as being both yours and your husbands, because he would be the only father your child would know. This is my take on the situation for what it's worth! Good Luck!	post_4488623

post_4434745	May 06, 2009	574521	None	WORRIED MOM	same issue with me- Tested positive for Lupus anticoagulant and low Protein S. Can anybody tell me what the results mean? My dr is closed for the day and I just picked up the    results from my lab...	post_4433606
post_4436728	May 07, 2009	693865	None	Guestito	Hi,I don't know how it all works but the low protein s means you are more likely to develop a blood clot and the lupus anticoagulant also makes you more prone to clot. It does not mean you are more likely to develop lupus, it was just named lupus anticoagulant. So you have 2 genes that will make you a higher risk than normal to develop a blood clot.I hope this helps!	post_4433606
post_4438581	May 07, 2009	574521	693865	WorriedMom15	Thanks!!Im furious right now.... My Dr. decided not to put me on any meds just folic acid even after testing positive for blood clotting!!!    He thinks my clotting is not too bad and with just the folic acid should be sufficient... Im not very happy right now. ( I have had 2 miscarriages back to back)	post_4433606
post_4439210	May 07, 2009	693865	None	Guestito	If I were you, I would go to another Dr. for a second opinion. My sister-in-law had numerous miscarriages and when they finally figured out she had a blood clotting disorder, they put her on Heparin and she had delivered twins, full term, with no problems throughout the pregnancy. Maybe try to find a Dr. that specializes more in blood clotting disorders and pregnancy.Good Luck and I hope you are able to find some answers!!!	post_4433606

Russian, Czech or Polish) have genetic ties with the Mongols which can often be noted in the physical attribute that you described. Perhaps, you have a genetic connection with these cultures? Native Americans of North America also have a deep ancestral Mongolian connection... and, there are many native American tribes in Canada as well as in the U.S. Maybe, you have Native American blood.	post_4372957
post_4417011	May 01, 2009	868088	876864	JohhnyB	This trait could be the result of an infinite number of factors.    (As above) Do you know if you have any ancestral ties to any aboriginal culture?    Furthermore, if this is eating away at you, and you crave further knowledge on the topic, there are genetic clinics available for such queries.    This is more advantageous because the geneticist has the luxury of appearance.    Of course, price notwithstanding.Even universal health care beneficiaries must pay for such curiosities.    However, a friendly family physician may find a way to finagle your way into a free appointment.    Or, even a random "pop-in" may further enlighten you on this subject.    It never hurts to ask your local experts.	post_4372957

post_4893750	Sep 21, 2009	535822	1046298	codebreaker	I dont know the odds but I would venture that ist doubtful you have Alzheimers, are you on any meds as some do have side effects and one of them is short term memory loss, also mood swings. If you dont take meds do you take any herbs or supplements, sometimes anxiety can make you forget things. Do you rush around, driven... doing many activities and jobs, as that can    make you not concentrate on any one thing. You do sound stressed so some relaxation may be in order, do you have fun, thats a very important part of life ..	post_4890389
post_4917873	Sep 28, 2009	1055396	None	None	I have lived with a poor memory since I was 20. Every place that I worked at I have been involved in incidents where people get angry with me because of memory loss, however I always managed to stay employed as an accountant and am now 55 and retired, afraid to go back to work because of recent memory loss. The problem of increasing memory loss did not occur to me until recently so you may never have any increased memory loss, if you even have any now.The finger pain is probably a pinched nerve which will not repair. Pinched nerves have no relationship to memory issues, they just occur.Many people have mood swings, so for you that may just be a matter of needing some therapy to deal with. A study of people with physical aggression issues determined that those people do not have trouble maintaining composure when they are in the presence of someone they feel physically afraid of.You should talk to your doc or a professional for clarification about all your concerns, as people on this board can only provide background info.	post_4890389

First of all I understand the dilemma your in, I can only recommend a couple of things.    Don't feed into his rants and raves, try redirecting the conversation with something he is interested in.    Redirecting a person is our main way of dealing with patients that are out of control.	post_4735139

post_4738230	Aug 06, 2009	994742	637356	Lonelymom	Hi,My dad has dementia and it is not too out of control yet, but one thing you always have to tell yourself is that they are not doing this intentionally, I know that being a caregiver you are very overwhelmed and sometimes you are too tired to remind yourself that your grandpa's thoughts and accusations are not rational to you, but to him they are.I constantly have to tell my mom not to get frustrated with him, but it is easy for me to say when I do not have to deal with it all the time. So I hope that maybe hearing someone else say that your reaction to him is how alot of caregivers react, hang in there and remember we do not know how much time we have with them, so enjoy the good and the sometimes not so good. One thing you should maybe do yourself is have your grandpa's doctor tell him that he cannot drive, that is what my mom did, that way he will see it as a medical reason, not because you and your mom are telling him to stop.Good Luck and take care	post_4735139
post_4738760	Aug 06, 2009	637356	994742	Vako23	Thank you and yes he will be seeing a new doctor next week. We plan to have it medically diagnosed here in Texas since he has been in South Carolina and all the signs point to him having not the first stages but more like the later stages. Sometimes he thinks I am my mom and sometimes my daughter is my mom. He believes my aunt is dead and my grandma is dead then other times he thinks he is divorced to my grandma and neither are true. She lives in Washington with other family and has lived there since she moved there to take care of her mom. They never got divorced. My aunt is very much a live and living only 1 1/2 hours away from us but never comes down or calls anymore.I think until we get the diagnoses I am going to remove the ecm fuse from his car that way he can't start the car. He will believe someone stole the gas out of it and he won't have an oppurtunity to drive.	post_4735139
post_4808706	Aug 26, 2009	1018077	637356	Lonelymom	Hi!!    My dad has dementia.    He repeats the same joke or story over and over again.    We didn't really realize he was getting bad until last summer, he was asked to pray.    He prayed, but it lasted about 15 minutes or more.    He prayed about everything...but the food.    It was funny at the time, but that was just the beginning of the decline.    He still recognizes everyone.    He drives my mom crazy, by asking the same question over and over again.    It is really harmless, but it does get on your nerves.Well, I hope the best for you in your situation.	post_4735139
post_4808761	Aug 26, 2009	637356	1018077	DarBaby2009	The repeating doesn't bother me as much as him accusing us of tearing up stuff he tore up or claiming we stole something he can't find! Now that bothers me.For instance just recently he opened my mom's bedroom window that had the ac in it and dropped the AC unit about 8 feet out her bedroom window. Then he put it on a dolly and wheeled it in the office and tried to put it back together. When my mom noticed it was broke he claimed me and my 3 year old daughter opened the window and pushed it out. Very frustrating to me.	post_4735139
post_4864955	Sep 12, 2009	676326	637356	Lonelymom	You could call the authorities about his driving license. The call goes as anonymous, which is what I did to my father-in-law while his kids hoped he would improve. Him sticking his car keys into wall sockets was proof of no hope, yet his doctor had just approved him as safe to be driving at the time I got involved.Sounds like you solved it taking the fuse out, as long as he does not take it to a service station.	post_4735139

post_5069945	Nov 11, 2009	1102302	637356	Lonelymom	Hmmmm... I've never really thought about redirecting the conversation.    I'll have to try that & suggest it to my family.    My 82 year old grandfather was diagnosed with Alzheimer's a few years ago, & we're going through a lot the same stuff the OP mentioned.    My hubby's grandmother also has what I believe to be undiagnosed Alzheimer's, because she has almost the exact same symptoms my grandfather does.    And having worked with elderly people (working for the housing authority & as a property manager) I've noticed that the accusations of theft are a pretty common thing.    And it's always for silly things, like toothpaste, canned foods, etc.    As difficult as it is, you just have to overlook it.My grandfather is still somewhat lucid, but he is constantly getting me confused with my mother & asking me if I remember things that actually happened to my mother as a kid instead of me.    His doctor's said his disease appears to be pretty far advanced, & they think the reason he still remains somewhat lucid is because he has been a farmer all his life, & this has helped him to establish a routine.    Fortunately I live 30 miles away from him, & he lives on his farm with my mother, grandmother, & uncle.    My mother & uncle live in 2 seperate houses within walking distance of my grandmother & grandfather.    Unfortunately, my grandmother gets the brunt of his frustration.    He is constantly cursing her, yelling at her, accusing her of cheating (he's the only man she's ever been with), has told her he's talked to an attorney about getting a divorce (they've been married 50+ years) & hiding things from her.    She writes his doctor's appts. down on a calender, & he will sneak around & erase them or mark through them.    He's told myself & my uncle that we will all be dancing on his grave when he dies because all we want from him is his money, which makes no sense, since he technically doesn't have any money, just the farm which isn't exactly a liquid asset.    My hubby & I keep our horses on the farm & we were switching them from pasture to pasture when the cattle would switch pastures.    When I was a child, we only kept the horses in one pasture (nicknamed the "horse lot"), & my grandfather threw such a fit about the horses not being in the horse lot that my uncle (who takes care of the farm) ended up fencing them in there so he won't have to listen to him complain.    He's absolutely refuses to let us put them anywhere else, even through their placement on the farm has absolutely zero effect on him.    So I'm constantly having to worry about whether they have enough water & grazing land to sustain them.    He also continues to drive, even though he's been told not to my his docs.    It wouldn't be so bad if he just drove on the farm, but anytime my grandmother goes somewhere, he will get in his truck to drive to wherever she is to check up on her to make sure she is not cheating!    This concerns me greatly, as I had a friend whose grandfather did the same thing & ended up crashing into a mother & her small child, almost killing them.    I've been told to call the authorities about his driver's license, but my husband tells me I shouldn't because his riding around is "all he has", since he can't work the farm anymore due to his various health problems.    My grandmother has said that when he gets to the point to where he doesn't know any of us, she's going to put him in a home.    I feel horrible about that, but on the other hand I think his behavior is really taking a toll on her.     He recently had an episode with his heart & was in the hospital (where he angrly, violently insisted someone be with him at all times, to the point where he was put in restraints) & I actually took some comfort in that because I know she'd get a break.My husband's grandmother has never drove, thank goodness, but we have to deal with a whole other host of problems with her.    Such as, her furnace is about to blow up, the neighbor is a state trooper who's spying on her (the guy works at some factory somewhere), the HVAC who came to repair her furnace is stalking around her house at night with a gun trying to kill her, we're all conspiring to put her in the nursing home, she doesn't want to go to doctor's appts. because she thinks the doctor will put her in the nursing home, & from time to time she will even try to sort out her weekly & daily medicines herself, which results in nothing but chaos.So Lonelymom, you're not alone.    There's all sorts of us having to go through this.    One thing I've learned is that you can't use reason & logic with them; it will not work.    TRUST ME.    Some of my family members try to do that with my grandfather & my husband's family members try to do the same thing with his grandmother, & it only results in everyone getting angry & frustrated & nothing getting resolved.    I've never really known of anything else to to do, though, as you can't go along with them when they're accusing of people trying to murder them & whatnot!    That's why I liked the early suggestion of redirecting the conversation.     I'll suggest to my family members & try it myself.    I'm sick of going around in circles with my grandfather trying to convince him that my grandmother never has & never will cheat on him.	post_4735139
post_5069985	Nov 11, 2009	1102302	None	None	And oh yes, I forgot to mention, the humor thing, sometimes that's the best way to deal with it.    I'm always cracking up at my husband's grandmother & her fear that the furnace is going to explode.    And then she decided the HVAC man who was trying to kill her is now in prison for some reason, so we just told her that that meant she didn't have to worry about him anymore.It's a bit more difficult to find humor with my grandfather, though.    He seems to be very emotional & cries easily.    I can give him a card for father's day & he will cry.    He cries when he starts talking about when my cousin & I were children.    My uncle is a bit more casual about it, though, & even remarked to me one day in a sarcastic voice "Well, you know how he *cries* about everything", when I was asking him something about my grandfather (can't remember what).    The fact that he didn't take it so seriously helped me to lighten up a bit.    We also get a bit of a laugh about his cheating accusations towards my grandmother & that he keeps claiming to have spoken to a divorce attorney.     My uncle actually called his bluff on that one day, & he hasn't said anything about it sense.I realize it's difficult, & I couldn't imagine being with my grandfather 24/7.    Hopefully some of the advice that has been given here today will help you to cope better.	post_4735139

post_4918353	Sep 28, 2009	1055396	None	None	I live in Calgary. Transition Therapeutics has a promising drug that actually regrows the brain in mice, and may elect early to go into a Phase 3 trial next year, if they get start to get encouraging results from a P2 trial that is scheduled to take a year or so to conclude. It will be the only drug that repairs, should it work.It is very early stage though, so don't get your hopes too high since there has been bad news in testing of other potential Alzheimer treatment drugs recently.	post_4917755

post_4923740	Sep 29, 2009	1055396	None	None	I see they just filed today with the Securities Commission that they will raise $75 million, so it is possible that they have some good results in Phase 2 and plan to go into a Phase 3 trial. Phase 3 is super expensive.The stock analyst said last month that they might jump into a Phase 3 trial before Phase 2 was completed if the interim P2 results were promising, so let's hope that is what happened. I do not own any shares and am just taking a guess about what they will be doing with the $75 M.Even if it works though, it won't work for all. Just look at all the antidepressants that exist because there is no drug that can work for all.	post_4917755

post_4798134	Aug 23, 2009	1009042	401219	Angela77	Dear Angela,I just recently joined and posted here too. I am not new to this because my Mom was about the same age as your Mom when she got the diagnosis. They were not super clear they said it could be Alzheimers, dementia, Memory loss from Atrophy to her brain from many TIA's( mini strokes)    They could not say how fast it will progress, if and when it will progress.Our mother went on Aricept 10mg and has been on that dose for 9 -10 years not exactly sure. She had done rather w ell on that dose.2 and half years ago she had a bad UTI and we were not sure if along w//that another TIA she went to a home with Physical therapy. She was unable to jump thru the hoops that Medicare insisted she jump thru in the time frame they say. We were upset and wanted to pay for more PT on our own to help her. The MD sat us down and told us that we were being cruel and that he truly felt she had Vascular Dementia. That it can go very slowly and then all of a sudden progress quickly. That while a year ago she rallied rather quickly and did great w/ PT this time she was in    much worse shape!All of these conditions are all so very close to the same thing as "Alzheimers"    They cannot really know if OUR MOM'S have Alzheimers till after they are passed and can dissect the brains. So for now it's    a matter of finding medications. Activities to help her keep what she has now working. (doing    crosswords, reading, other things to keep her brain active)We had alot harder time because Our Mom had to go home and be bed ridden. We were told she would not be able to get out again. We have a lift at home.If you can get your Mom out to keep her active I am, sure that is helpful!I didn't ever get a support group. You are smart. I felt Our Mom's progressed usually very slow so I didn't go talk to anyone. I sort of figured anything they would tell me at that point would just scare me and make me worry and for how long?Now I am, at the stage I need support. I believe this is what is considered end stages.Basically Angela I wanted to let you know it can be a very slow process. You may have many good years left. I would get her on some medication though. I believe it helps.Hope this was of some help.	post_4795280

post_4782221	Aug 18, 2009	1009042	None	None	You should try to get second or third opinions with neurologists till you get an explanation that makes sense.My mother had some of the things you said you experienced. She was young too. She has had quite a few    TIA's.(so they say) we have noticed a few    in the past few years.    Prior she just had alot of UTI's and would get dingy and wind up in the hospital. They would just tell us sometimes people who are hospitalized get this sort of dementia when they wind up hospitalized.Later a Medicare MD told us she had Vascular Dementia and out of all the MDs this was the one diagnosis that made the most sense.If you have Blood pressure issues and high cholesterol, or diabetes these things could affect you I suppose. They did with my Mom.Even messed up or lacking female hormones can mess with you.All of us get forgetful but yours sounds much more than forgetful.I would not rest till someone could figure out why you have atrophy in your brain and what you can do. Maybe Aricept is something that would be helpful for you.I wish you luck.	post_4672309

Blood carries oxygen to all parts of our body, without out it our extremities (the first effected) will begin to mottle. The cardiovascular system is not functioning as efficiently as it once did. All of the bodies systems slowly begin to shut down as we expire.I have watched a lot of ppl expire and I have not noticed a crease in their ears. Ears do crease as we age. I would venture to guess that if you noticed a crease it was do to that fact or again the lack of blood supply and/or possible some dehydration.Tuck	post_4775901

As for the morphine, it's the same opiate as in oxycontin and oxycodone, only it gets into the system faster. If the physician has nor prescribed a TENS electrical pain control device, ask him. They sometimes work as well as the opiates. I say "sometimes", but they are worth a try. The only down side is that they only offer palliative care. That lets out certain treatments that in some cases offer a very slim hope for remission.	post_4999039
post_5014183	Oct 26, 2009	547368	None	None	Thanks Jo and Caregiver for your input.Hospice has started. Thus far the team has been very good. I only had one incident with one RN. I've taken care of my father in my home for 6 years in addition being at his side and providing care and support for ten years prior to him coming to live with us. I've been a nurse for many years. I know him like you most ppl know their children. I've also worked closely with patients and their families as they went through the death and dying process. One of the RN's talked down to me and treated me as if I knew nothing about my father or the medications he is prescribed. Before they arrived in my home I was his sole caregiver.You are both right they have not made him take the morphine. He is on oxycodone and Oxycontin that relieves his back pain but does not aid in his breathing. Liquid morphine seems to help in that area but he is a stubborn man and has refused it all but 3 times. He has rights and I can only offer. He denies it helps him but I can visually see that it calms him and allows him to breath better. His O2 sats improve on it also.I am here all the time so I am able to monitor them. I too would not tolerate anyone raising their voice at him. I'm sorry that that happened to your daughter Jo. Losing a child must be an awful tragedy and my heart goes out to you. How cruel and unkind that caregiver was to your daughter. We all have to have hope or a dream. I am glad that you reprimanded her and that your daughter was able to have a kinder group. I have promised my father a trip to a warmer climate in mid winter, such as FL if his health permits. In my heart I highly doubt that will not happen but it gives him something to look forward to and to dream about and that is important right now.He is very strong willed and determined and I think we have a long road ahead of us. My goal is to care for him at home as long as I can physically do so and make the remainder of his life as comfortable as possible. I admit I need the support of an agency but if they can not follow his wishes than I will be forced to continue to do this alone.So far so good with Hospice but it is very early. Again thank you for your input.Blessings to both of you.Tuck	post_4999039
post_4835690	Sep 03, 2009	144586	None	None	First of all, there is no valid reason that an airline will not allow, with previous arrangements, an E cylinder on board an aircraft.Al alternative is an oxygen concentrator, which generally runs on 115 V AC. You then need an accessory to the car battery that will convert the 12 volts to 115 volts. They atren't too expensive.Remember when handling oxygen it is hypergolic, which means it bursts into flame when in contact with oil or grease.You also might consider AMTRAK.	post_4818888

Recently the FAA approved use of personal onboard oxygen with equipment manufactured by Airsep Corp and a company called Inogen.	post_4818888

Your county seat should have a community action program or human services department (they are called different things in different parts of the country) that can best direct you.Have help with your selection. Some facilities are better than others and offer better services. Many have special or specific focuses and you will want one that best suits your loved ones needs.Best of Luck,Tuckamore	post_4821929
post_4798498	Aug 23, 2009	547368	None	None	Hi Barbsister,I am so sorry that your sister is expiring and you are suffering with her. It is so very difficult to deal with death and dying when it is someone that we love so much. My father has end stage lung disease and I am caring for him in my home/ And though he is not literally dying right now he is deteriorating fast.When ppl are not able to get sufficient oxygen to their brain it does not function normally, not do our other organs. This causes confusion, disorientation and obviously lack of judgement among other symptoms and issues. In addition to the lack of oxygen I assume they are also providing your sister with medications to keep her as comfortable as they can, this often includes narcotics and/or anxiety medications. Those medications can also add to the dysfunction of her thought process.There isn't a lot you can do. I would venture a guess that your sister is not even aware that she called you last night or possibly doesn't even recall the names she called her x-boyfriend. Do you live close enough that you can visit her. She may very well have lucid moments and you could be there to comfort her. If you cannot visit than ask to be called when she is alert and you can also call her to just to listen to and support her.Have you spoke with the nurses or her physician? If she has named you as someone that can obtain information they can provide you with a better picture of what may be happening. I am only guessing.Your sister is fortunate to have a caring sister in you. My heart goes out to you as well as your her. I am sorry for the pain that you both must be experiencing. We are here to chat if that helps and we are here to support you. Please let us know how you are doing.Take Care,Tuck	post_4797801
post_4666172	Jul 16, 2009	547368	None	None	Hi Kalily,I think it was a wise decision to join the Celebrate Recovery Support Group. At least it sounds like you are getting out and obtaining some support from others in a similar situation. We all need that.There are major differences between manic, schizophrenic, bi-polar and depression. May I respectfully suggest that he be seen by a good Gerontologist. These physicians specialize in the physical, mental, and social changes in people as they age. Often they work hand in hand with other supportive fields and in your husbands case that could mean a Geriatric Psychologist or Psychiatrist. If he is correctly diagnosed it is possible that there is a treatment for his condition and symptoms. And that could mean you will have your husband back or at least an acceptable similarity of him. It could also offer you some counselling in ways to deal with what you are facing.I am blessed that my husband is still a wonderful supportive companion and still maintains an active professional career at 65. For five years I have been the caretaker of my 80 year old father who in the last nine months has become more argumentative, dictatorial and angry. He is deteriorating and is in heart failure and end stage lung disease. 65% of the time I also the caretaker of my 76 year old mother. They were divorced when I was 12 so it can be very interesting.I don't have a lot of answers for you but if you are able to leave your husband alone for any length of time I encourage you to join more activities. Because it sounds like you belong to a church you may want to become involved with other church groups.If your husband cannot offer you an intelligent, adult conversation or companionship you might consider attending a craft class at your local community college or take that class on a subject that you have always been interested in learning more about.If he can't be left alone investigate what your local community has to offer for home health or day care services. Do you have children or does he have siblings that would be willing to sit with him while you get out of the house?My heart goes out to you. Although I have a wonderful husband I have little time for him and almost no quality time. I miss him terribly. I'm sure you miss the active husband you had at one time.Others will post that can offer their suggestions. If chatting with someone helps I would be glad to chat with you. Feel free to send me a PM. Don't forget to take care of yourself.Tuck	post_4665174
post_4842468	Sep 05, 2009	585414	675347	ginger899	I have advanced tardive dyskinesia and have one symptom that might be a cause of what you describe which is dysphasia. As to what treats it, it depends on the underlying cause. Since my disability is clinically similar to Parkinson's, a variety of anti-Parkinsonian medications work to mitigate it. Dementia can caused by a variety of disabilities or diseases that are age related such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or a person having had a stroke. Therefore, if what she has is dysphasia was to be treated the doctors would have to understand where the dementia originated from. She should definitely see an ENT doctor for sure regardless. I know that Namenda was helpful for relatives of mine who had dementia from a variety of causes but I am not sure if it works on dysphasia, more on the actual clinical symptoms of dementia. Also you should work with them to do a check to make sure that her medications are not interacting as that sometimes can cause problems as well and it should be clinically noted, that although medically neccessary, the basic medications for Parkinson's such as Carbo-Dopa/Levo-Dopa do eventually cause tardive dyskinesia but it would depend what is being used and what her specific diagnosis is.	post_4842372
post_4842832	Sep 05, 2009	675347	585414	ILADVOCATE	Thanks so much for such a fast and thorough response.She has been diagnosed with age-related vascular dementia. I've just been researching about this for the past 3 hours. I have found some interesting things.Apparently there is some connection with the Vagus nerve (and brain stem) in her case. She also has an Ovarian Tumor "mass" (no-one is absolutely certain if this is cancer or not without laparoscopy, which because she is so terribly frail, she would not be able to tolerate.) She also has some evidence of liver involvement, and also has a huge aortic aneurysm.-again inoperable because of her extreme frailty.All these put together really mean she is dying. I know that.But strangely whenever she has a blast of cold fresh air on her face, suddenly her symptoms lessen! (not being able to swallow) I found out this stimulates the Vagus nerve temporarily.The only medication she is currently on are: Paracetamol (!) (She had only one low-dose Morphine a week or so ago, and hasn't needed it since)......and Temazepam (for anxiety at night) but not every night.	post_4842372
post_4731285	Aug 04, 2009	875513	992253	Lilscoop	Hi,Your fatherâ  s symptoms suggest of Schizophrenia . That is why Seroquel has been administered . If the drug has not worked or is causing adverse effects , please intimate the doctor and ask him for a drug change .Sedatives alone may not be helpful . His symptoms of Schizophrenia need to be treated . Please consult a physician or a    Schizophrenia specialist . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !	post_4730888
post_4732348	Aug 04, 2009	992253	None	Dr Rajgopal	Why do you believe he may be suffering from Schizophrenia?    I've never heard of someone becoming Schizophrenic in their 90s.    Up until he was 91, he was mentally very healthy, but at 91 or so we noticed he would say a few strange things here and there, but not often.    This past year his confusion has increased, particularly the past 3 months I'd say, along with delusions and some paranoia (boyfriends for my mom)    and a few hallucinations here and there, but not that often.    From what I'm researching, those symptoms would be typical for someone suffering from dementia of the multi-infarct type, which he has been diagnosed with June, 08.	post_4730888
post_4749858	Aug 09, 2009	373175	992253	Lilscoop	I've experienced something similar with my mom.    She is 86 and has dementia (her MRI shows that she has had multiple small strokes which have caused the dementia. )Sometimes she has very bizarre, distorted ideas ( for example, thinks people are plotting to steal things like pennies in the house and are communicating with walkie-talkies to pull this off).    The doctor prescribed Zyprexa, knowing that she has dementia.    It helped some, but I've had people who work with the elderly question why she was put on an anti-psychotic for dementia.	post_4730888
post_4752167	Aug 10, 2009	13274	None	None	Your father should not be on Seroquel, this is commonly believed.    Instead, last year some Canadian scientists discovered that an anti-epilepsy drug, Depakene which is also called Valporic Acid (I think that's how it's spelled), stops the plaques that form in the brain which leads to dementia.    In addition, it should help him sleep better.    That particular medicine will sometimes deplete Folic Acid in the body, so he should have that as a supplement.    VPA also goes by several other trade names.Also, since your dad wants to get out of bed more, then I reckon that will have to be arranged for him, everybody gets bored stuck in bed.    I know, it's that he can't get himself out of bed, so just increase how much he gets up, and if you have to, roll his bed out of his room.    If you can get him outside, that will really help him a whole lot, grounds a person and helps them feel more normal.    I hope you have enough help around you while he's recovering from his fall.    And I hope your docs will try that medicine.    I take an anti-convulsant and it's for a completely different reason than what the drug is normally used for.	post_4730888
post_4753062	Aug 10, 2009	992253	None	None	Thanks so much for the advice.    It's now been 1 1/2 weeks since he's release from the hospital.    He is gaining a bit more strength with the help of occupational therapists that come to the home.    We've been getting him out of bed as much as we can, including to do outside, but it is so hot he prefers to stay in, but the rooms are all light and bright and airy.    It's only at night when he is put in the hospital bed that he becomes aggressive and agitated about not being able to get out of the hospital bed.    He says he's "chained up" and we have no right to do so.    Of course, he does realize there are no physical chains, but since he cannot get himself out of the bed, that's how he sees it.    I spent much time speaking with him yesterday about this.    He recognizes if he were to get himself out of bed at night on his own (no caregiver after 9:00 PM) he doesn't have the strength in his legs to hold himself up and he'll fall.    Yet, he insists this should be his decision and he should not be placed in a bed that prevents him from getting out of it.    Ugh.    We stopped the Seroquel a few days ago.    I even called the company who makes Seroquel and they said one has to balance the risks vs the benefits of using the drug and many doctor's prescribe it for off label use, i.e. dementia with psychosis, dispite the block box warning.    Even a hospital program for the elderly said this is a common drug they prescribe for their elderly clients with good success.    That's just amazing, knowing one can die from this medication.    Now we have him on Xanex at night.    Tried .5 mg, but he was still agitated.    Upped it to 1 mg at night.    We'll see if they helps alleviate the agitation.    Hope so.    I'll research the other drugs described above.    Thanks so much for the suggestions.    His psychosis seems to be worse in the later afternoon (even though it's fully bright outside), but even with the psychosis, he is aware he's being put in the hospital bed at night.    At first we thought he was agitated from the psychosis, but now we see he is aware of more than we thought he was.    Hard to keep straight what he realizes and what he doesn't, especially when he speaks about his childhood as though it's current.    This is such a bizzare medical condition.	post_4730888
post_4753221	Aug 10, 2009	999692	None	lilscoop	I have heard mention of medications and such, but is he seeing a therapist? I suffer from bi-polar and for some reason the psychosis does become worse in the evening due to association with negative things occurring in the evening. He may be demented, but there are still things that can be done psychologically, especially if he's aware, even to some extent. Working with his perception of reality and around his condition would be incredibly helpful to his quality of life.	post_4730888
post_4753261	Aug 10, 2009	998380	None	None	Hmmmm. First off Seroquel at such a low dose wouldnt do anything for hallucinations anyway. Secondly its proven that seroquel given in cases of dementia only makes matters worse. Health care providers are so eager to give out that and other drugs in its class (i.e Zyprexa, Risperdal) for every sneeze and sniffle (metaphorically speaking of course). I am convinced that most doctors who perscribe these meds have no idea what they are doing. A few years back i was suffering from severe anxiety and a doctor put me on Luvox and Seroquel, two drugs which i found through researching after being on them, should not be taken at the same time.Dementia and Schizophrenia although both thought disorders are on two totally different sides of the spectrumDementia is a degenerative disorder in which neural transmissions arent always recieved properly or completely due to degeneration and damage of receptors and sender neurons. It isnt due to chemical imbalances.Schizophrenia and other delusional thought disorders are thought to be    caused by over stimulation in dopamine pathways in the frontal lobe of the brain, resulting in bizarre thoughts and hallucinations. Antipsychotic drugs partially block the flow of dopamine to dampen signals and lessen activity in these areas.To give a person a drug which dampens thought transmissions in a disease where signals are already being recieved incompletely makes no sense. It scares me that these are the people that take care of us and our loved ones.	post_4730888
post_4756382	Aug 11, 2009	13274	992253	Lilscoop	Dear Lil,I loved your new post with all the info on how your Dad is getting so much good assistance, I could picture vividly how things are there at your home.    You're doing great with him.    Let's see, one thing you COULD try, on explaining the nighttime bed stuff, is (A) tell him you've "decided: he CAN get out of bed at night if he wants to, and (B) ask him to lift his arms up in the air, and then his legs, and say, "See, you are not tied down," and (C) THEN tell him the reason he's struggling to get out of bed is because he has an injury, and point to the place where he hurt himself before, and (D) then ask him to please get out of bed and come with you.    Hopefully when he hears all this in sequence, followed by of course not being able to get out of bed, a lightbulb will go off in his head, and maybe he won't get so rambunctious.    And then I think I'd quickly turn his attention to a book or magazine or the TV, and yourself share and show some interest in it, so HE'LL get interested, and that way you switch the subject.This is how they do dogs that get frustrated and bored in the house and start to chew furniture (akin to your Dad yelling and so forth).    They REDIRECT the dog's attention from his frustration to something he can "take it out on," which is a bone (nylabone).    Magazines or whatever you can come up with, that will be his bone.    In other words, try to train your Dad to get over his need to get up by replacing it with something he likes to do in bed, to keep his mind occupied until he falls to sleep.    Plus, if he gets a drug that will help him sleep, he SHOULD get to where almost as soon as he lays down, he'll pass out.But it sounds like you've gotten some good info here at this forum, and it sounds like you have indeed done a lot of really good things for him, and I'm sorry you have to deal with this bedtime thing.    As for him spending time in his childhood, that might be another "bone" to throw him when he gets upset, since he likes the subject so much.    Many older people like to talk at length about stuff that happened when they were younger, because those are the memories that stay the longest and are easiest to retrieve, as the memory fails them from time to time.    In the end, I really think once this injury heals, he'll be a lot better in a very short time.GG	post_4730888

It should be noted however that most people that are HLA-B27 positive never develop any diseases associated with the gene, so it is possible to have it and never know about it.What is meant by a gene skipping a generation is that it is actually there in the genome of the "skipped" individual but silent, that is, itÂ s effect cannot be seen. As mentioned above this is most often the case with HLA-B27. This individualÂ s child might then inherit the gene and be affected by it. A child cannot inherit a gene straight from a grandparent. A parent must have it in his or her own genome in order to pass it on to the next generation.	post_4922316

She is 10 months old right now and although we have had some medical issues to overcome this year she will be a normal little girl she is hitting all of her milestones and has a fantastic personality and she is absolutely beautiful.    I can't believe a doctor would tell you to terminate.    She may be a little short and    she will have to face the choice of adopting a child or trying ivf to have a family when she is ready to, but your daughter will be the light of your life.    Turners Syndrome is no big deal at all,    it is just a part of who she is.    There are many facebook groups for turners syndrome girls and parents and I have found them to be a wonderful source for us.    Looking up Turners syndrome online can be scary but you will see real girls and real parents in these groups on facebook and you can ask questions or just read other peoples questions and comments.Girls with Turners syndrome grow up to be successful women, pediatricians, artists,    lawyers, teachers, or anything they want to be, and they are strong and beautiful.I hope this helps you,Lizzie	post_4886490

post_7957729	May 16, 2012	2168261	1044769	Alexts	HiI have read your post and being in a very similar situation was hoping that you would be able to tell me the outcome of your pregnancy.I am 20 weeks pregnant (next scan in two days). I am pregnant with our first baby who was diagnosed with 8% Turners cells (mosaic) following an amniocentesis. We had an ultrasound at 16 weeks and all looked fine. No defects visible. We have been presented with the facts in a way that shows a positive outlook due to low amount of abnormal cells, no defects on scan and nuchal fold measurement is minimal. They made us aware that we would need to look out for her height/growth around 5 and then later on keep an eye on her puberty development.I am beside myself with worry about making sure i understand exactly how much she would be at risk of suffering with Turners syndrome symptoms/health issues.Although the health professionals have made it sound very positive - on reseraching the condition etc am i right in thinking there realy is no way of telling how much she would or would not suffer with any of the symptoms related to Turners syndrome.We have not been offered genetic counselling - i am struggling to understand what is going on. I am unable to relax and enjoy preganancy or prospect of becoming a Mum with this unknown outcome of how much our baby will be affected. I feel so so very guilty that i am still wondering if we should terminate the pregnancy.Jeanette	post_4886490

post_8015216	Jun 03, 2012	2203105	2168261	SJeanette72	Hey Jeanette,I read your posting and felt compelled to speak not only as a mom but also as a obstetrical nurse. First my daughter is going to be 8 next month and she has Turner's, not mosaic but 45xo. Her symptoms are so mild that I know for a fact that most people dont know.    Yes she is on growth hormones but many kids without Turners are on them.    I have learned over many years that you truly don't know what your future is to hold regarding your daughter. I have seen many patients been counseled or chosen to terminate pregnancies with complications much less and more severe and that is a personal decision. However I thank god everyday that I wasn't given that choice as I found out when my daughter was five weeks old.    There were many tears but now the smiles and laughter and memories she bring to our lives far out weighs the possible unpleasant symptoms of Turners!    Please think long and hard before you make a de union that will impact the rest of your life!    I hope this helps!	post_4886490

These supplements could prevent deterioration of cartilage, jointsIn our country there are no genetic tests to detect gene specifically affected.Indeed, such tests can be done in European countries like France, Belgium or England.But the cost is very high (can reach 4000 euro)As a final conclusion :-    supplements listed above are effective even in time?-    what are the chances that when you get pregnant, the child to have problems?Thank you very muchIoana	post_4814612

post_5554493	Apr 09, 2010	1274651	None	None	Basically, it is 3% or 1 in 33.There are things that can increase your chances of having a multiple birth, including a mother being 30 or over when she conceives. For example, while there is a 3% chance of having a multiple birth at age 25-29, it increases to 4% at 30-34 years and almost 5% at 35-39 years.Other factors that can increase your chances of having twins include having a maternal family history of multiple births (fraternal), and of course, using fertility treatments (in vitro fertilization or fertility drugs).Your chance of having twins is also influenced by your race (multiples are more common in African Americans and least common in Hispanics and Asians), how many times you have been pregnant (the chance of having twins increases with each pregnancy), and whether or not you have had twins already.	post_4948118

However, in susceptible people, the immune system can overreact when exposed to certain chemicals (allergens) in the environment, foods, or drugs, which are harmless in most people. The result is an allergic reaction. Some people are allergic to only one substance. Others are allergic to many. About one third of the people in the United States have an allergy.	post_4826986

The only thing that was ever found genetically was that the parents genetic profiles were almost identical (like they were twins).    The parents were distant (4th) cousins and did not know that until the testing.    They did also have one "normal" child, who was the oldest.    They were told that each successive child would be lower cognitively than the one previous.    There was only one additional pregnancy which miscarried.	post_4946231

Call her doctor and tell him you want a copy of any and all records.    They may charge you a fee, then be the perverbial "squeaky wheel."    Ask how soon they will be available, and I would personally pick them up and tell them this.    Copying your daughter's reports will be at the end of their lists of things to do, BUT if it's only the labs you want, this should not be an issue, and is quickly done.    I would call them at least 2 x a day, they will get you what you need just to stop being bothered by you.    I've been on both sides, so I know how it all works.    You may not understand a lot of what is on the report, but everything is worth getting a second opinion, and I get the impression you need one.    Be aggressive on this, the law is on your side so don't allow them to ignore you, or push you around.    If I were you (and I've been thru this) I would call and explain that you had requested a copy of the reports, and you are sure they must be ready by now, and you will be stopping in at such and such time to pick them up.    Then ask them to have them available for you at the front desk.	post_5059728

post_5073675	Nov 12, 2009	872399	395787	marialou	I know exactly what you are enduring.    My oldest son inherited FAP from his father who died from it.    I thought he was getting the best care, and if his doctors didn't know the answer, they would either find it, or refer us to someone else.......WRONG!    Their egos are too big, and they cover for each other. By the time I sought a third opinion, it was too late for my son.    His doctors even admitted to one botched surgery, and weren't treating him for a serious infection, which almost took him from us.    He had to endure 6 hours of surgery at another hospital to clean up the infection, and they weren't sure he'd even survive that.    Due to the botched surgeries, withholding vital medical information from us, and their negligence, my son died a horrific, agaonizing death.    We have to be advocates for our loved ones, because they are only a number to the doctors.    It's been so painful to think that I trusted these surgeons to take care of my son, and all they did was kill him. I have worked for doctors most of my life and have seen first hand the negligence, abuse, even laughter over an elderly patient dying during a simple procedure, and this is when I washed my hands of these egotistical animals.    YOU KEEP GOING, MAKE YOUR VOICE BE HEARD, HOLD THESE PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE!!

post_5354011	Feb 08, 2010	566175	None	None	TRUE. The key word here is that being a "carrier" of CF means that you do not have CF symptoms at all.    Carriers do not show symptoms.    However for someone who has two gene mutations for CF, having a Delta F508 mutation is usually considered "classic CF" which is generally the most severe form of this disease.I am a carrier of DF508 and I had no clue.     My husband is a carrier for a "previously undiscovered mutation" and our twin daughters have CF.    So far they appear to have a severe case of CF to include severe pancreatic insufficiency and signs of airway disease as infants.	post_4861461

post_5057627	Nov 08, 2009	419309	997993	Scotland2009	I'm sorry to hear that you are having such concerns, but remember that the odds are in your favor... chances are 96% that the baby does NOT have an NTD.    I have known many people to have increased NTD risk by quadscreen during pregnancy that have absolutely healthy babies.    Quadscreen simply estimates risk, and an increased amount of AFP (alpha-feto protein) in your blood is usually what raises concern for NTDs because it is seen more frequently in pregnancies with NTDs.    However, increase NTD risk can be caused by elevations of AFP from other factors besides an actual birth defect.    Hi AFPs can be caused by placental issues, or sometimes for no known reason at all.Although some birth defects are not well diagnosed by ultrasound, the good news is    level II sonography has a good detection rate for NTDs, usually better than 95%.    Your doctor is probably sending you to specialists known as perinatologists (and perhaps genetic counselors) to have a high-resolution ultrasound with experienced eyes that are especially trained to identify NTDs.    Hopefully your 3 hour travel will be a reassurance that there is no NTD.    (And, it's not unusual for doctors to follow ladies with high AFPs a little more closely to make sure placenta isn't causing problems, so maybe that's why the repeat ultrasound in your doctor's office, so he can keep on top of any changes.)Hope that helps, and best wishes for a good outcome.~eureka	post_5055189

post_5067912	Nov 11, 2009	872399	763415	Kawtar	Yes, it does, along with other problems.    You need to meet with a geneticist to determine your chances of carrying a baby full term, and what, if any teatments are out there.    A geneticist can also discuss any health issues you may have regarding this mutation.    I do wish you luck.	post_5062632

We had a similar situation the pathology also showed it was a fused placenta. though originally they thought they were identical because they were both born with a rate genetic abnormality.    Anyway the only way to know for sure is to do DNA fingerprinting. But a quick "test" is to check the hair swirls on the back of their heads.    If the hair swirls go the same direction then typically they are identical.Congratulation on your beautiful girls.	post_4850308

post_5235429	Jan 05, 2010	533472	535822	margypops	Hi Margypops,Axona is a brand-new prescription therapy launched in March 2009 for the treatment of mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease. As Alzheimer's is marked by a decrease in glucose in the brain (the primary source of food for the brain), Axona acts by providing/metabolizing glucose in the body to act as an alternate source of food for the brain. It is an FDA-regulated therapy and is the only Alzheimer's treatment which can be used in conjunction with a patient's current medication (e.g., Aricept, Namenda, etc.). For more information I'd advise you to visit www.about-axona.com. Hope this information was useful. Anything that will delay the progress of this terrible disease is a step in the right direction.-Bigboi223	post_5200223

I have found that when i made a search on OCW Alzheimer, so I think itmust be what you are referring to.I would not jump on this anti-inflammtory bandwaggon immediately, eventhough the movies there look very much scientific and are convincing.I also made a seach on "anti-inflammatory theorie Pat McGeer" and there is lots of information coming up with tons ofscientific reports and testing. Also Wikipedia has Pat McGeer listed as the father of anti-inflammatory alzheimer scientist - so I guessthese things about the product OCW are true.But still I am hesitating to purchase this product for my mom since it is quite expensive to take on a monthly basis and as far as I read about ityou must take it regularly in order to succeed.Maybe if money is not your concern then I would give it a try.WarmestRichard	post_5183502

I have been up against the "negativity" that surrounds CNA's that they do the "grunt" work...but you know....I don't mind.    I believe in what I do.    I actually wanted to be a    nurse, many, many years ago before I had my daughter, who later we found out was on the autism spectrum.I started the biology classes, chemistry, etc. and ended up with a pituitary tumor during that time...lol!    That changed my path.    However, all these years later, I still had the interest in caring for people, so I started with caregiving after my oldest was nearly finished with high school.Like garbage collectors, etc...society would come to a halt if no one did the work.    CNA's are on the front line whether in a facility or nursing home, CBRF, RCAC, or in home care.    You are a gem :-))))	post_5338056

post_5397313	Feb 21, 2010	547368	704281	Dazon50	Dazon,CNA's are the heartbeat of patient care. They notice if someone has a skin problem, they never scold when a a patient has an "accident," they help with meals and nourishment's, make beds and assist with general hygiene and more more things that are too numerous to mention. How would a facility every operate successfully without you? And more importantly how would patients? Your intervention spots issues before they become a problem.In a long term facility you often become many a patent's family. You provide hugs, love and laughter that their families often can't or won't.I'll never forget a very sad Christmas Day for me. I was a CNA, a single Mom. I had 2 very little boys that had to spend X-mas Eve and Christmas Day with my mom because I had to work. I went to work that Christmas Morning with tears in my eyes.    A grumpy elderly male patient that liked no one and was almost impossible to please, saw my tears. Mr X was often mean-mouthed and demanding. He never had visitors and no one could reach him. He asked why I was crying. I reluctantly told him, "Because I spent Christmas Eve alone and with out my sons and I'll spend Christmas Day without them too."    To my surprise he hugged me and with tears in his eyes he said, "We'll spend Christmas together. I've been alone for twenty years. My son is dead."    We smiled and cried together, holding on to one another like we were long lost friends. I spent every spare moment with him that day. Sometimes just popping my head in his door to say hello. I became his friend, his only friend. That's what CNA's do.Granted, nurses make more money but their jobs are no more or less important than a CNA's. I would have remained a CNA had I not required more income to raise my sons. I received Zero dollars in child support.We need more great CNAs like you so don't ever think you are not very important and very appreciated.~Tuck~	post_5338056
post_5397345	Feb 21, 2010	547368	310108	jo929	I agree with you. Our society places great empathize of youth, wealthy and beauty. Seniors are often forgotten.....or at least it appears that way. Unless you are active and productive your opinion or needs do not seem to be very important or in some instances they just don't count.Other societies equate age with wisdom and seniors are honored. Today in the USA if you are beautiful in a swimsuit or great on the stock market you are honored.I beleive the Baby Boomer Generation is changing the picture to some degree, as they changed so many things in our country and aboard.Bless you for caring for a disabled husband for so many years. I know the challenges are many and it's never easy. I care for my elderly father and many times I don't even know the date. Day's become a blur of meeting his needs and trying to manage my chronic pain. I have no other life. I am sure you can relate.I find it helps to shat with others that know what I am experiencing. I hope you will be more active on the forum. Maybe together we can raise some support and activity.(((HUGS))) to You,Tuck	post_5338056
post_5397954	Feb 21, 2010	944619	None	None	Caregiver for my husband -- and losing my mind, if anybody is interested. One cannot keep her "mind" if she is never allowed to sleep nor ever allowed even a little bitty five minute "quiet time" during any day. Why do they become so babyish and 100 percent self-centered? I think it's the drugs. Doctors dope them up to try to make them stop complaining, and then send them home to the wife to deal with. My problem, I guess, is that I am apparently the only human left on the planet who is not taking drugs. I cannot find quiet time anywhere. For example, last week I cheated and left for my dentist appointment early just so I could sit in the waiting room and sit quietly and look at a magazine ... without anybody yelling in my ear and complaining, complaining, complaining. So what happens? Some other wife's patient high on prescription "Yakky Drugs" comes in and sits down next to me, another old Chatty Charlie high on prescription drugs, talk talk talk talk, yelling loudly in my ear, bragging and repeating himself ... just like at home! I started crying and everybody thought it was because I was afraid of the dental pain, but what I really wanted was for them to take me in for treatment and just don't talk, I can stand any pain if only the incessant loud repetitive talking will stop for five minutes    ...	post_5338056
post_5400597	Feb 22, 2010	547368	None	None	Lynne,I am so very sorry to hear that you are so alone in your caregiving. I DO understand. Although my father is not talking incessantly he often is angry and blaming me. I do not have a minutes peace.Everything that goes wrong can be my fault on any given day. Although I admit that his health has declined to the point that he is often unable to even be angry.    His mind no longer functions clearly and often he is child-like. He is still able to be angry and still able to attempt to drag me onto arguments about anything. I refuse to argue with him. It is fruitless.Dad has been with us for seven years. His health has declined with every year and I have gradually given up my life to care for him. Now he is terminal and it breaks my heart. However that doesn't deter my need for rest, privacy, time to myself, time for my friends, time for my grown children or any of those things that others so often take for granted.I do understand you need for some peace and quiet and my heart goes out to you. This non-crier is now easily driven to tears. Do you have any outside support? I am blessed to finally have the support of Hospice but even that is not enough.You do need support also and precious time for yourself. Are there any support system in your area?    Volunteers? may I ask what is your husband;s diagnosis?~Tuck~	post_5338056
post_5401618	Feb 22, 2010	944619	None	Tuck	My husband has heart problems and COPD and other ailments, all of them legitimate serious problems. I am wholly sympathetic about that, and very kind to him, and do everything I can for him. But ... he is not always in a "bad way" and he can/could still do many things. Just not as easy or as fast or as painlessly as he used to. The problem is that he is not coping with growing older, he is furious that he can't drink and smoke and eat anything he wants, etc. etc. He is furious about the aches and pains and restrictions. Worse, once a man has had a heart attack, every twinge of indigestion is indistinguishable from another heart attack, and panic sets in.All ER visits are at 2am, never when the caregiver is actually awake and dressed.We do have some "good" days, though.    I have bursts of self-pity when we have gone through extended periods of the bad days. This time, it started just before Christmas and is still going on.    Cold or wet weather brings it on with him because he can't work outside and he refuses to anticipate this and come up with alternate interesting activities. When he hangs around the house complaining and making himself sick and depressed, I go insane tripping over him, from the frustration of never being able to complete any chore, much less have any private "happy" time with any personal interests; heck not even a complete thought to myself because the noise never stops. (The compulsive talking comes from drugs that I deem inappropriate therapy.)    I call this Retired Husband Syndrome, more than any physical illness. My mother went through it with my dad -- she signed him up to volunteer at the hospital the day he started supervising her cleaning the toilet and questioning her lifelong method of loading laundry into the dryer ...I gave up working when my husband retired, because the first thing he did was have a heart attack (plus, he was wrecking the house being home alone, I would come home and burst into tears upon viewing the utter destruction). And since I am "not working," I guess he decided I am now his personal assistant 24/7. So yes, I consider myself his "caregiver."     Occasionally I read him the riot act -- like yesterday afternoon -- but that takes a lot out of me to cry and yell and slam doors, and it isn't my real personality. It works, though -- today he is acting all mature and independent and cheerful. That could just be because it is a nice spring-like day, though ...I have an objection about treating Retired Husband Syndrome with drugs, which is what doctors always want to do. Great, now he has a Xanax or Prozac addiction in addition to Retired Husband Syndrome, thanks Doc! Can he come live with YOU?    My suggestion is Mandatory Daycare upon retirement, but nobody will listen to me.My one request to family members and friends who want to be helpful to a caregiver:    Take the patient out of the house on some regular, predictable schedule.    Pick him up at the front door and don't bring him back until the promised time. The caregiver wants to vacuum in front of the patient's sofa or recliner and air the place out, and have some quiet time to herself. So do not insist that the caregiver come along on your outing -- that defeats the purpose. For goodness sake, don't bring yourself and your closest 10 friends and their children and pets along for a "visit" at the patient's house. The caregiver will shoot herself because now she has 20 additional warm bodies to wait on and hear complaints from ... how cruel can you be?Thanks for this forum, it really does help to gripe a little in a place the patient won't see, and provide empathy for others in the same situation.	post_5338056

post_5404489	Feb 23, 2010	547368	None	None	Lynne,Sorry but I couldn't help but chuckle..."Retired Husband's Syndrome" at first. But now I am really scared!!! I am my father's caretaker,,,,but my husband, eleven years my senior will retire in 12 days.He is already down to four, sometimes three days a week and I am noticing the very things you are talking about. Yes I need help with my father and heavy things around the house but when did the kitchen become my husband's domain? A galley kitchen at that!!!He is now trying "new" recipes. When I cook (90% of the time) he sets timers and questions my seasonings....not to learn mind you...to supervisor!!!    He decides what's for supper. If this gets worse I will lose it with the pressures of caring for a terminal father and a man in "Retired Husband Syndrome."And you know I never thought this would happen. I've looked forward to retirement with him. We owned our own business and worked together for ten years. We did very well together. We sold the business and continued our personal careers. We were/are both upper management (I'm recently disabled). It's like he has come home to be the VP of the house instead of VP of the company.His 148 IQ needs more than recipes but I can't get him interested in anything else. After reading your post Lynne I am more concerned what full time retirement will bring. I'll go nuts for sure. Lord help me!!!And yes Kobuk, we are all in the same boat. It's good to know there are others that understand what we are going through!! I sure appreciate all of you.~Tuck~	post_5338056
post_5404625	Feb 23, 2010	944619	None	Tuck	I am very sorry to be the one to tell you that you are in for big trouble. No matter how nice he was before he retired, and no matter how he treated you as an equal partner all these years ... he will change and become Boss of the House. And for some unfathomable reason, this big strong super-intelligent man will regress to a two-year old mentalilty and become utterly inept. It is so sad.You will not be able to ever ask for help with anything because "help" would mean that the "helper" do what the "help needer" asks, and he cannot do that -- he is The Boss. Instead of just doing what you ask, he must re-engineer the job, undo everything the Help Needer has already accomplished so far in the project, stand in the doorway blocking exit to deliver a lecture about his superiority and why the Help Needer has been doing this wrong all her life ... and meantime, the poor kitty has to pee on the floor when she simply can't hold it any longer while her dufus human parents argue all day about the best way to clean her litter box.In the above example from this morning, the only actual help I wanted was ... "Please get out of my way while I carry this very heavy foul litter box to the garage." Was that too much to ask? Yes, I guess so. I did not ask him to tug the dirty litter box out of my arms, tweak it to crack the plastic, spill foul litter all over the floor I had just washed and then track it into the carpet, then insist on "fixing" the box instead of just going away so the Help Needer could simply fetch the "emergency evacuation litter box" that she has stashed with the other emergency stuff (which must be kept a secrret from the Retired Husband, you can probably imagine why).If you really need any actual help -- such as "Please hold the door open for me while I bring in the groceries?" then you are really in big trouble and whatever you were doing that would have taken you 4-1/2 minutes by yourself without help, will end up consuming the following entire week.You must encourage a different hobby than cooking in your kitchen, trust me on this one. Does he have a workbench (preferably apart from the house)?    I had a small success by explaining that the kitchen sink is my version of his workbench. He did understand that, but he still forgets and is wont to camp out there, smack in the way of anything I need to do ...I tell you, the only answer is "Mandatory Retired Husband Daycare."    At least twice a week, and 10am through 3pm. Mandatory for all of them.	post_5338056

Thank you.Work Bench...oh goodness no. This book and business intelligent man cannot drive a nail straight. I have seen some of his "projects." He actually thought of being a carpenter upon retirement. I tried hard not to laugh but I reminded him I would like to keep my home and not be sued over his carpenter "errors."I have just suggested he get a part time job. I've also suggested he take up photography an unknown interest he expressed about two months ago. But he would have to leave the house to do photography. How many ppl would be interested in seeing a hundred    pics of this old woman in her PJ's? I have bought a very nice camera and will try to encourage that hobby.I too hesitate to ask for his help. A five minute job does becomes redesigned because after 33 years I have discovered I am not doing it correctly. How did I ever survive without his directives??I am hoping that we have enough projects in getting this home ready for sale for relocation to a warmer state that it will keep him busy.

I can't imagine how difficult it must be to take care of a parent or spouse.I get exhausted from caring for people both emotionally and physically at the hospital, along with their families, and then coming home and trying to find some compassion, to say nothing of some energy, to try and help people on the forum. Takes a lot out of you and I've been advised that I need to start stepping back and taking care of myself. Why does that make me feel selfish? Guilty?PeaceGreenlydia	post_5338056

Only someone that has been a caregiver can understand the responsibilities, challenges and rewards that come with caring for a loved one.We are here to listen if you need to vent or chat. Thank you for posting.My Best,~Tuck	post_5338056
post_5636793	May 02, 2010	547368	370181	greenlydia	Welcome. As I said earlier CNA's are the heartbeat of our health care delivery system. You are in the front-lines and are the ones that make the patients comfortable, provide love and caring, an ear when they need to talk and all of which seems to come so easily for the many good CNAs out there. Yes that certainly qualifies you as a caregiver as does your role as a CL.I think their should be a Forum for woman that are dealing with their retired husbands. :) So far my recently retired husband has made a "list" of the things he want to accomplish around the house. He was a VP of a global company where "lists" were the norm. Back back on track, he views this list every day and selects what he will do. Mind you these are all manual tasks and for someone that has used his brain his entire career manual tasks are difficult for him to say the least.On his list was the front yard's "two points of interest."    So decided to tackle the first re-do of one of the "points of interest." We have a large and long front yard. Now mind you I originally created this approximately 9 foot octagon shaped area eight years ago. Looked fine to me....and the neighbors. I didn't think it needed a thing. Well he has been working on it for a week and has declared it done twice. So yesterday I decided to inspected it. Imagine my shock and dismay when I discovered my octagon area is now 26 inches wide by 8 feet long. As he stood next to it smiling like he had just performed some kind of a miracle I said, "You've got to be kidding right!!!" The smiled vanished as he said, "You really don't like it?"As I post this he is back at the spot for the third time. Goodness knows what the final outcome will look like. I am guessing it will return to it's original state and he will proudly announce his latest accomplishment. Yep, it'll be two weeks of work and nothing will have actually changed other than a lot of dirt and rock moving.There must be a special reward in heaven for all of us woman who have tolerated the craziness of these newly retired husbands.    :)    Gotta love em.~Tuck	post_5338056

post_5680818	May 14, 2010	1300526	547368	Tuckamore	I have bin a caregiver most of my life, starting from when I was a kid and my mom asked me to go with her on Saturdays to help her at a seniors center, (back in the day when a worker could do that) My job was to vacumme the dining area, some other small stuff, and go and keep the seniors company and of course score little treats and gifts hahaha, you know how seniors just love a kid to come and visit, they would even make me little crafty things and wait for Saturdays as if it was all for them.Then my mom took in some dissabled guys in our house when I was young also and I got a taste of how people need help.Done care off and on as an adult some for dissabled and some for seniors who wanted to die at home and not in hospital, those were hard to do.Now I am partly dissabled myself and while hubby and I could feel my work place was trying to fire me or make my life so misserable so I would leave, he said, we should be caregiving together because he felt if I was gonna need care he would already be home to help me and because I had experience we could do it together. He had no experience so my doubts were there even tho he pushed it many times and here we are. He is one of the most perfect caregivers I have ever known, he learns from me and just the hugs and return responces he gets from our guys tells me this was the best thing we could have ever done.We have two guys, one in wheelchair and one who can walk but is partly in a chair for long disdtance walks and both are mentally dissabled. We love them both cos we were lucky enough to get two with a great sence of humor and as time goes they are learning to be a bit better on the outside. Right now we dont have any respite available cos they are not so stable out there and while we save up our holiday pay we are training them to be easier to manage in little bits with friend caregivers    on little day visits and short respite stints.Soon we should be able to send them out on an overnight but we have to find people with equipment for the one guy too so is gonna be hard.Best part is we dont travel anyway so havent really needed to go anywhere and since they are so good here it isnt so bad but we will need a break soon.I love what we do now even tho before my job realized I was sick and started giving me a hard time I did love it there. Hubby and I were both machine cleaners at the same place, I guess that is why we knew we could do this after many years of working together.Anyway I feel for you all since I have also done the senior thing, is hard to watch aging and illness setting in and I can imagine even harder when it is a family member.Even tho this is a job we chose there can be hard days here too, most of them when we are trying to imagine what these guys lose in life because of their limits they were born with.Anyway take care all and hope things can get better for many of you even if it is extra help being found somehow. Keep your hearts full of all the good memories, that helps.	post_5338056
post_5687448	May 16, 2010	612876	None	None	Hm, I'm a care receiver posting on behalf of my poor caregiver who is at work.    He cares for me, his significant other.    I have two rare diseases:    dysautonomia and narcolepsy w/cataplexy.    Dysautonomia is dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system; the autonomic nervous system is what controls blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiration, digestion, fluid and electrolyte balance/urine output, pupillary reflex, fight/flight response ... basically lots of "automatic" stuff your body does that is supposed to stay carefully balanced.Before I got sick, I used to be a caregiver myself.    I was a home health care provider (ABA lead therapist) for autistic children and did home, community, and school-based services.    I LOVE my career and I miss "my" kids terribly.    I'd trade being a care-receiver back for being a caregiver back in a nanosecond.BTW, there is something wonky going on with the survey above I think.    You can only see the results, but can't actually respond to it.    Is it closed after a certain length of time?	post_5338056
post_5700172	May 19, 2010	1252364	547368	Tuckamore	Hi Tuck, I too, tried to take the poll but couldn't figure out how it worked either. Anyway, I don't ever remember NOT being a caretaker. My Mom and Dad were the type of person that ALWAYS helped those in need or the underdogs, etc. so I always felt that is what I should do.When my 2nd husband I married (in 1981), I began my longest caretaking experience and one of the most rewarding of my life. My husband died in 1997 from complications from diabetes. In 1981 he was already impotent, didn't matter to me because I loved the man that he was. We had a wonderful life but I always managed all of his meds, meals, insulin etc. He had an amputation (leg with NO anesthetic because he    had less than 30% of his heart that functioned and ANY amount of anesthesia would have killed him and he had 0% of feeling in his leg and foot which made this possible or he would have died 2 years earlier from infection , had a penal prothesis, had more hospital stays than I can even begin to count.In 1989, I began the additional caretaking of my Mom and my Dad, they were in there early 80's and there health was beginning to go down hill. My Mom suffered from alzheimers and breast cancer and my Dad wasn't in good health, but didn't find out exactly what was going on until 4 days after my Mom's funeral when he came to dinner and couldn't get his breath. We went immediately to the hospital and he was there for 2 weeks, discovered that he had been having heartattacks for years adn had been self medicating with Tums by the case load. He died 6 weeks after my Mom. My husband, in the mean time, ALSO almost lost his life that same summer. He died in 1997. So I was juggling the caretaking for 3 people that I love more than life itself 5 years and then of course continued with my husband for another 3 years.So I lost my beloved Mom on June 4, 1994, my beloved Dad on July 22, 1994, my beloved husband on June 25, 1997, and the hardest of all (because I had NO time to prepare at all) my sweet, precious baby boy (32 years old) on July 25, 2000 from a ruptured colon out of the blue.In 1998, I moved to Tennessee from    Tulsa, Oklahoma (where I had lived my entire life, with my daughter and son-in-law to Spring Hill, TN to be with them and my first grandbaby that was 3 weeks old at the time and started caring for her full time and then my 2 nd granddaughter came along in October, 2000 (after my sons premature death) and have been a 24 hr a day caretaker of her AND she is Autistic. So all of this as you all know puts much stress on your body and adds to ANY pain that you may have.I TREASURE EVERY MOMENT, NO MATTER IF IT WAS JOYOUS OR HEARTBREAKING AND WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT ANY OF IT!!!I feel very fortunate that God gave me the opportunity to love and take care of these wonderful people and would NEVER trade anything good or bad about it.I hope I didn't make this too long, I just wanted you all to know about my wonderful family. I'm so fortunate to be with my Daughter and son-in-law (who is like a son to me) and my BEAUTIFUL granddaughters.Thanks for listening....Sherry	post_5338056
post_5758316	Jun 05, 2010	518117	None	all	I am currently I guess the caregiver of my 30 yr. old son. He is bipolar and had a serious breakdown in December. Was hospitalized 3 times during that time. He is presently living at home with me and my husband. He is in treatment with counseling, group sessions and meds. I am the one that takes him to these appointments. Plus, much of the time, I am having to be home with him almost 24/7. He is very paranoid to be alone and plus I have to worry about suicide attempts, which he has done in the past. It gets very hard at times I will admit. I am also bipolar as is my son. My mental issues though are under control. But, this with my son does cause me some depression and anxiety. Plus, I have COPD myself. I have 2 other grown children. They do not help me in the least with all this. I love and will stand by my son regardless though. But, it has me about exhausted along with my health issues. This son also had Tourettes Syndrome and ADHD as a child. It has lessened some, but I have pretty much on and off had to take care of this 30 yr. old. I wonder though in time when my health declines further, who will be the one to take care of me? I can only pray that I never get to that point. But, that is something we have no control over. My husband is not good medically whatsoever I might add. And this 30 yr. old is just his step-son. My husband tries to understand, but does not really. I will always have to watch out for this child of mine. At times, he can function on his own. But, at other times such as now, he cannot whatsoever. Just my little input on caregiving. From what I have read in these posts, others have it far worse than me.I did take care of my mother few years ago though. She had idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. She passed away in Aug. 07 at age 69. Complications 4 months later from a lung transplant that rejected. I helpled her bathe, wash her hair, helped her to the bathroom, gave her her meds etc. She was terminally ill, but was such a sweet patient. So strong in her beliefs in God and had faith that he would determine what happened to her. It was a joy taking care of her. As I got to spend special time with my momma during last part of her life. We shared many laughs, talks and tears. Precious times.God Bless all during your hard work as caregivers and to all those that are ill and need the caregiving.    Thank you	post_5338056
post_5759028	Jun 05, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Lynnkay,Welcome and thank you for sharing with us.My heart goes out to you. Caring for anyone is challenging but caring for a mentally ill son must come with it's own unique set of challenges. And there is always the concern and fear of who will care for him when you are no longer able to do so! When we care for an elderly loved one, it is our hope that we will be there till the end.Certainly it is difficult for your husband to completely comprehend your care, love and concern for your 30 year old child. I think that would be true even if he were his biological child, most men are just made differently from women. I am guessing that your husband would prefer more of your time and attention.When I cared for my father (he lived with us for almost 8 years and was a lot of care the last 2 years of his life) I neglected my husband to some degree. I suffer with chronic pain and disabilities and caring for my dad spread my energy and time very thin. Fortunately I am blessed with a very understanding and loving husband that also loved my father. But we knew my time caring for dad would be limited by his illness and age, unlike caring for your son.You have my admiration. You are a courageous and a wonderful mother and woman. Not everyone would do what you are doing. Caregiving takes a lot of hard work, time and dedication. It often tears at your heart.Regarding caring for my father I once said, I think this is the hardest thing I ever did, but now I know it was the hardest thing I ever did. I think that may be true for all caregivers. But please know that you are appreciated and that your efforts and love are not without rewards. I cherish every moment I cared for my dad, until his passing three weeks ago. I am not sorry for one minute that I gave of my time and self. I am confident that you feel the same.How lovely that you were privileged to care for your mom during her final months. Those are special times, precious moments that can only be shared between a mother and child who is caregiving.You sound like a terrific person and I welcome you to our community. I hope you will drop in frequently. Please feel free to begin a new post if you so like with any concerns or questions or just to chat. We all need the help or support of others in these situations. My best to you!Peace,~Tuck	post_5338056
post_5793592	Jun 14, 2010	1346966	547368	Tuckamore	The New York Times recently had a blog about "Who cares for the Caregiver?". The response posts were quite scary. Apparently there are a lot of lonely caregivers.I've written two stroke and brain injury caregiver books. It's very hard to get any publicity because--I guess--the media doesn't find the topic very interesting. Especially for long-term caregiving situations. (They like survivor stories much better.)I've been a 24/7 caregiver for many years for a brain hemorrhage survivor. Truthfully I gave up on getting any caregiving help from the internet. In the end, I had to figure it out for myself. I did it my way--and thankfully it worked. But its been nigh impossible for me to share the news.I don't know if anything will change it. Caregiving is not anything anybody wants to talk about---unless, of course, they are in it.MM Siles	post_5338056
post_5824237	Jun 22, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello mmm12,I apologize for my tardy response. My father recently passed and than I had a major medical problem creep back into my life so I have been absent from the Forum. Again I am sorry. I see that Cheryl has offered some assistance. She is great and I am sure has some additional great ideas for you.I am sorry it has not been possible for you to find a caregiver. It is a very difficult task for one person to take upon themselves without a back up caregiver and support. Indeed I was not physically well myself and the ramifications of caregiving may have left me in the same position my father was, requiring a caregiver or worse. The next several weeks will tell how severely the caregiving injured my already injured body.Many well ppl are just not up to the tasks, as you discovered by the New York Times Blog. It is a sad fact that often an assisted living situation or even a nursing home is the only alternative for persons in need of a caregiver.My Best to you,~Tuck.I have said it many times. It is the toughest thing I have ever done. My caregiving lasted seven years. Initially it was not so tough as my father was pretty independant for several years but I certainly gave up my own life to care for him.	post_5338056
post_5829713	Jun 23, 2010	1346966	547368	Tuckamore	Hello TuckI am sorry you lost your father. And I also hope the medical ramifications of caregiving are not totally debilitating for you.After nine years of it, I've come to the conclusion that Caregiving carries a lot of "life" lessons--and very few have anything to do with the patient.Handling stress, having no expectations for others, accepting life on life's terms, stopping the bad habits I use to relieve my frustrations, working my way out of depression, trying to take care of my health when all I really want is for the other person to get well--these are all things I'm not very good at. But I keep trying.I'm back to practicing relaxation on a daily basis. It not only makes me feel better physically, it helps me deal with all the aforementioned occupational hazards of being a long term caregiver. I started out with deep breathing and a teenie tiny bit of exercise. Already I'm sleeping better. It works.Madonna	post_5338056
post_5839172	Jun 25, 2010	1359927	None	all	I am the caregiver for my 66-yr old obese and disabled mother, who just recently came back from the brink of CHF and cor pulmonale. She's adjusting to her "new" body, having had 75 lbs of fluid stripped off in 4 weeks' time -- and I am her target.I do have a sister who lives in another state and she made it clear during Mom's last hospital stay that she could not and WOULD NOT help me or my mother in any way, anymore.    Not that she ever did before.    My sister used to come visit once every 6-9 months -- whether she needed to or not -- leave her verbal bomb and then leave after 2 hour's time.I recently resigned from a job that demanded 50-60 hours a week and took another job with less hours and stress.    And that seemed like my mom's opportunity to make even more demands on me.So I am here, dealing with and attempting to care for a verbally and mentally abusive parent - basically all alone.    She is also probably a Borderline and nothing I do is quick enough, good enough -- or just enough.    It's always more more more.Social life? Forget about it.    Read a book?    Nope.    I have given up my life for her and I am just about done.    I was looking back at the last 10+ years.    No wonder I have had such a "drought".    And no wonder I have all this stress-related weight on me.I wish I could relax.    I wish I wasn't so tired all the time.Right now, I am hanging out at the office way beyond office hours -- avoiding going home.    And then I came across this page.Anyone else out there feel stuck?    I love my mom, but I didn't sign up for this.	post_5338056
post_5843346	Jun 27, 2010	1361292	None	all	I am a caregiver for my 60 year old husband and have been for some time. My question is on how to deal with some, not all, doctors, doctor offices, home health care nurrses, etc. Sometimes I need to be his advocate and it works. Other times, it does not. How can I get answers and quality service without sounding _________?	post_5338056
post_5846577	Jun 28, 2010	547368	None	None	To Heysooz,Let me tell you that my heart goes out to you. I do apologize for my tardy response. I've been dealing with my grief and some serious medical issues.I beleive that there are caregivers that feel just as you do but don't have the courage to express their "trapped" and "abused" feelings. I have been a caregiver in some form my entire life. My father who recently passed was a gracious man that by most standards was easy to care for...because he was so such a good, kind, loving and giving man at heart. I gave seven years of my life to care for him and eight years before that helping him. I am not sorry for a moment.However not all parents or the ppl we care for are as loving and thoughtful as my father was. Many times we feel as you, "I didn't sign up for this."    Then we have to make the determination when we are lovingly giving of ourselves and being a willing caregiver and when we are simply being taken for granted and abused. If you are not able to give gladly from your heart, are you really helping that person that you love? Do you not both deserve better?Caregiving is a very complex issue. I certainly don't have all the answers. I wish I did. But from years of being in the caregiving role both professionally and personally I have learned a lot about myself, caregivers and care receivers.There are what I term willing and gracious receivers. Those are the ppl that are basically happy with themselves and life and through no fault of their own find themselves requiring care and assistance. The take graciously and give back in return even if all they can give is a smile, a heartfelt thank you and a hug now and again. There were the happy waitresses, the friendly truck drivers, the helpful, caring neighbor and the humble and kind CEOs. They make caregiving rewarding and pull at your heart strings.Than, unfortunately there are angry takers. They require care and assistance but can even try to deny the fact. These ppl have not been very happy with themselves or life. They can only squeak out a thank you if other ppl are looking and they feel obligated to do so. They lash out at angrily at others, especially those they profess to love and only seem to feel better by making others feel guilty and beholding. They find no joy in life. They were the angry customers on the phone, the gossipy friend or neighbor that could never keep a secret and the tyrant bosses. They can make caregiving a nightmare.Sometimes the ppl we love and care for are a little bit of both but in general terms I find they are one or the other. Of course their are all kinds of personalities.Through out life you meet happy, optimistic and giving ppl. Ppl that make you glad to be part of the human race like Snow White's "Happy."You also meet the pessimists, like Winnie the Pooh's "Eeyore" that never appear to be happy or satisfied with life no matter how much they have or what you do for them.Think I've strayed from Caregiving? Not really. All types of ppl end up requiring care, including those that are like "Happy" or "Eeyore."    Personally I find the Eeyore's to be extremely challenging. I know my limitations and I am not an effective caregiver for the Eeyore's on a 24/7 basis. I graciously back away from these personalities. They drain too much of my energy. There are caregivers that can handle Eeyore's effectively 24/7. I am not one of those ppl. It doesn't make me a lesser person or a failure. If you find yourself caring for an Eeyore and cannot handle it that does not make you a failure either.This lengthy explanation of some of my thoughts about caregiving has brought me to this suggestion, please seek some support with a caregivers support group. No one should feel as you do about your role in your mother's life. Frankly I could not be a 24/7 caregiver for my mother either. In my humble opinion you need to decide if you can continue to be a caregiver in this situation. I know you love you mom. But it may be time to seek alternative living arrangements for her. You deserve a life too.Please heysooz let us know how you are doing. It sounds like at the very least you need a respite. Is your mom eligible for any outside assistance, such as home health care? They offer respite and other avenues for caregivers. Does you mom have a terminal diagnosis. If so she is eligible for Hospice. No Hospice is not a dirty word, look into what they have available. Ppl can be on Hospice for many years. It is not just a three or nine months program. Truly some ppl are on it for years. They were my rock and my spport through the last year of my father's life.The Caregiver needs to take care of themselves before they can effectively care for others. It's not a sign of weakness of selfishness. It's a fact.Even as kind and loving as my father was I had moments that I felt trapped. I needed a Respite. It's all part of long term caregiving. We are here for you. You are not alone. Please post again. I will look forward to your updates.My Best to You and Please Take Care,~Tuck	post_5338056
post_5846778	Jun 28, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Baffled,You have asked a very good question. During my years of caregiving it was a frequent question I asked myself. Because I have worked in the medical field for so many years in my area I know many of the medical staff. However I admit that has it advantages and disadvantages.I found the best approach to open the lines of communication was to befriend the nurse and the gatekeeper, better know as the receptionist. I tried to send a thank you note now and again or bring in a batch of baked cookies or something similar. When I went to Fl I brought back cases of fresh mixed citrus. I know that may sounds silly but it seems to work. It sets you apart from the many, many other patients and family members that the office sees weekly. They remember you so when you call they are frantically searching their brain to remember you or your loved one.When Dad had Home Health Care (HHC) and than Hospice I got to know what each one of the liked to drink. I had coffee with half and half for one, Coke for another and Dr Pepper for another and so forth. I remembered their birthdays with cards and sometimes a little gift certificate to the coffee shop or a fast food restaurant, what ever I thought they would like. I didn't look at is a bribery because it wasn't. It was a lot of work but it paid off. They all became my friends and advocates.So as I built that I also open the door to communication. I made a list of questions and/or concerns and I presented it to them. I had the worst time with one nurse in my dad's primary care physician's office. So when I knew it was her I had to deal with I enlisted the help of the HHC or Hospice Staff or I requested another staff member. There are ways around every situation.I found that asking for their help often worked, asking for their suggestions even if I knew what I wanted or thought I knew the best way, I let them suggest it. Often I would "lead" them to the answer, if you know what I am trying to say. I let them call the shots, even though it was often my thoughts or my "shot." I let them be in charge and expressed my gratitude for their wisdom.Sometimes you just have to be the witch. At those times be assertive and not aggressive or accusatory. The two times dad went for Respite I had made two pages of notes. One contained all his meds included    when and how he took them at home. The other was a step by step outline by the hour of his daily routine. One copy went in an envelop with the transporter (ambulance) to be given to the nursing staff, one went in his suitcase and the other was given to a close relative who visited him opposite hours of my visits. She was my back-up, my voice when I wasn't there.Document, document. When you have a question or concern on Monday (that can wait) and his appt isn't till Thursday write it down. And please don't do I like have done and leave it at home. I found that if I placed it in my purse right away I had it when I needed it. If you have to add to it on Tuesday you'll know where it is and won't forget it.Kindness, please, thank you and praise will get you much further than that hiney chewing you so want to do and they often deserve. You'll catch more flies with honey than you will with vinegar. And remember your goal and the fact that you need to obtain the best care possible for you husband. You'll only get that with pounds of honey.If you have any specific incident questions please feel free to post. Our caregivers may have additional thoughts. Just because this has been my approach does not mean it is the right one or that it works in all situations.Bless you for being the caregiver for your husband. I know the challenges that come with that word and he is very blessed and fortunate to have your love and concern. Please visit us often.Peace,~Tuck	post_5338056
post_5919547	Jul 16, 2010	1359927	547368	Tuckamore	Hello Tuck,You're tardy with a response?    How about me?!?    ;-)Thank you for your thoughtful response.    You probably know how much it meant to me to be acknowledged.And the saga continues.....    How do I make suggestions to Mom's PCP that he ask her about her re-started again smoking habits and refusal to eat responsibly?The office has signs posted everywhere in the waiting area that no family members are allowed in the exam rooms -- and I have been told it is so there is no "group therapy" going on -- like family members telling the Dr what to do.    So, in that type environment, how is the Dr to know about her behavior - because I can guarantee SHE isn't telling him!My mother has started smoking again after that near-death experience in April and eats junk food like a 5-year old.    Then she has the nerve to say I made her do it -- that she's so stressed out that this is her only release.    Maybe I need to be posting this on the Borderline forum.My apologies for the mini-rant.Thank you!	post_5338056
post_7091856	Jul 23, 2011	1746163	None	Board	Hi all,I am the only caregiver of my husband of 15 years. He suffered a stroke and it has affected his left side. He can walk with the aid or either a hemi walker or the use of the wheelchair.     He has gotten to the point where all he does is eat, sleep and watches TV. I can't get him to go outside, go over to friends, nothing. The only time he leaves the house is when he has doctor's appointments and theraphy. IHis family lives two hours from us and they do not visit. My family is several states away but the do call and check up on me and to make sure that I am taking care of myself. My husband is only 60 and I will be 55 in a couple of months.    He is much to young to not be active. I truly think that he is ashamed, and depressed. I've tried to encourage him to go on walks, be he refuses. I can't help someone who is not willing to help themself. I am going crazy because I don't know what else to do.Thanks for letting me vent!	post_5338056
post_7287914	Oct 02, 2011	1825190	None	None	Hi, I take care of my Mother..Better put--I try to take care of my Mother. She has always been a very independent & such a strong woman. I try to think about how she feels now that she can't do all the things she has always done..I know that just seems to make her so angry, most times that's directed to me in some way even though I am all she has..It's hard to realize that my Mother has seemed to change is a short period of time. I look at her sleeping sometimes and it's like she aged 20 yrs in 2 yrs time..Most day's are pretty difficult in some form or fashion but I love her & I'm coming to realize it's getting even harder but I will continue to TRY to care for her as long as we can at home..I am glad to have found this site for it is hard in many way's--emotional, physical sometimes in tears..We have a homecare nurse that comes by once a week, she's only here for maybe 15 minutes {bloodwork health check}..I have a great 22 yr old son that devotes part of his time to us..If it wasn't for them I do not think I could do this completely on my own BUT I would try to because I owe her everything..I do need all the support I can find and all the courage I can muster!!	post_5338056
post_7311111	Oct 10, 2011	547368	None	None	Hi Lissa,Yes, caring for those we love can be very challenging. Bless your heart for taking on the tasks of a Caregiver. It speaks highly of your character. I know the demands and rewards that come with that title.Imagine, if we even can how difficult it would be to lose your independence? Our children were once in our care and followed our guidance. When the roles reverse it is difficult for both the caregiver as well as the receiver.In the final months of caring for my father I had Hospice to assist with a few tasks .... but the overall care falls to the actual Caregiver. The mental or emotional care I think is even more challenging then the physical care.It's been over a year since my father left this earth and I miss him more today then the day he left. The grieving eases a bit but the empty spot, that pit is always there. So as I have said so many times... cherish every moment. Hug them at every chance and never miss an opportunity to say, "I love you." You won't be sorry for the time you spent caring for your loved one.Never forget to take care of you. The healthier you are physically and emotionally, the better Caregiver you will be. We are here for you, even if you just need to vent. Feel free to send me a PM.Blessings,~Tuck	post_5338056

She calls for help constantly and does not know what kind of help she wants.    She has bed sores and says that no one put meds on them, they did, she does not remember.    Take care!	post_5476480
post_5477579	Mar 17, 2010	82861	None	None	Oooh boy.        My mom does the same - constantly calls for help if she's left alone.    As long as someone is right there with her, she's basically OK.    It's really exhausting for the visitor or caregiver to try to keep up with the sudden shifts in topic and mood.I need to find out of this nursing home has WiFi.    Mom is very computer savvy and loves to check her emails and Facebook account.    Even if I have to resort to dial-up internet access, I think she'll do a lot better with some kind of communication at her fingertips.I am soooo tired....	post_5476480
post_5485705	Mar 19, 2010	547368	None	None	Unfortunately your Mom's dementia will probably get worse. As you have noted, sun down is the worse time. There is actually a name for it, it's called Sun-downers Syndrome. Undifferentiated Dementia and Alzheimer's are cruel disease conditions.My father does not have true dementia. However the change to Daylights Saving Time set my father into a tail spin! He was disorientated, mixed up his meds and was confused with the time change. It really surprised me.Simple things throws my father off. He has trouble comprehending and does not adjust well to change, if at all. I often must repeat myself three and four times and    explain something in a different manner. If he stays in his tiny little regimented world he can mentally function. It breaks my heart.I think you are right Jaybay. Allowing your mother her usual access to the Internet for    communication and such should help her. It may even increase her mental status...or help retain more of it. Any change is very difficult for our elderly.My father crochets. It is what keeps him going. He's always working on a blanket for this person or that. I think it helps with his cognitive retention.I hear you...so tired.....and some days I am just plain exhausted!!	post_5476480
post_5503358	Mar 24, 2010	82861	None	None	You were right Tuck.    It's worse.    It's a whole lot worse - particularly since Mom arrived at the nursing home.    It's not going well at all and every day she loses more mental ground.    Mom knows it too.    The past couple of days she's told me and my sister in separate conversations that she's having terrible "dreams" that she thinks are true, and then she'll think again and realize they aren't.    She is terrified.    Mom said she's been talking to God about it saying, "Please don't take my brain, but if you have to, take it all so I don't know."I don't think the computer will make a difference now.    Mom can't concentrate long enough to read or even watch TV.My sister has to go to the hospital with POA in hand and demand the written reports of the MRI and CT scans done while she was in the ER.    We were "told" they were normal, but the psychiatrist isn't buying it, and he wants to see the reports - as do we.The on-call internist for the nursing home has never spoken to the family once.    He finally paid a personal visit to Mom this morning (after two weeks of residency) and that was only because I asked Mom's personal doctor to make it happen.    The psychiatrist is wonderful.    As soon as he received our request for a consult, he visited Mom.    Right after his visit, he called me, told me his thoughts about her mental status and suggested a treatment plan.    Now how difficult is it for the stupid internist to do that?!Tuck, I love it that your father crochets!    How lucky he at least can see well enough to do it.    I know you're facing his passing soon, but he's leaving you with something tangible to remember him by.    Not that you needed anything else for remembrance, but his blanket - finished or not - will be very precious to you I think.Sorry - looks like I wandered off my own topic a bit so I'll stop.    Guess I need to vent in another journal entry - that is, next time I can keep my eyeballs open long enough. :-)	post_5476480
post_5505373	Mar 25, 2010	547368	None	None	Jaybay,My heart goes out to you. You can vent here any time...and I hope you and everyone out there knows that. This is the forum for caregivers and the many challenges we face. No one knows until they have been in our shoes. Just like chronic pain. One cannot truly understand that unless they have or are there.May I suggest that you have your Mom evaluated by a gerontologist? I hope I've spelled that correctly. Our elderly systems can become like small children, the least change or medication combination can make huge differences in them. Both good and bad.I have seen it more than several times when medications interact badly in an elderly person causing minor confusion, illness and even major dementia. Her medications should be seriously looked at and assessed.I have observed major recoveries when the right medications are given or medication changes implemented. I am not saying that this is at the root of your mom's mental status but it sure bears consideration.Illness and changes of environments are difficult for many of our elderly. Hang in their Jaybay. I know how difficult it is. We are here for you and I am sending you cyber (((HUGS))).~Tuck	post_5476480

I'm sorry you have to go through this.My daughter once said to me (about my mother's dementia) that on the bright side, my Mom doesn't remember that she has a great-granddaughter,(9 months) so,every time my daughter reminds her of this my Mom gets as happy as she did when she first found out.Dementia is really rough.	post_5476480
post_5124728	Nov 28, 2009	547368	None	None	Hello Tlc,Welcome to the Caregivers Community.Colostomy bags are generally changed about twice a day or when they are about 1/2 to 3/4 full. Don't let them get too full or it will be difficult to change. The exact time will vary from person to person. It depends on their bowel schedule, how much they consume and the like.Precisely how to change the bag will    depend on the type of bag. It's important to make sure that they are securely attached. If in doubt you can either call the colostomy bag manufactures or if the person has just been discharged from the hospital you can call them.    If you live in a small town even the staff at Urgent Care or the ER will often at least they will in my area. We use to receive a lot of "how to" as well as "what to do" calls when in ER/Urgent Care.You may also find it on line. Let me know if I can help. Send me a PM with the manufactures name and I will look on line to see if I can locate the instructions if you cannot locate them.Good Luck to You,Tuck	post_5124663

post_5252570	Jan 10, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Ennaye,My heart goes out to you. I am so sorry that you have lost your mother. Your grief and pain must be over-whelming and you are trying to make some sense out of it. Some times there are no good answers.What I can tell you is that I have seen this is the past, an intestinal obstruction in the elderly, even in those with no history of surgery. I can share with you what I learned and saw about obstructions. Understand that I am not a physician or an expert.As we age the peristalsis (a series of organized muscle contractions that occur throughout the digestive tract) of our bowel slows and becomes weaker. That is the one of the reason we often see constipation issues in the elderly. A bowel can become impacted with feces without us being aware of it early on and than obstruct. Often our elderly are not as active as they once were, their fluid intake decreases and as the peristalsis slows it makes the the bowel more prone to disease and issues such as constipation and obstruction.A lesion can be responsible for an obstruction or diverticular disease such as diverticulitis. There are a number of reasons why this happens but it is not a rare occurrence. In fact I had to check your profile page (looking for your location) as my close friend just lost her mother in this exact same manner in the USA a few weeks ago. Her Mom was 86. There was no exact reason found for her bowel obstruction. The surgeon thought her bowel just "twisted" with age. She too was not a good candidate for surgery and passed several days following the diagnosis.There is nothing you could have done to stop this from occurring. There were no early signs or symptoms that you missed that would have changed the outcome. Our bodies get old and wear out.We all deal with loss and grief differently. If you need to know more to help you through this process, goggle bowel obstructions in the elderly. Please daughter know that this was not your fault. You opened your heart and home to her, more than many would have done. What wonderful memories you must have.Death leaves a heartacheNo one can heal;Love leaves a memoryNo one can stealWe are here for you. I am sorry that you have lost your Mom.Tuck	post_5252235
post_5449515	Mar 08, 2010	82861	None	None	Please try not to guilt-trip yourself.    I completely agree with Tuck's assessment and can add one more possibility to the list.In 1993, my 63-year-old father obstructed so badly that he vomited everything including water for nearly a week and got badly dehydrated.    Then he began to vomit feces.    My mother kept denying that he had anything worse than "a bug" and refused to take him to a doctor.    So I did.    Straight to the ER.    They did emergency surgery on him and stapled him right back up.    He had gallbladder cancer that had completely taken over his abdomen and obstructed his bowels.    He died 4 months later in a rehab hospital.    Four months of horrific, undertreated pain because he wouldn't tell the doctors what he was enduring.    This was before Pain Medicine was a speciality in many of our hospitals.My mother is the best at denying medical problems, but dad was a pretty close second.    Lord only knows what painful symptoms he endured before the cancer was discovered.    He drank Maalox by the bottle for 30 years, and had classic gallbladder symptoms but wouldn't tell his doctor because he was NOT going to have a lower GI.    No way.    Both of my parents stood by their own medical ideas: treat with over-the-counter meds; if it doesn't help, take more of the same over-the-counter meds; then ignore and deny.    Repeat.    That applied to us kids as well.    The only time we ever saw a doctor was for state-mandated vaccinations.    It didn't matter how sick we were or how much blood flowed: no doctor.    Period.If there IS any good in your situation, it is this:    your mother didn't have to suffer month after month of pain, surgery and intrusive testing.    You are not guilty of anything.    Not one thing.    I know plenty of people my age who won't lift a finger for their parents.    Your mother was so very lucky to have you by her side all these years.    God bless you for taking such good care of her.	post_5252235
post_5465207	Mar 13, 2010	1166907	82861	Jaybay	Thank you very much for your kind and sympathetic words. They mean a lot to me and are so very comforting too.I am sorry about the pain your father had to go through and that reminds me that my mother too was forever taking antacids because she felt her digestion was not good.It was her will power that kept her on her feet for a good 88years. And you are right, I am thankful to God for not letting her suffer much at the end.Thank you dear, and may God bless you.	post_5252235
post_5485737	Mar 19, 2010	547368	None	None	Thank you for posting again Ennaye.Jaybay is correct. Please do not feel guilty. Most would not have done all you did for your mother. I am sure she was very grateful and loved you very much. You sound like a wonderful daughter.As I said earlier, you missed nothing, there was nothing you could have done to prevent this obstruction. It happened to my best friend's mother and she too feels as if she missed something. But she didn't and you didn't.I believe your mom and Jaybay's father are in a much better place, though that does not ease your grief. I know when my father's time on earth is short and will soon be over.    I will feel the same. He will go on to a better place than this earth...but I will grieve him none the less.Bless you both.~Tuck	post_5252235
post_5448153	Mar 08, 2010	547368	None	None	Just a suggestion but I would make sure that your mom will use the motorized chair before you purchase it. You would not want your good intentions to sit unused in a corner. My mother will not even use the motorized chairs at the department or food stores.I don't know a lot about them My friend purchased one for her mother. I do think it was a hoveround. She obtained a physicians RX and between Medicare and her mother's supplemental insurance it was covered and it only took several weeks before she had it. It did get around well in small areas however her mother was not the best at operating it and there were a few "run ins." It did not go into the bathroom but it took her to the doorway.There is also a device, (you've probably seen a similar one on TV) that can go around their neck or be placed in several locations to summon help. I obtained information on several such devices through our local Commission on Ageing(aging). Your state should have a similar agency.As always I wish you and your mom the best...I do know how frustrating it can be. My heart goes out to you.	post_5445318

She still uses the computer with no trouble.    I figured it would be several weeks to get one delivered too.    Guess it doesn't matter now.    Mom was agreeable to it yesterday, but by this morning - forget it.    "Oh, but I need you to come over and help me with XYZ because I can't walk today....    "	post_5445318
post_5464457	Mar 12, 2010	389974	None	None	Swampy's mom has a hoveround. A few notes about motorized chairs...first, they are very strong. Swampy's mom ripped the front off her dishwasher when it accidentally got caught in her chair. Be careful if there are animals and toddlers around, its very easy to have an accident. Finally, spend a lot of time talking to your relative about how they need to be positioned in the chair and make certain there are adequate pillows etc if they don't have adequate movement.All these chair manufacturers have salesdroids that will love to show you their product. Good luck.	post_5445318

post_5442833	Mar 06, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Jaybay,I had to check your profile page to make sure that you are the Jaybay that I know. I am so sorry to hear about your mom and the situation you are in...yes I can relate.As you know I too am disabled due to chronic pain and the care giving often falls to me because I cannot work. My terminally ill father resides with us. I am his caregiver and it take all I have to meet his daily needs.I am blessed to have a brother that does help a lot with our elderly mother. She is 77. I have many years of experience in nursing and long term care but nothing prepared me for caring for my aging parents. I don't have all the answers.My mother is not quite as ill as yours, though she sounds very much like your mother in other aspects. She has numerous medical problems including COPD, Heart Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension, an abdominal Aneurysm, stenotic Carotid Arteries...and more. You are correct, as is APS: as long as you mother does not have severe dementia she may do what ever she wants to do. As my mother will tell you, she has "rights."My mother's house is also in disarray. We can spend days cleaning it and in one day it looks like it has not been touched. My sister-in-law and mother's closest neighbor has cleaned it more times than not. Mother takes her prescribed medications and inhalers on a hit and miss bases. When she is told to take them she can go into a shrieking rage. She often says she has taken them when indeed you know she has not. One of her favorite lines, "I am not senile."Mom's memory is horrible and she will argue based on her recent memory, which is sometimes non-existent. She causes strife between us siblings. We all love her and want only what's best for her but she will play one against the other. It's a bad situation.My dear brother tries his best to get her to conform to her physicians orders. Now she is angry at his "help" and has avoided him. Finally I had to give it to God. I do what I can and leave the rest to Him.    Jaybay I think that is the only option you have at this point. I know how heartbreaking it is but you have little other recourse.As long as your mother is deemed competent she can be non-compliant even if that means it will hasten her life on this earth.For what it's worth here is my suggestion. Try having a heart to heart with your Mom when she is having a better day. Tell her how you feel, how much you love her and how her actions are hurting her and those that she loves. Explain that is she continues on this course it will end her life, probably in a more painful way than necessary. I would suggest that you also set rules for you. Meaning you will do this for her if she does that...but if she refuses to follow the advice of her physician you will not support the consequences. If she has one try getting her pastor involved. It's called tough love. It was a difficult choice when we had children and it's a difficult choice when we have elderly parents.By the time your mom is deemed incompetent it may be far too late in her medical status to reverse the damages that she has done to herself through non-compliance. Pray helps me get through those thoughts and the knowledge that I am powerless to do any more than I have done or am doing. With my limitations and disabling chronic pain I have to except that I have done the best I can....as you have with your Mom.Another thought is if she is diagnosed with end stage disease she in all likelihood meets the eligibility for Hospice Care. IF she will agree to it they can take a lot of pressure off the family. Their insights and input will have greater weight with the PCP and the APS.We are here to listen. I know it's not much but it does help me to vent my frustrations here. God helps with the rest.My heart goes out to you. If you are able to come up with better solutions please let us know. We are all looking for some guidance and support. And don't forget to take care of you. Caregivers have to take care of themselves first in order to effectively care for anyone else.Peace,~Tuck~	post_5442472
post_5443558	Mar 06, 2010	82861	None	None	Thanks Tuck.    Yes, all I CAN do is vent now.    I've tried having the reasonable end of life discussions with Mom and pointed out that she is harming herself as well as my own health.    She'll sit there and agree with me and In the next breath, she's raving and raging at me that she CAN do X and she CAN do Y and she CAN do Z and by God will NOT go to a nursing home or allow an aide in her home.    A couple weeks ago she told everyone she was ready to go to a nursing home.    I didn't buy it for a second, but my brother and sister did to their great disappointment.    The next day she screeched that she never said any such thing.    You know the drill.I wish I COULD take care of myself.    After our home flooded with a foot and a half of sewage-filled, flash-flood water last April, I figured I could survive anything.    Guess not, huh?    I try to get this mess off my mind with meditation and relaxation techniques, but this time they're failing me.    I can deal better with my pain these days than with Mom.    I toss and turn all night with the sound of blood rushing through my ears and startle awake with a pounding heart. I get out of bed and shake in terror all day.    For whatever reason, I can't get myself out of this cycle.One weird thing about Mom is that she does have a clean house.    She hired maids a long time ago who come every couple of weeks, so it's relatively clean most times.    She would never allow them to come in if it weren't her own idea.    We don't dare sit on any furniture at Mom's house these days.    Like the APS shrink didn't notice the smell of urine and feces on the couch?    And this is just fine?!I could better deal with mom if she would move in with us, but she refuses - and not nicely.    I could deal with keeping her clean and fed and comfortable without losing my mind.    I could even deal with her dying in our house knowing I kept her comfortable until the end.    But this?    She's made herself a hermit since we moved here in 1980.    No friends.    No church.    And now she's pushing away family at the same time she shrieks for help.    It's just impossible and intolerable in so many ways.I'll be seeing my pain shrink Monday and let you know if she has any better coping skill suggestions for me, but I'm not exactly hopeful.    Thanks for reading my vent. :-)	post_5442472
post_5448092	Mar 08, 2010	547368	None	None	You're welcome. We all need to vent.Believe me it is NOT easier to have them in your home, especially if they are not compliant with their physicians orders. When they are in your home you know exactly what they are not doing....and with chronic pain there is no rest. Or better put never any rest. Those of us with chronic pain have all we can do to care for ourselves let alone someone else. It's a difficult challenge.You hear their every move, just like you did when your children were small. Every time you sit down they request something or need something. You never sleep well because you always have an "ear open" for them. One of my greatest fears is that I will be sleeping when my father needs me or has a episode of not being able to catch his breath...or worse yet that he will pass and I will not be at his side to comfort him. I am at the pharmacy twice a week for refills on his meds and to the store two and three times a week to obtain the special foods he requires....or the just the few select food items that he will eat.I would not want him alone by any means or in any other living situation. However caring for a parent in your home is more challenging than you can imagine.    No one knows until they are there. I feel blessed to be sharing and helping during this, my father's last season on earth but exhaustion fills my days and nights. And I imagine that is true for most caretakers, even the ones that do not also have to deal with chronic pain.Please share with us any suggestions you obtain from your therapist.	post_5442472
post_5398224	Feb 21, 2010	944619	None	None	I am thinking    you might possibly get better service in the future from this group of clowns, following them being embarrassed and having to apologize to you.    I hope so ... that's all I can offer at the moment. I go through this sort of thing with almost every single medical establishment, so I thought it was the norm.Just last Monday, my husband went "off" after being home only a couple of days after a spell in the hospital. As instructed, I called his primary physician. Instead of simply telling me the truth, that the office was closed for Presidents Day, they put me through a 10-hour charade pretending somebody was actually in the office and actively phoning prescriptions into the pharmacy for me to pick up. Turned out I was talking to an answering service that never reached any doctor or nurse, and the prescription was a fantasy. Why do this to people, isn't it more work than just telling the truth???     I ended up taking him to the ER at 2:30am after messing around all day with the lies and waiting for the phone to ring, and driving back and forth from the pharmacy without getting any prescription. Doctors just hate caregivers, is my only explanation. Or maybe the office managers have some evil psych problem about control?    Must be some reason for this.	post_5397435
post_5400458	Feb 22, 2010	547368	None	None	Thanks for responding Lynne. I think you got it right, "evil psych control problems" with the staff. And yes I do think they sometimes hate caregivers. I don't think they know what the truth is....those answering services are a joke. I'm sorry this happened to you...and your husband.If they understood how difficult the caregivers roll is they wouldn't behave in this manner. But no one understands until they have been there. I know I didn't and I have years of medical experience...some of it in long term care.My Dad's Hospice RN just talked to his Doc's staff and insisted that the narcotic RX's be faxed and than mailed to the pharmacy from now on. For Hospice patients that is legal in our state. The idiot nurse said, "And what if the prescription gets lost in the mail?"    Hospice RN said, "You'll have to take that up with the US Post Office. After the way you treated the daughter.. she is out of this."Yeah for Hospice!!!But some how I have a feeling this in NOT the end of this story. No wonder our senior citizens can't make it alone. I can't begin to tell you the mistakes I have caught that my father would have never noticed....but would have been detrimental to his health. Granted my father is terminal but even if he were not at 81 he could never wade through this pile of dung known as the health care delivery system.I hope things are better for your husband. Are you his caregiver?~Tuck~	post_5397435
post_5401480	Feb 22, 2010	944619	None	Tuck	I am extremely glad to hear that the hospice could intercede for you. That repeated run-around they were giving you, was unacceptable. I had similar experiences with my mother during her last three months, but she was hospitalized and not in our home, so somewhat easier on me. I took family leave from work and abandoned all other responsibilities, just to stay at her bedside early morning through late night. It was necessary. Doctors would actually come in and ask me the nursing questions. One exhausted day, I went down to the hospital manager person and asked her how seriously ill patients can possibly make it without a personal caregiver camped out in the room, and the response was "They would have to hire a private nurse." I did just about everything, ask me anything about respiratory care ... anyway, this experience helped me make some decisions about what I will probably do if it starts looking as if I am going down the road to permanent helplessness ...Thankfully, my husband has only occasional medical episodes with heart trouble, mostly, but a few other things too.    When he is hospitalized, it is for extremely good reason and it's very serious.    But I must be in charge of his regimens and drugs!! The mistakes and misunderstandings and goof-ups are unbelievable. He is getting better about understanding his treatments and caring abouit it, because it really is necessary to have somebody else double-check. These medications can be fatal if overdosed, it is vital to monitor and check and double-check and you can't just pop something in your mouth that was handed out to you. I grab bottles back from him and go online -- half of his medications have serious interactions with other drugs he is already taking. We are working on weaning him off of some of this stuff, to see how many drugs are merely to treat complications of another drug that was given to treat a complication of a third drug he doesn't even take any more ... the drugs alone start consuming your whole life.We are doing much better this morning, after a very hellish weekend, thank you very much for asking!	post_5397435
post_5404257	Feb 23, 2010	547368	None	None	I am glad that you and your husband are doing better. He is blessed to have you looking over things, especially his medications. I do understand the "mistakes and misunderstandings and goof-ups."I often ask myself what seriously ill ppl do without someone else to monitor them, especially our senior citizens.About 19 months ago my mother had open heart surgery. I and my sister sat at her bedside during those long days and nights, both of us are nurses. Mom was independant, about 74 and other than high cholesterol, fairly healthy. The facility has a great new cardiac unit. But still we caught and stopped errors and saw to it she received nourishment and was kept comfortable. She would get up in the middle of the night with tubes attacked and head for the bathroom totally unaware of her condition or surroundings. If we weren't there her IV's and drains would be ripped out and once she even fell. So we camped out there at night much to the staff's distress..I brought her to my home post-op thank goodness my sister stayed for about a month. It was a nightmare for mom with drugs, pain and confusion. After a few months to the casual observer she looked "ok."    However it left her memory impaired, unrealistic and disorientated at times. She is no better today and spends about 70% of the time here also..Between my father and mother medications are a nightmare. Neither has any understanding of what they are taking, let alone what it is for, when to take it and what side effects to watch for. Obviously dad is terminal and I must dish out his meds but he still will take a PRN pain medication on his own most days. My heart knows that he would never survive for more than a few days in an alternative care setting.So what do you do? I can't walk away from them. And yes this experience has made me make decisions I thought I would never make. I have made my two son's promise that they will NOT take me into their homes should I be unable to care for myself and my husband has passed, or not able. They are instructed to visit often, monitor my care to the best of their ability, take me out if I can go and write me long (large print) letters and send me cards and chocolates.....but more importantly, live their own lives.Life is a journey, full of surprises. Many of them not too nice.It's great chatting with you.	post_5397435
post_5404952	Feb 23, 2010	944619	None	Tuck	It is great chatting with you, too. I use humor to make myself laugh when it is "safe," it helps me when I start feeling depressed --    But I have to be careful about my spontaneous comedy routines that erupt here and there, because it often gives other people the entirely wrong impression.You certainly have more than a full load. I also dealt with both parents being critically ill at the same time, but it was a brief time, three or four months. My father passed away within two weeks of my mother. They were on different floors of the same hospital. My husband and I were making plans to move them to the home next door to us when it looked like my mother was recovering ... but her condition went bad suddenly and my father simply gave up. Very shocking and surprising. It was an entirely different situation than what you have in your home, and I can't even imagine how difficult this is for you. During that time I saw what you mentioned -- the patients were not nourished, were not monitored for getting out of bed, unhooking and unplugging themselves, etc. I have to think most elderly critical patients more or less just "pass away" from reasons like this. Most adult children simply will not/cannot camp themselves in the hospital rooms. My brother's contribution during our shared sad time was to chide me for being a martyr and inviting me to barbeques ...I am thinking that most people do not provide the level of care that you do for your parents and therefore have no idea of what your life is like. Well, people who come to this forum would understand and empathize, but not people in the general population. I have friends who consider themselves caregivers because they take mom, who lives elsewhere, out shopping once a week and answer her same annoying questions more than once a day, etc.I do not think life should be like this, but I don't have any suggestions for changing things. It is your personality to care this much and feel this much responsibility. There aren't any Handy Tips Of The Day!    that will make this any easier.	post_5397435
post_5408967	Feb 24, 2010	547368	None	None	Gosh Lynne, I am so sorry that you lost both parents so quickly and so time close together. It must have been very difficult. I often wonder and have been asked which is easier on the survivor, quickly gone or the lingering. I just don't know. I think it is tough whatever the length of time but in different ways.You got the martyr statements too!! I've heard them...and mostly from my brother also. I think that is the one of the ways he can deal with the fact that he gives nothing to our father. And of course there are the excuses that Dad was all HE thought he should be......another way to avoid and justify any time or obligation. And all Dad would like is an hour visit here or there. Brother offers a "beer" as his contribution.I just saw on the news that studies now indicate or prove that it is possible to die from a "broken heart." Something I and many others suspected all along.I beleive your assumption is correct regarding non-monitoring in health care facilities. Many, "elderly critical patients more or less just "pass away" from reasons like this.You're also correct, there are no tips for the day to deal with situations like mine. No words to make this challenge easier.    What I hope is that I have made my father's last journey on this earth as comfortable as possible. That he will leave this world knowing that he is cared for and loved.I do find that laughing whenever I can helps. It may seem inappropriate to outsiders but I'd rather laugh than cry...and laughter is good for the soul and healing. I found stool on the tip of my father's nose after a hour and a half of cleaning him and the room up after he had a involuntary BM, I laughed. I was so busy cleaning everything I never looked at his nose. Dad was so embarrassed. My laughter eased his embarrassment and the tediousness and not so fun task became a funny memory. He laughed too.So if there is a tip for the day it must be the old one..... laughter is often the best medicine.~Tuck~	post_5397435

I'll post my story sometime today - IF I'm not called to take Mom to the ER yet again only to scream to be discharged less than 24 hours later because she isn't "fixed" already.This thread is the first one I opened on this forum, and while I hate that we're all in a terrible position, I'm glad to know I'm not alone by a long shot.	post_5397435

post_5416759	Feb 26, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Denicalis,Welcome to the Caregiver Forum.The suppositories should come with some directions. If they do not please consult with the pharmacist.I can tell you what I was taught but again please check with his physician or the pharmacist. When inserting a suppository (always use a lubricant such as KY jelly) the person should always be positioned in bed and laying on their left side. The suppository should be positioned against the left wall and not into fecal material. It will or should take time to dissolve to be effective, approximately 15-30 minutes. If it is being expelled within 5 minutes it has not had time to act.Again please check with a medical professional. Best of luck to you. Let us know how this is working for you.Take Care,~Tuck~	post_5416551
post_5300136	Jan 23, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Bjlangston,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am glad that you found us and thank you for taking the time to post.You are aware that there are no physicians on this forum. The suggestions and opinions you will obtain are not from experts.There are a number of reasons that you hands can have a bluish/green tint. In my opinion the most obvious would be poor circulation. The medical term for bluish hands is Cyanosis. It is described as a bluish color to the skin. When any part fails to receive adequate blood supply (oxygen) it will become discolored normally in blue hues but occasionally it could appear greenish also.    Any form of cyanosis, circulation symptom or circulatory disorder needs prompt medical investigation..Your symptoms could be something fairly simple such as Raynaud's phenomenon or Raynaud's Disease or obviously it could be more complicated. I would first consult with my PCP (primary care physician). He/she will best know which speciality will be best at diagnosing your symptoms. Rheumatologists, Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular Physicians are most likely to be among the choices. Your PCP will look at the whole picture and ask relevant question to determine which one is best.I wish you the best of luck and hope that you will keep us updated. I will look forward to hearing from you again.Take Care,Tuck	post_5299378
post_5208852	Dec 27, 2009	144586	None	None	The DEA, (on the side of "God, motherhood and apple pie) has been inappropriately cracking down and tracking opiate prescriptions.    The penalities for physicians who come under scrutiny are draconian. This policy has had an adverse effect on terminally ill patients with pain relieved by such drugs.Worse yet, they track those who "doctor shop", meaning those who obtain prescriptions for an opiate from two different physicians during a given time framework.There are good reasons to limit opiates. The primary problem is that they inhibit peristalsis. This result in constipation at a minimum, and complete bowel obstruction in a worst case. The dose also has to be periodically increased. Someone who starts off on 10 mg oxycodone or oxycontin may end up two months later requiring 80 mg to achieve the same amount pain pain reduction. There is some arguement that a periodic "holiday" from opiates is good medicine. The "clock" will reset during a holiday and less drug will be required.If one has a relative on opiates it helps to have the antagonist nalaxone hydrochloride on hand, a relatively harmless drug (it used to be very popular in the ER once the interns found it could help maintain an erection) which physicians are also reluctant to prescribe. This reverses the effects of an opiate immediately, although the drug has a short half-life.Scientific American September or October 2008 (I can't remember which) had an excellent article on new treatments in pain, and noted that certain antibiotics can be as helpful as an opiate. I suggest that article be required reading.	post_5206830
post_5219594	Dec 30, 2009	547368	None	None	I appreciate your input. This is hospice which is governed much differently that a non-hospice situations. This is not a chronic pain patient. Never took a drug in his life until he began the dying process. He is not even on large doses of narctics. This man has been given weeks to months to live. Of course no ones knows when any one will leave this earth. According to the Hospice RN's, SW and Pastor as well as my past experience this not the normal or acceptable practice.There are no good reasons to allow a dying person to suffer needlessly, including constipation. When dying patients are struggling for every breath and writhing in pain no physician that I have ever worked with denies pain medications. This is a pure laziness and lack of empathy on the part of his PCP. My father never should have been in the position that he found himself in during the holidays. Even the on-call physician wanting to admit him to keep him comfortable. Hospitalization is not the goal of hospice.Drug holidays is an old practice and I do agree that there is something good to be said for them.    They just don't have a place in the Hospice setting.There is no doctor shopping here. The man can not leave the house. It is common practice to have the on-call physician cover when the PCP is not available.I just didn't know how to deal with it. However the Hospice staff have set up a meeting with the primary physician. If he will not work with them to maintain my father's comfort there are two others physicians that have offered to be his PCP and prescribe accordingly.Thank you for responding. Have a Happy New Year.	post_5206830

post_5252587	Jan 10, 2010	547368	None	None	Thank you Jo. I have learned that it is not the physician but one of his staff nurses that it "dropping" the ball. Before me father went on Hospice she was difficult for me to work with too.I have had a meeting with the Hospice Coordinator, Pastoral Care and RN. When all is said and done it is their responsibility to see that my father gets the care and medication he requires to ease his suffering in the last season of his life. They were able to by-pass this nurse and things are now as they should be. I will not hesitate to make a trip to personally see his physician should this happen again.Your support and wisdom is so appreciated. This is a difficult time for me....and more importantly my father.Thank you Jo,Tuck	post_5206830
post_5285405	Jan 19, 2010	395214	547368	Tuckamore	Hey Tuck, It's sandragene from the pain forum!! I saw that you were busy with your dear Dad. Had to write you and tell you I went thru the same thing in the last year. We had hospice help us out until he passed on Feb 24th this past year. He had had lung cancer diagnosed 5 yrs ago, lower right lobe section removed and had COPD that he suffered minimally with really. Last year at age 78 his health started deteriorating and it seemed like he was contantly having worse bronchitis/COPD also) and then got pneumonia. He started getting very teary eyed and talked about the past quite a lot so I think he knew he was nearing the end of life, at least I got the impression he didn't think it would be much more than one yr. Then he got a huge "cyst" on his forearm....really bad melanoma. We had an oncologist do a nuclear body scan and PET scans....full of cancers, fast growing everywhere. Diagnosed on Feb 20th...my poor mom's birthday(they had been married 55 yrs on Valentine's Day the week before) and Hospice came that evening....within hours the house was turned into a hospital it seemed. That was on a Friday night....on Monday night he went into a coma, Cheyne-Stokes all night, passed away mid-morning on Tues. Was really very fast once we knew diagnosis and prognosis. Doctors all said they thought it would be 1-3 months at least.Your problem with getting refills of pain meds we didn't have as any medications or supplies were delivered to the house 24x7. The Hospice was great for the most part. Was not impressed with the nurse's aid who came for a minute once but the caseworker, nurses and chaplain fantastic. One nurse who came in middle of night when we were panicking drove for 1 1/2 hr to get here, stayed with us for 3 hrs, sang in Italian to my father who seemed to calm down his breathing quite a bit. The woman Chaplain came immediately when we called on Tues and she stayed the entire day with the entire family who came(26 of us). She came back and helped us plan the Veteran's funeral service and officiated at it along with the Italian singing nurse who also sang a tribute and spoke at the funeral.	post_5206830
post_5291280	Jan 21, 2010	547368	None	None	Your post brings tears to my eyes. I am sorry that you had to lose your father. It sounds like Hospice was wonderfully supportive. Your dads condition was similar to my dads.My father has COPD caused mainly by asbestos exposure. No I am not going into litigation. It won't bring back dad's health and would be a huge stressor on him. He would never live to see the settlement, if any.Hospice has also been great for us. They visit often and consistently and when dad flares they are right here. And since the Christmas medication incident there have been no more. Hospice jumped right in and spoke with his PCP. It was his nurse that caused all the issues. She has been given "the word."For my father it has been a long haul. He was told in December of 08 that he had end-stage lung disease. He has been ill since that time. Unlike my step-father that was diagnosed with lung cancer and passed in 38 days. This good, strong, God fearing man has suffered every day for 14 months. He has lost over 35 lbs when he didn't have one pound to lose. His second wife passed 8 years ago and I and my husband are basically all he has left.This "time" has given me the opportunity to know dads wishes to the t, to reminisce about old times, to learn even more lessons and of course to love. But it has had a cruelness to it. I am grateful that for the most part his pain is usually controlled with meds. But it is a battle some days to convince him to take the PRN medications that provide him with more comfort.I am very fatigued and stretched to my limits caring for him but I know that my father is that and more so. He waits to die. I have no understanding of these things. My faith sustains me but I stumble and fall some days. I've been through a lot and faced many challenges in my life...but this is by far the hardest thing I have ever done. I have called upon every bit of medical knowledge and experience that I have and still am at a loss many days.I appreciate your input and sharing. It helps to know that others have been there or are there. We all learn from one another and the support is so important.	post_5206830

post_5179971	Dec 16, 2009	547368	None	None	Hi Betty,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum of MedHelp. I am glad that you found us and posted.I understand what you are saying. In my opinion, it's called burn out. When you deal with meeting someone needs on a 24/7 basis it is difficult to take care of yourself. You become caught up with their problems and issues. It's tough for someone that is healthy but when the caregiver has physical or emotional problems of their own it's even more challenging.I have severe chronic pain and am disabled. I have cared for my elderly father for almost 7 years who is now terminal. There is no time to care for my needs and I am sure there is not time for you and your needs.I wish I had some great advice for you. I can tell you that becoming involved in support groups, taking time to do something just for you every day and prayer has helped me. I try to get away every few weeks even if it's only for a few hours. I don't know if that will help you as you are caring for a husband.Does he get great medical care? If not be sure he does. Medications and therapy can help with depression. And make sure that you are doing the same for yourself.Please let us know how you are doing. I will look forward to hearing from you again.Best of Luck and don't forget to take care of you.Tuck	post_5179744

Sometimes Medicade will help with this, at least in my state they do.    Hang in there.    Good wishes.	post_5179744
post_5184926	Dec 17, 2009	1140161	None	Both	Hi back and thanks for replying. Nothing more devastating than no replies!!Have already investigated the respite issue but we don't qualify. I can get time away of course but whhen I'm depressed I think "What for, where will I go, what will I do?". In other words I don't have the interest and tend to take advantage of any spare time sleeping.I still work so that's respite in itself and does relieve my mind somewhat. But I'm carryin other's loads in there and as I walk out the door I put ehirs down and pick mine up.I'd much rather help them carry theirs than carry mine as it seems there's no help for us at all. Family are terrified of depression and treat us like lepers, what's new? Family are not what the media says they are, that's for sure.My husband isn't all doom and gloom but he's he's so down and helpless so often. All he needs really is to know I'm here and available if... He is a candidate for ECT but both of us have determined that will never happen. Not a chance. Rather go the full hog than do that.What a miisery I am today. Sorry ladies, your lives are as difficult as mine and I appreciate the time you took to say hello and offer some thoughts. Talk again, if you can ebar it! I do have better days.	post_5179744
post_5189215	Dec 19, 2009	547368	None	None	We can listen if that's any help.Are you both seeing good physicians and are they addressing your depression? You are right, family can often ostracize those that are needy....in part because they are frightened and don't know what to do. So they ignore the situation.Are there any support groups in your area? Please look for one even if that means you must drive a distance. It may be worth it.My heart goes out to both of you.	post_5179744
post_5198589	Dec 22, 2009	1140161	None	Tuck	Yes, good doctors but depression isn't really curable in many cases. They all say it is but the reality is somewhat different.It's the tiredness and lack of motivation that stops us, both of us, from trying to do mcuh you know. It's just so hard getting out of bed when you know what the day's going to be like, again.It helps having a bit of a vent here so that's OK. Hope it's OK.	post_5179744
post_5201157	Dec 23, 2009	547368	None	None	It's always ok to vent. I know that is helps me.Depression should be controllable at least the majority of the time. Often it can be a life-long battle. I know that some ppl just have a heck of a time finding the right medication(s) and therapist.Again I encourage you to seek another opinion. I suffer with chronic pain and I have had bouts of situational depression.    I also have a niece that has chronic depression. They have had to "play with" her meds at numerous times to fight her depression.    I am happy to report that she has been doing fairly well the last year or so. She had to change physicians to find that right combination of medications. That is one of the reasons I suggest that you try that approach also.Come vent any time.Tuck	post_5179744

I still have the scars from when I had my teeth capped, and will probably never forget the way a spoon tasted (if you had capped teeth, you'll understand), but otherwise it's a far off memory and I grew up like everyone else.    Just take care of your teeth and visit dentists regularly, they'll help you out tons.If you know a child born without enamel, seek dental advising.    They'll know what to do and give you support on how to manage the situation.    Sometimes life throws us lemons.	post_5278967

post_8308395	Sep 07, 2012	3249813	None	None	I am 40 and have the same thing.    I have a sister and mother that have it also and my son.    I have two boys and their baby teeth were and are perfect.    They appear white but if you look they aren't glossy with that enamel look.    My oldest son's permanent teeth are now all in and he's teeth are yellowed and spotted just like mine were growing up.    Unfortunately there is not a permanent fix until you stop growing at about 18.    I was in my 30's when I had full cosmetic dentistry done on my teeth consisting of crowns and veneers.    My son and I also have extremely sensitive teeth.    From all my dental work we found that my nerves in my teeth also never receded like they typically should when you become an adult.    Eating cold foods hurts, whitening hurts, etc..    The only thing that I have found to help with trying to whiten my teeth and my son's is walnut powder.    I also have him brush with whitening toothpaste at least once daily and walnut powder as needed.    Consistent applications of fluoride can help with the sensitivity issues available at your dentist.    Walnut Powder I found at an herbal shop, but I'm sure you can find it online.    I have a small jar and it has lasted us 10 years plus.    It only takes a little.    It's a very fine powder and if your worried about it being abrasive, why? you already don't have enamel and I have yet to see any visible defects from using it.    To note that when you can get cosmetic dentistry done that you can end up with root canals due to the sensitive nerves in your teeth.    It can be very pricing, but it is all very worth it.    I love my smile now, but I do hate that my son is having to deal with this.    Like I said the walnut powder, whitening tooth pastes and fluoride helps.    I've been there and I'm there again!    I hope this helps someone! Best of luck!	post_5278967

Although you don't have a definite diagnosis of Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia, it does sound like what your son has.    Physical therapy is extremely important in keeping him mobile, and flexible.    Stress, anger, frustration seems to make it worse, so this needs to be addressed with someone knowlegable in teaching him coping skills.    There is a national foundation for this, so if you do get a definite diagnosis they can help a lot.    Also, a geneticist should be involved, they can answer every question you may have, and are up on all the latest treatments, and studies going on. Blessings to all of you.....	post_5285152
post_6544715	Jan 14, 2011	1562615	None	Doctor	My wife is 30 years old in her family there are 2 son and 1 daughter (herself) they are suffering from HSP - and one brother has died due to this condition, current situation they cannot walk leg muscles are so tight and talking problem as well. according to Neuro Physician this is Hrdtry. Spastic Paraplegia but if this is the cause then why Beclofen is not working on them it was giving them more sleep then nothing, there was no effect of this tab even we reach to dose 50mg, and according to MRI report is very normal, and EGG and EMNG report is ok, I would like to know what could be this problem, Doctors are priscribing medicines based on symptomes only there is no authentic proof that this is HSP because in her family there is no one has suffered with such problem in past 3- 4 generations.i would like to go for Genetic test which can identify what is the cause of such problem and I have two kids 1 daughet who is 11 year and Son who is 10 years, i would like to protect them with such incase of any hereditary, What test can identify this problem please advise meKaleemUganda	post_5285152
post_7371689	Nov 02, 2011	1870601	None	Kaleem	Ahhh Kaleem I understand your frustration. I too have HSP - as did and do many others in my family.    Baclofen does not work for me at all. Perhaps Zanaflex (a commonly prescribed medication for spasticity) would work better, or even a combination of low doses of both. This is what my father takes. He is wheelchair bound, and cannot walk at all. You must ask a doctor about this, though, as one medication that works for some does not work for others. I cannot take Baclofen at all - it makes my legs much too weak - but I am still walking and not in a wheelchair. I use a walker to get around.The genetic test for this disease is very expensive and isn't likely to let you know if your children will or will not have HSP later in life. I understand you want to protect them like a good father, but your best route is to make sure your children eat a good diet with lots of fruit and vegetables, enough milk for bone health (and teeth!), and that they exercise through sports or walking/running at least 3 or 4 times a week, but better if it is daily. Watch them closely for signs of walking difficulties, sudden changes, knee or hip problems, numbness in the feet and/or legs, dragging one leg or foot when walking, etc. Nearly everyone in my family did not show symptoms until after reaching at least 50 years old, but my cousin's and my own symptoms began showing at age 17. I am now 48 and even with the many afflicted in my family, I was not diagnosed properly until last year.As for the tests - all of mine are also normal. No lesions on the brain or spinal cord, no bands --- the only abnormal things are my blood tests for inflammation, which are very high, but for which no cause can be found (yet I was recently diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome), and some small neurological quirks such as a positive Babinski test and occasional balance issues when I look down. It has been awful all these years trying to get through all of the symptoms and pain and find a proper diagnosis and get some kind of treatment that will work, but so little is known about HSP. There are many forms of it - my family has the "complicated form" as opposed to the "pure form", and all of us have been given diagnoses of multiple sclerosis or arthritis or other diseases we do not have - always it ends up being HSP.Watching family members suffer is terrible. I feel your pain as well as your wife and her family's pain, Kareem. I do hope you can find the help that all of you need - loved ones of those with HSP suffer a lot of stress and often feel helpless and overwhelmed, and frightened. I will keep you and your family in my prayers.	post_5285152
post_5280716	Jan 18, 2010	1178071	1161048	Angela96	Angela,I am a little confused because you say you got the gene from both parents. In my mind that would mean you had two copies, which would make you homozygous. If you were indeed homozygous, I will hope your OB would see how much of a problem this can potentially be. The are three different levels of MTHFR. Heterozygous means you have one copy of the MTHFR gene. (This is the one that 30%-40% of the population have. Lots of woman have perfectly normal pregnancy without treatment with this mutation) Compound Heterozygous which means you have one copy of each gene. One A one and one C one. Finally there is Homozygous which means you have two copies of the same MTHFR gene mutation. This mutation usually poses the most threat.Ask your Dr. to tell you which one you are. If you are homozygous of compound hetero ask your Dr. about getting an order to check your homocysteine level. This level dictates how big of a problem MTHFR is for you. Also if indeed you are compound of homo ask for a referral to a perinatologist. They are specially trained to treat woman with MTHFR and other high risk issues.I personally have compound heterozygous MTHFR with normal homocysteine. I had my daughter 13 weeks premature due to an abruption. (A clot formed behind the placenta) I had no clue I had this mutation we I got pregnant. My daughter died eight days later in the NICU. My Dr. believes just a baby aspirin and a B vitamin complex during my next pregnany will do the trick.Best wishes.	post_5236454

post_6122205	Sep 09, 2010	1440585	None	MTHFR re	From what I understand NTD's, spina bifida, and Asperger's can come from a lack of folate during pregnancy which can definitely be caused by the MTHFR gene mutation as it hinders your body from absorbing folate properly. My family has a huge variety of issues and the only link is we all have MTHFR.http://www.pregnancy-info.net/mthfr.htmlHope that may help,Aimee	post_5370405
post_6279503	Oct 23, 2010	1227139	None	All	Absolutely correct.    While there are debates and speculation with respect to MTHFR in many areas of the medical profession, there are studies that show that MTHFR (specifically homocystenemia & deficiencies in Folic Acid) are linked to NTD's and also chromosomal abnormalities.    My first son was born with Down syndrome, my second pregnancy ended in Fetal Demise, and my third was a chemical pregnancy.    I learned after these that I had the MTHFR variant C677T.    I have since then been treated with various medications including the 200% increase in Folic Acid, the 100mg vitamin B6 & 12, LD baby aspirin and also Lovenox 40mg injections daily.    I am now currently 5 weeks pregnant and very hopeful.If anyone is interested in further information, I have since created a new Group Forum here on MedHelp called MTHFR - you can visit or join here:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/MTHFR-Methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase/show/961Good luck and hopefully you will find the right information and treatments to help.    While they say in some sites that MTHFR is a "rare" mutation, it's more common then doctors think.    It's how it affects each person that is key.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_5370405

post_5995015	Aug 05, 2010	1404270	1035252	Ashelen	I know this post is old, but my son was just diagnoes yesterday with a deletion of the short arm of his 16th chromosome as well as a large portion of his 5th chromosome. He is 13 months old and is moderately delayed developmentally, very small (though was born normal size and began to taper off in growth around 6 months), and also is very far behind in speech and communication skills.The interesting thing you mentioned that I never thought about in connection to this before is that my son, too, suffers severe allergies. Cow's milk and eggs cause terrible symptoms in him. He was only breastfed for 5 months so I don't know if he would have developed an allergy to breastmilk, but the reaction to cow's milk formula was immediate.I am wondering how it has turned out for your friend's daughter? Our geneticist says that they have never seen these deletions together before and frankly can't tell us anything to expect or do except continue with physical/occupational/speech therapy.	post_5080325
post_5312488	Jan 27, 2010	1097658	None	None	Many people wonder what it takes to have twins, triplets or more. While having multiples is a gift and a blessing, there are some common factors that increase the chances of conceiving twins. Think you want to have twins or more? Here's how.-Do twins run in your family? If you have a mother, brother, sister, uncle or long lost cousin with multiples, you may wonder if you'll have them too. Sometimes twinning is hereditary.-A recent study published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology correlates the rise in multiple birth rates with rising rates of obesity. Research found that mothers with a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 30 or higer were significantly more likely to have twins.-Older mothers are more likely to conceive twins than their younger counterparts. It's thought that the body accelerates ovulation as the biological clock starts ticking faster. Seventeen percent of mothers over age 45 have multiples.-Once you have had a multiple pregnancy, you are significantly more likely to conceive -- and deliver -- twins again! Some estimates suggest that mothers of twins are four times more likely to have twins again than a woman who has never been pregnant, or who only had a singleton.-Reproductive technology has dramatically increased the multiple birth rate. Drugs that stimualate ovulation can lead to a multiple pregnancy, but multiples can also result from invitro fertilization.-The more kids you have, the more likely you are to conceive twins in a subsequent pregnancy. No one knows the magic limit that triggers a multiple pregnancy, so you'll just have to keep trying until it happens.-Most people think that you can't get pregnant while breastfeeding, that the process of lactating keeps a woman from ovulating. However, plenty of mothers of twins can disprove that theory. Some research has supported the theory that the chance of twins or multiples is increased if a woman conceives while breastfeeding.-Birth control pills are usually thought to be 99.9 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. However, that .01 percent often results in a double whammy -- multiples. Sometimes pregnancy occurs when the pill isn't taken consistently; in other cases, the hormonal mix of a particular drug type simply doesn't provide enough coverage to completely prevent ovulation. In either case, playing around with hormones can lead to hyperovulation, increasing the chances of multiples.-Many parents of multiples don't meet any of the classic criteria, yet find themselves doubly blessed. Monozygotic twins are particularly mysterious; no one is exactly certain what causes an egg to split after conception, producing identical twins. The bottom line is that there truly isn't a whole lot an individual can do to influence their chances of having twins; sometimes you just get lucky!	post_5296045

post_5460688	Mar 11, 2010	419309	1205638	madpre	Genetic counselors and maternal-fetal-medicine specialists (called perinatologists) often deal with similar concerns, but they are different in several ways.MFM doctors are obstetricians who have experience in high-risk pregnancies.    MFMs are called on for many reasons: when women have medical conditions that put their pregnancy at high risk; when women repeatedly miscarry after they get pregnant; when premature labor occurs; when there are multiples, like twins or triplets (just a few examples). MFMs are specially trained to handle complications related to pregnancy and delivery, and often assist regular OBs when a pregnancy doesn't follow normal routine.    They handle the health of the mother to best support a full-term pregnancy.Genetic counselors are not doctors; they are usually individuals with special training in understanding birth defects and genetic conditions.    (Most genetic counselors are professional with Master's Degrees instead of Medical Degrees.)    They are usually called upon to help with problems that affect the baby during pregnancy and help interpret test results related to a baby's condition:    when baby has anatomical differences on ultrasound; when baby has a chromosomal difference; when baby may develop genetic conditions from parents; when mother takes medication that can cause birth defects.    They provide information, testing options, and support to families with genetic concerns.Perhaps your doctor referred you to an MFM because of your miscarriages; however, since your pregnancy loss was due to a chromosomal abnormality, a genetic counselor would most likely be beneficial as well.    Hope that helps. ~eureka	post_5460425
post_5441041	Mar 05, 2010	419309	1205638	madpre	My condolences to you and your husband at this difficult time.    Usually, Turner syndrome is a random occurrence, and chances are that your doctor is right: it probably has nothing to do with you or your husband and is the result of a 'fluke' of nature.    As many as 1 in 3 women will experience early loss of a first pregnancy, and many babies with Turner syndrome result in miscarriage -- it's nothing you or your husband did wrong, nor is it something you could prevent from happening.IVF/IUI is usually a strong consideration for women who have difficulty CONCEIVING a pregnancy for one reason or another; IVF and IUI procedures usually do NOT include any "washing" or "cleaning" as you mentioned.    IVF (in-vitro fertilization) is simply fertilization outside the womb that is then implanted; IUI (intra-uterine insemination) is simply introducing sperm artificially into the womb. It is unlikely that either procedure would increase your chances of having a healthy baby; in fact, IVF may actually increase the incidence of birth syndromes slightly.You might be thinking of a process known as PGD, or pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, in which fertilization (IVF) is performed in a lab, and the fertilized eggs are tested for abnormalities before implantation.    However, even PGD has a 5-10% error rate -- that is, even normal test results on PGD don't guarantee a healthy baby.I know of many women who have had losses due to unknown causes and/or Turner syndrome and go on to have healthy babies.    There are cases of babies with Turner syndrome that result from a parent's inborn genetic makeup, but those cases are VERY, VERY rare and highly unusual.    Meeting with a genetic counselor should help you and your husband understand Turner syndrome and other birth defects as well as address your concerns and help to answer your questions.    Hope that helps some.Best wishes and good luck to you and your husband. ~eureka	post_5439357
post_5444052	Mar 06, 2010	1084048	419309	eureka254	I really don't know about Turner Syndrome but wanted to let you know that you are INCORRECT in regard to IVF/IUI with washing sperm.    In both cases that I have done the sperm is washed.    With IVF it's washed prior to being placed in dish with eggs to fertalize & with IUI it's washed prior to being inseminated into womens body.    I guess you possibly are not familiar with these procedures.	post_5439357

post_5445804	Mar 07, 2010	419309	1084048	Kricket212	You are right that SPERM undergoes what people call "washing" prior to ivf/iui, but that process does not necessarily remove chromosomally abnormal sperm, which I presumed to be madpre's question.    So-called sperm "wash" is to remove chemicals, debris, and dead/immotile sperm that would most likely be unsuccessful in any fertilization, in either case of iui or ivf; to better explain SPERM "washing":http://www.ivf-infertility.com/insemination/intrauterine/insemination9.php"The aim of washing and preparation of the sperm are to separate sperm from seminal plasma, remove bacteria and other debris and chemicals that may cause infection and irritation and improve sperm capacitation."http://www.womens-health.co.uk/collecting-and-washing-sperm-for-iui.html"Sperm Washing, The Basics:The term, sperm washing, is probably a misnomer because the sperm are not actually washed or cleaned. They are separated from the semen through one of several different processes ...""Ejaculate is comprised of two parts, seminal fluid, and sperm. There are many types of hormones and chemicals present in semen that can be problematic for fertilization. Prostaglandins, which are responsible for a wide variety of bodily functions, have the potential to cause serious difficulties. If high levels of prostaglandins are injected directly into a woman's uterus, the woman can become very ill. She may experience very severe and painful cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever and diarrhea because of prostaglandin absorption during IUI. That is why it is necessary to separate the sperm from the semen prior to IUI..."The sperm preparation for IVF/IUI is related to the process of    fertilization used in both methods for women who experience infertility.    In madpre's case, she is obviously able to conceive, so it is appropriate for her to see geneticists, not endocrinologists.    Though it may have been appropriate for you to see endocrinologists/reproductive specialists, it would be irresponsible to refer a woman who had fetal diagnosis of turner syndrome to a reproductive endrocinologist.	post_5439357

I read about this when I tripped across a site about Morton's toe - this is when the second toe is longer than the big toe.    As a joke I checked my kids feet and two of my kids have it.The site said if you have this toe problem then you probably have a problem breaking down b6 in the liver into the P5P.

Check to see if you have zinc spots on your fingernails.Those are little white specky spots - usually means you are low in zinc.    If so, check out the pyroluria sites - another P5P and zinc deficiency connection.    Have fun!	post_5195337

I got the 2nd TOE bigger than the 1st BIG TOE and on each finger except for my right pinky I have 1 -2 little white spots... Funny thing is i had my ZINC checked 2 months ago and it was okay and I did do a ZINC test a few days ago( i am seeing a dietitian) and they put some drops under    my tounge and it taste like water which means i am zinc defincent....    Oh well     Yep this is all FUN FUN FUN!.. Hehe... Not really fun, but hey getting some interesting answers..    I will be doing another VITAMENBLOOD TEST in a month with a large scale of vitamen checks. I will email u the results(I LOVE WASTING GOD MONEY) :o)	post_5195337

Because you are a fragile x carrier, the likelihood of passing on the fragile x gene is 50/50.    That is, in any pregnancy, each conception has a 50% chance of inheriting the fragile x expansion.Also, although boys are significantly affected when they get mom's expanded fragile x gene, girls can have similar or less severe effects, or sometimes none at at all, and some girls simply "carry" the gene.You might benefit from seeking a consultation with prenatal/genetic specialists who can give you more information about options for women with fragile x.    Hope that helps.Best wishes.    ~eureka	post_5419423

I have been advised to monitor my full blood count - particulary my red blood cell levels to try to avoid anemia and to ensure my blood count doesnt drop too low.I have also been told hereditary spherocytosis can also lead to stones on the gallbladder (I have had stones and have had my gallbladder removed).    But you would know if this was happening, you would have alot of abdominal pain.Thats all I know, even if you dont get full testing for spherocytosis I would definately thinking about monitoring your blood count through a blood test just in case.	post_5369811
post_5391412	Feb 19, 2010	1208485	1157646	Nat_16	Thanks for the reply.    The strange thing is that both my mom and aunt were diagnosed, but neither have had any symptoms and they are both in the 70's.    My aunt had her blood tested while she was in the hospital for a minor heart attack and that's when they told her.    My mom asked her doctor to test her since it's hereditary and she too, was told she had it.    That was about 3-4 years ago, and still neither has been affected by it.    I'm in my late 40's and have never had any symptoms or anemic problems so I don't know if I should even bother asking to be tested.I do suppose, however, that my doctor be notified so that it can be put in my records, just in case something ever happens.	post_5369811

post_5378683	Feb 15, 2010	419309	499045	john911	The triple screen is a blood test that has a sensitivity of about 60-70%, and the estimation of "risk" is difficult in a twin pregnancy, because no one knows which twin is contributing what levels to the measurements in your wife's blood.Keep in mind that neither the triple screen nor the ultrasound can diagnose the presence or absence of Down Syndrome, but the statistics are in you and your wife's favor: chances are greater than 98% that your baby does NOT have Down Syndrome.    However, the only sure way to know is to have amniocentesis performed, but remember that it is a procedure that does carry a risk, so it's important to think about whether or not information about the baby's chromosomes is worth the risk.    Perhaps getting a referral to and meeting with a genetic specialist would be helpful if you and your wife haven't already done so.Some more details might also be helpful:    you mentioned that your wife's due date was changed as a result of the ultrasound -- did they move her due date up or back, and by how many days? Also, was chromosome testing done on your baby boy who had the d.hernia, and if so, was it normal?With best wishes,eureka	post_5343976
post_5379651	Feb 16, 2010	499045	None	None	Hello Eureka there is no genetic specialist where we live. I'm not sure they changed the due date, but I don't know when. When we lost our son we didn't have any testing done. He was diagnosed and a couple weeks later he died we also didn't have an autopsy, because my wife was against it. The baby appeared completely normal though when he was still born at 5 months. No history of any genetic problems on either sides of the families. I also read after we got the results like you said that the test is more unreliable with twins and some doctors discouring taking it when pregnant with multiples. Our doctor told us he didn't think we should take it, but we did anyway. We also turned down the amnio, because of the risk. Do you think when our baby boy was still born at about 5 months we could have been able to tell from facial features? What is your experience with this subject is it personal?    Thanks for your reply	post_5343976
post_5379655	Feb 16, 2010	499045	None	None	Sorry also too her age was correct. It was what her age will be when she delivers not how old she is now. Also I read somewhere that the quad screen done during the second trimester is supposed to be done in conjunction with a ultrasound. The last time we had an ultrasound before the screeing was almost a month earlier. They did a level 2 after the results the screen wasw around 17 weeks.	post_5343976
post_5394136	Feb 20, 2010	419309	499045	john911	More often than not, a diaphragmatic hernia is an isolated event; I know you and your wife must have gone through a most difficult time, and my condolences for the loss of your son.    Additional testing or autopsy may or may not have revealed more information, but it's understandable your wife made the choice she did at that time.    The unexpected and unpredictable events during pregnancy can cause such anxiety, and I wish you and your wife strength and courage through this time.Because the quadscreen and other forms of serum screening have only moderately good sensitivity, the level II ultrasound also has value:    although it is unable to definitively diagnose chromosomal abnormalities like Down Syndrome, about 50% of the time, babies with Down Syndrome will show "physical markers" on ultrasound, and these markers are best identified at between 16-20 weeks. (It is important to remember, however, that also means 50% of the time babies with Down Syndrome look normal by ultrasound, and sometimes so called Down-Syndrome 'markers' are present in normal babies.)If you and your wife are committed to the pregnancy 100%, then perhaps the decision not to have amnio is a wise one.     It might be recommended that your wife have fetal-echocardiogram performed at about 22-24 weeks by a perinatologist (maternal-fetal medicine specialist), which is an ultrasound focused on the baby's heart, as babies with Down Syndrome do have a higher incidence of heart defects.My last pregnancy was over 20 years ago, and the technology, testing, and medical knowledge back then was not quite what it is now, so I have no personal first-hand experience of you and your wife's current situation.    Also, I should stress that I am NOT a physician:    my information is gained from working closely for many years with people in medical genetics / genetic research, and I hope sharing what I've learned over the years can help you and your wife.    Wishing you and your wife the best.~eureka	post_5343976

I am a pathologist and accidentally hit this site, so i'm just giving you a quick answer.    There are plethora of images of what a normal anal sphincter should look like. If yours has excess tissue, then it could be due to haemorrhoids, which are often painful, especially when you sit down and produce nature's finest--called "brown trout" in some circles.    An alternative-and less pleasant-explanation is that you've gotten a human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is classically associated with anal intercourse; such lesions are called condylomas; they're generally painless, and look like lots of little fingers ranging from 1/8 to 3/4 of inch. Only you would know your sexual history. Many condylomas go away on their own, but some don't. I'd recommend that you book an appointment with a gynaecologist to put your mind at rest. If it's an HPV infection, tell your feller that he should stick Elvis someplace else.Hope that helpsJCS, MD	post_5319944

So, I'm not sure where this leaves me at this point.    Hopefully, my Dr. will have some advice as to where i go from here.    I had been having some problems, (uterine polyps and endometreosis) and just had a total hysterectomy (had one ovary removed years ago, along with section of the cervix and the CA 125 i just had was elevated (could have been the endo) so that was part of the reason he wanted me to have the testing done...to see if giving me estrogen was "safe"....frustrating!!	post_5263217

post_5286505	Jan 19, 2010	419309	1147680	heliox	The symptoms of fragile x syndrome are associated with learning disability.    There is no clear link of fragile x to any of the conditions you mentioned: eczema, allergies, and/or scoliosis are NOT associated with fragile x.    Furthermore, fragile x, a sex-linked trait, is generally maternal in origin:    that is, passed from mother to child.    So if the learning disability in your sister and her children are due to fragile x, it most likely is on your mother's side of the family, not your father's side.    (He could possibly be passing on eczema or allergies without being the one passing on fragile x.)Hope that helps.	post_5201219

post_5179562	Dec 16, 2009	1042487	1139973	sierra651	Hello there,There are several conditions that will lead to a genetic disorder, the most common is a mutation in your genetic code that will cause one or more genes to mutate. The mutation can lead to a missing gene or multiple genes or mutation in the mitochondria.Chromosome mutations are classed like this:X-linked dominant: X-linked dominant disorders are caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Only a few disorders have this inheritance pattern, with a prime example being X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. Males and females are both affected in these disorders, with males typically being more severely affected than females.X-linked recessive: X-linked recessive disorders are also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, and the chance of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons of a man with an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene. A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (XRXr) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers.Y-linked: Y-linked disorders are caused by mutations on the Y chromosome. Because males inherit a Y chromosome from their fathers, every son of an affected father will be affected. Because females inherit an X chromosome from their fathers, female offspring of affected fathers are never affected.There is currently no cure to genetic disorders but we are now entering into something called genetic engineering so we can apply direct modification to the organism's genes. Currently we are testing on animals and there are still ethical issues to the use of genetic engineering and research to be done until we can apply it to humans.There are more than 1000 genetic disorders. The most common multifactorial and polygenic ( effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyle and environmental factors ) disorder is asthma. Cystic Fibrosis is another example of a genetic disease.	post_5178111

As for what determines their personalities, I feel it's both. But a lot depends on the age you get them.    I have a friend who adopted a little girl, and the parents endured much therapy with her and issues. She was well into her 30's before she finally got her life somewhat straightened out.    Another friend was raising her 3 kids and her niece's mother was into drugs so badly that they adopted her little girl who was 3 at the time.    A lot of damage can be done by this age. They also endured a lot of therapy thru the years, and today this little girl is grown.    She had a baby which her half sister is raising because just like her mother, she lives in the streets of downtown strung out on drugs.    Their 3 other children went on to do very well, and are upstanding adults.    I'm sure it's not this way in every case, but it was interesting.    I can understand your concerns.    My childrens father died when they were very young, yet my oldest had so many of his actions, which surprised me because he had no way to see how he acted.    My youngest son has his temper.

My youngest was dx at age 3 with Asperger's but today he wouldn't get the dx because he is missing the core deficits that are required for the dx, he is highly gifted if not exceptionally gifted, and that muddies the dx some what.It might be interesting to note that it is the 2 with only Asperger's, are by societies standards, successful in life, independant and highly respected in their area of expertise, active in their hobbies of interest and overal content and happy.The way I look at Asperger's is simply a different mind set and not necessarily a disabling dx as most would assume it to be. With Autism in the family, any offspring would have a higher lean but not necessarily a garrentee of an Autism dx. Knowing this and being proactive and involved from birth, could and should make a difference to the out come.Food for thought!Cheers........JJ	post_5092578

post_5140610	Dec 03, 2009	872399	1121487	deepss	This is the protocol if they feel you may faint, because you will distract from the care of the patient, and just basically be in the way.    I have always been asked if I can handle what is happening, but some docs are different.    Trust me, if I felt for one second that the doctor was up to no good...I would tell you!    I'm not very trusting of them, and with good reason!	post_5122452

He or she can tell you everything on what to expect in your future.    I'm sure things have changed a lot since your mother was preganant with you.    With pregnacy there is a risk for blood clotting, causing miscarriages.    But a lot of women breeze thru their pregnancies with no problems.    Your mom probably had to give herself shots of Heparin which is a blood thinner.    You and your mom should really meet with a geneticist to learn all about this, for you and any children you may have.    I believe you are also not able to take birth control pills with this due to the clotting.    Below is a link to some information on this, and treatment.    You need to read it.problem.http://www.naturalchildbirth.org/natural/resources/prebirth/prebirth35.htm	post_5070498

post_5328849	Jan 31, 2010	351246	None	MamaEarth,	HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Memory loss can be triggered by sleep disorders. Please consult a sleep specialist to start with. Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too cause short term memory loss along with tiredness or fatigue. Chronic infections too are known to precipitate memory loss. Disorders of the hypothalamus, chronic fatigue syndrome and psychiatric disorders like depression too cause similar symptoms. The possibility of premenopause causing this too will have to be looked into. The enumerated the possibilities should be ruled out one by one. Hope this helps. Take care!	post_5328146

She developed the same symptoms you are mentioning.Definitely not age related though, if indeed it is TBI.You should have this evaluated, as there are many things that can be done to alleviate the symptoms.I wish you the best and please let me know if you need any details, as I have studied the various aspects of TBI and I also do Therapy dealing with the emotional components of other related conditions as mentioned by Dr. Mathur (depression, CFS, FMS, etc.)NikoPS.Feel free to pm me directly if you wish.Your emotional pain and now your distress may be as great or greater                than your    cognitive issues.You are NOT older at 40! You are still young and you can have many healthy and good years ahead of you. There's a lot that can be done.	post_5328146

For instance, first born, rarely/never - second/third, slight increase in risk, fourth and beyond, huge jump in probability...and if you're eighth, ninth, tenth...about 95% risk.

post_6004054	Aug 08, 2010	1236893	757137	allmymarbles	Low vitamin D linked to Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseaselike most people, you're deficient in the sunshine vitamin, you're also at risk for life-robbing diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.One new study out of England's University of Exeter found that seniors with the lowest levels of D had a dramatically higher risk of dementia warning signs.Researchers followed 858 seniors for six years, and found that those with less than 25 nanomoles of D per liter of blood were 60 percent more likely to experience general cognitive decline, and 31 percent more likely to start losing their abilities to plan, organize and prioritize.But what's truly bizarre about this new study in the Archives of Internal Medicine is the accompanying editorial, which is straight out of the Dark Ages. In it, Dr. Andrew Grey of the University of Auckland in New Zealand urges people NOT to take a D supplement. He also writes that most people shouldn't even bother to have their D levels measured.I wonder if this guy even bothers reading these journals. Let me help him out here, because a second new study finds that high levels of D can help save you from Parkinson's disease.The study in the Archives of Neurology looked at the D levels of 3,173 Finns between the ages of 50 and 79, and found that those with the most had a 65 percent lower risk of Parkinson's than those with the least.Meanwhile, a new report in Endocrine Today says it's now clear beyond all doubt that vitamin D is needed by the immune, pancreas, cardiovascular, muscle and brain systems.That's in addition to all the other well-established benefits of vitamin D, which can help everything from your bones to your longevity. Low levels of vitamin D have also been linked to diabetes, multiple sclerosis, autism and schizophrenia.Cancer organization endorses the sunAfter decades of telling people to avoid sun exposure, one of Britain's leading cancer charities is getting ready to do a major about-face.London's Independent newspaper has obtained a confidential report being drafted by Cancer Research UK along with a number of other charities, and instead of the usual    about hiding inside, wearing a hat and sleeves, and slathering on sunscreen at all times, it will instead tell people that a little exposure is necessary and healthy."Cancer Research UK's SunSmart campaign encourages people to enjoy the sun safely and avoid exposures that lead to sunburn," the draft reads, according to the newspaper. "However, for most people, sunlight is also the most important source of vitamin D, which is essential for good bone health."The draft even advises people to "get to know their own skin" and understand for themselves how much sun they can take, since it's different for everyone.. I'm sure it will still approve of sunscreen most of the time and still urge people to cover up after a brief period of exposure. A new report in Endocrine Today shows just how bad the situation has become: Half of North America and Western Europe are now deficient in D, and in some regions as many as two-thirds of all people are missing out on this critical hormone. All you need is about 15 minutes out in the sun then put on sunscreen	post_5718652
post_6008630	Aug 09, 2010	1236893	757137	allmymarbles	a new study from Sweden shows that adding just one powerful antioxidant to your regimen may cut your Alzheimer's risk by more than half.Unravelling the mystery of Alzheimer's diseaseThe overt signs of Alzheimer's disease don't usually appear until after the age of 60. But we now know that damage to the brain begins much earlier, often up to 20 years earlier.The disease begins when abnormal bits of protein called plaques and tangles begin to form in the brain. As a result, a person with Alzheimer's appears more forgetful or has trouble completing complex tasks, like handling money or paying bills.As the plaques and tangles take root, more healthy neurons in the brain begin to die. Eventually, the carnage spreads to the hippocampus, an area of the brain responsible for building and storing memories. By the final stages, damage is so widespread that even basic functions -- such as speaking or swallowing -- become impossible.Unfortunately, the top three Alzheimer's drugs on the market haven't been proven to slow the progression of this disease one iota. Not one iota!In fact, one independent study in the UK showed that patients taking the drug Aricept had virtually the same timeline for decline as patients taking a placebo (42% taking Aricept ended up in an institution after 3 years, versus 44% taking the placebo).Seniors cut Alzheimer's risk by up to 54 percentScientists from Sweden began their study with a hunch...a hunch that a powerful antioxidant could protect the brain against Alzheimer's disease.The scientists recruited 232 patients over the age of 80 with no signs of dementia or Alzheimer's disease. They took samples of the patients' blood to check for vitamin E, an antioxidant typically associated with supporting the heart and immune system.Then, the scientists checked back in with their patients six years later. During that time, 57 of them developed Alzheimer's. But the patients who had plenty of vitamin E in their blood at the outset of the study had a clear advantage. In fact, these patients had a 54 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's. That's right. One simple vitamin cut their risk by more than half!So exactly how does vitamin E protect the brain?Well, scientists have no definitive answer. But generally, they think that it simply helps to gobble up free radicals that contribute to nerve damage in the brain. It also seems to play a role in preventing oxidative stress.Oxidative stress is bad, no matter where it happens in the body. But in the brain, it can lead to the build-up of protein. And as you'll recall, protein in the hippocampus causes the early, overt signs of Alzheimer's disease. The person becomes more forgetful or has trouble handling money or paying bills.The good news, it seems that good 'ole E seems to help prevent all this.Vitamin E: More than just the sum of its partsWith all the positive effects it has on your overall health and well-being, there's never been a better time to add vitamin E to your regimen. As this study showed, even men and women in their 80s benefited from this powerful antioxidant.Just remember, there are eight different naturally occurring forms of vitamin E. They all play a different role in the body. In fact, the participants in the study who garnered the most protection against AD had all eight forms of the in their blood. So if Alzheimer's is a concern of yours, make sure to look for an all-natural gel cap that contains all eight fractions of vitamin E.By Dr. Allan Spreen	post_5718652
post_5932185	Jul 20, 2010	704281	193490	Yvette BG	Thank you for sharing your situation and the challenges you are facing.    It is hard to know what exactly to say, because people are different and what works for one may not work for another.May I ask if it is your cousin who bothers you the most with the questions?    How close are you to this person?I think being honest and admitting you are finding this a challenge and have to juggle various things as well as not having the time/patience to talk about his condition right now.    So much is changing and it is hard on everyone and you are doing your best to deal with it.Can this person be more involved in helping?Setting time limits on the listening part works for some and telling them you need to attend to business.    Doing a round robin type letter whether email or personal to let others know updates is another.It sounds like your Father is pretty independant so designating someone to do the updating role would be hard to do if things are not coordinated with his permission.    In the meantime, maintaining contacts is important, especially if things take a turn for the worse and someone needs to be power of health, etc.I am a firm believer in honesty being the best policy but in a respectful way.If you are frazzled or don't know who, what and where, you should have the freedom to say...I am in the dark, he made plans for such & such and didn't consult me.    You will need to keep trying to reach him if you want to talk with him...etc.Best wishes in handling this and you are right....it isn't easy.    It is downright awkward for some and heart-breaking for many.	post_5886066
post_5937495	Jul 21, 2010	193490	704281	Dazon50	Thank you for making the time to respond to my questions and concerns in such a helpful fashion.My father's cousin, my aunt (my Dad's sister-in-law), and one of my father's long-time friends (lives in N.C.) are the hardest ones to respond to, I find. The cousin and I are not close and only really started talking together every so often on the phone a couple of years ago; I've never met her in person and let's just say, she's odd. I'm closer to my aunt and the friend from N.C. Maybe we can tap into the friend from N.C. for help; that's a good suggestion. He has told me a couple of times that he doesn't think my father should be living down there, but come to think of it, I never asked him if he shared this sentiment with my father. And I will try talking with my aunt further; my uncle died about a year-and-a-half ago and she's been really grieving so I haven't solicited help from her.Thanks again.Take care,Yvette	post_5886066
post_5938634	Jul 21, 2010	704281	193490	Yvette BG	You are very welcome :-)    It is hard to see deterioration and not be able to do a lot until given power of attorney health, etc. to make decisions.    Big thing is being able to be there in some capacity or having someone trustworthy to check in, etc. so that your loved one isn't taken advantage of.Unfortunately there is far too much of that.    So important that family members be on the same page to figure out who does what and how to monitor the changes, etc.In home care agencies they are big on promoting setting things up before getting into the deep situations where the person can no longer make the decisions wisely and then having to go through the competency, etc. determinations.    A lot of us dont' feel ready to cope with all that because of other challenges.    Trustworthy friends can be an important asset and part of the support team.I wish you the best as you work this out and deal with your own feelings too :-)	post_5886066

post_5914041	Jul 15, 2010	193490	378028	k80sg1	I can understand your concern. A couple of questions--How long has this memory loss been going on, that she can't remember having taken a shower? And how long ago did she see a doctor, and what tests if any did they do when she saw him/her?If she hasn't seen a doctor lately, since she seems worse today than she has been in the past, I would call and see if the doctor can see her today.Many different conditions can cause memory problems (including alcohol and/or other drug problems). Even infections like urinary tract infections can cause trouble thinking and remembering, as can nutritional deficiencies. (Is she running a fever and how does she feel and seem otherwise?) Certainly neurological conditions including dementia can cause memory problems.Please keep us posted as to how she's doing.Good luck,Yvette	post_5912553
post_5917370	Jul 16, 2010	378028	None	None	Thanks for the information Yvette, she has never visit the doctor for this problem before as previously the memory loss duration only lasted for several minutes at most and I thought everyone had it once in a while. However this time, it lasted for almost half a day and eventually come back to her senses. We will be bringing her to see the doctor tommorow.	post_5912553
post_5925598	Jul 18, 2010	704281	378028	k80sg1	I just want to back up Yvette's posting as she mentioned some of the main reasons that can be tied to behavioral changes.    The UTI's is one that a lot of people don't realize...which is why when someone is having dementia type behaviors, it is recommended to get a urine specimen to have tested. An elderly person can even have hallucinations with UTI's.Symptoms of Alzheimer's can include forgetting that one has eaten a meal, where someone has been, getting lost while out in the community, putting things in strange places, not appearing to remember having met someone.    It is with increasing frequency these things happen along with mood changes.Seeing the Doctor is an excellent recommendation under the circumstances.    I agree with Yvette in asking you to keep us posted.    We care :-)))	post_5912553
post_5922540	Jul 17, 2010	193490	None	heartfluttersawayplz	My heart goes out to you. Has your mother's doctor talked with your father about her condition, and explained it to him?Do you think your Dad would be willing to read some books or articles about Alzheimer's and dementia?You might want to contact your local Alzheimer's Association. They have a lot of information including books and videos; many have support groups for family members and/or family information series. Our local one has a family support specialist you can talk with on a 1:1 over the phone for advice and support; that might be something your father would be more willing to do than go to a support group. Maybe you could do a 3-way conversation if you have an extension phone.Good luck,Yvette	post_5916477
post_5923227	Jul 17, 2010	704281	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	You have a heart-breaking situation.    Yvette BG gave you some good suggestions :-)May I ask who your Mother thinks your Father is?    How far along is she?    It is not uncommon when getting farther along in Alzheimer's to flash back to other times in one's life and some one looking like an old man doesn't fit with a younger man one fell in love with.Also, behaviors not seen before can be very puzzling. Someone who was pleasant becomes combative.    Family members have a difficult time reconciling this person to the one they knew and loved.    So a way of adapting to it is to remember that person when the difficult times come and deal with it.    This happens in my situation daily.    No two days are the same.In your case, could this be your Father's way of dealing with this situation...denial of not being able to handle it?    It must be so hard on him.Some families visit the Alzheimer's unit of facilities to get a better idea of what is down the road and ask questions of how behaviors are dealt with.    Support groups are a good resource also.    Churches sometimes have groups and facilities hold support group meetings and/or hospitals.There are good sites on the internet also.    I receive emails from one that is helpful.http://www.alzheimersweekly.comWishing you the best as you face this difficult challenge	post_5916477
post_5923795	Jul 17, 2010	212161	None	None	thank ya so much for being there for me in this time.     my mom looks likes shes in stage 6 of this bad bad thing, her mom had it as well and has now passed on. my mom is 70 and has had since she was 64 i think. they live with me in my basement so i see all that goes on and i help take care of her. never a dull moment in my house. shes coming up the stairs all day long telling me stuff that never happens.she thinks my dad her husband is her father/ or my dads father. she cries because she say her husband has not been home in days and that makes my dad mad at her. he gets mad when she puts things up he cant find or when she washes clothes with the softner instead of soap powders but she knows no better . i ask her to get me some clothes hangers today , i went into her bedroom and she was looking for them in her jewerly box so sad to see my mom go down like this its breaking my heart.my dad trys to act like its not happening but he needs to face the facts and stop being so hard on her. i know hes od to hes 76 and i know its hard on him like it is on me but hes not helping the matter and its making it really hard on me.i have told him i would go with him to class so we can see what we need to do but he will not go, i have gotton books but he says he does not want to read them, he does not want to know whats next.     he tells me hes going to run away and leave her with me that he cant take it anymore and that his life is over for him. yes i feel sorry for him but i also have my mother to look after to. if i could run away i just might but i love my mom and my dad so i do what i can. i just hope i can hold out and that my hubby sticks with me on this.	post_5916477
post_5924497	Jul 18, 2010	704281	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	That is sad.    When I worked at the facility, I had a lady who sometimes thought her dad was coming to pick her up and would get mad & become combative when anyone told her that her Dad wasn't alive.Other days, she was wandering around looking for her dead husband.    It was hard for me at first to "lie" creatively, but that is what the nurses did.    Saying, something like, your dad has an agreement with us to watch you till he comes to get you.    Why don't you go and rest and I will let you know when he arrives.    Her daughter was very saddened by her Mother's aggressiveness as she had never been like that growing up and after.I have heard that said over & over....they were not like that, they would be so embarassed if they knew they were like that.........Re-directing is something most of us do to help in these situations.    If she has a special box filled with things she likes, having her get that out.    There are many things that can be helpful.    Music if there is no hearing loss that prevents being able to hear it.Sounds like your Father is grieving & going through stages.    He has lost her in a sense in this situation.    She is somewhere that he cannot understand nor go, especially if she doesn't recognize him for who he is.    It is easier to say.."snap out of it"....but we know that is impossible.There are glimpses of the person he loves and being there at those moments to share is important.    To keep things on a realistic level, hugging him and telling him that you would be there for him in the same way if this happened to him.Also that others are watching how you treat your Mother and learning from it.    There are many silver linings but it takes some reaching to find them with God's help.Thank you for sharing.    It is ok for you to share your grief and vent here :-)	post_5916477

I would definitely be seeking it with what you have mentioned.I wish you the best in seeking better understanding.

If he doesn't think he is the one to make the determination, he will know/talk over with you who to send you to...Neurologist specialist, Gerontologist, Geriatric psychiatrists, specialists in Alzheimer's disease.Then it wouldn't be so overwhelming as to where to begin with your opening the white/yellow pages.    You can check with local hospitals who have support groups for families with Alzheimer's to find out who they are connected with, checking into local support groups with the Alzheimer's Foundation/Society can also give you more information.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/alzheimers/AZ00017http://www.alzfdn.org/I am glad you have choices in who you go see :-)    That is good news.

The older we get the more time our bodies need. Does not mean that later when we are better we cannot do the things we like.

He had open heart surgery (heart valve replacement and 1 bypass) and suffered a minor stoke during the procedure. He's now totally befuddled; has considerable memory loss; and now must adapt to the physical limitations of partial paralysis.It's difficult watching the mental and physical decline... but, the change is even tougherfor my dad as he was so independent before... and, now must depend on the kindnessof others.What I've done is that I've accepted the mental/personality change(s) as a byproduct of both the medical procedure and the aging process... and, I don't personalize it.	post_5883872

How terrible.It sounds like you have good care for your Mother and as hard as it is to wait, they want to see how things are when the infection clears up.    Keeping her safe and helping her to be as healthy as possible is very important.You can always seek other opinions if that would help give you more peace.    I know it is hard wishing that we could do so much more than wait.    With behavioral changes, one can feel more distant, especially when there are changes in the routine.I hope & pray your Mother will recover from the infection to be functioning at least as good as she was before the fall.	post_5591150
post_5611575	Apr 25, 2010	1031547	None	None	I am sorry about your mom. I hope she is able to get over this infection soon. it could be the infection that is causing her to do this, or she might have had her Alzheimer's progress. I am only hoping it is the infection,do they feel she might have had a TIA (a mini stroke) My husband's grandmother was in a community care home with the 2nd stage of Alzheimer's and one day I stopped in bringing in our new born and her favorite, a Choc. shake. I noticed she wasn't speaking and she was "pocketting" her food (putting food to the cheek and not swallowing. even showing her how to swallow it didn't help. thenI noticed her hand was tucked in a little and so was her foot.    I was told she moved to the 3rd stage of Alzheimer's . I didn't believe them as I took care of people who suffered from this disease. so I called my MIL and sure enough the doctor said she had a small stroke (TIA)I know it is hard the wait and see, but I wish you guys the best of luckMichelle	post_5591150

post_5553314	Apr 09, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Rimi,I apologize....I don't know how I missed your post. Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. Again I am so sorry that I missed responding sooner.I would be concerned about a 53 year old that is threatening suicide. Her threats should be reported to her physician and taken seriously.She may just be experiencing the 5 stages of grief as identified by Elisabeth KÃ bler-Ross in 1969. Yes ppl with a life altering illness, chronic pain or a terminal illness will often go through the stages of grief, grieving for their former lifestyle, their former self.These five stages are: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. These stages do not necessarily occur in the stated order. Some ppl skip a stage or skip back and forth between stages or never enter a stage.The medication could be adding to her mental status. Sometimes narcotics or other medications can cause or add to depression. I encourage your FIL to speak to her PCP and get her into some type of therapy. This will help her sort out her feelings and a therapist should be able to determine if her threats are real or just a normal part of the process.I don't know how much you know about CBGD. Depression is common. Dementia can be a prominent feature of advanced disease and may be the most common feature. Aphasia can be seen in over 50% of patients. Apathy, social withdrawal, bizarre behavior, hypersexuality irritability, and anarthria have been described.Your FIL should not be over looked. Care-giving is one the the hardest things you (or he) will ever have to do. No one can imagine the stress and anxiety that Caregivers experience unless you have been there. He needs some support and releif. I hope someone is giving him Respite hours. It is so important. He has to be well in order to be a good Caregiver. He may also benefit from some therapy.It's sad that your husband, their only child and so far away. I encourage him to call home as often as possible. hearing from those you love is so important. If at all possible I encourage him to return for a long visit. His parents need him. They were there for him and in my opinion he needs to be there for them to the best of his ability.Mean survival rate for persons with CBGD is about 8 years. As dementia sets in she may not recognize her son and time may be of the essence if your husband would like some quality time with is mother.My heart goes out to all involved. Cards, letter, phone calls will mean so much to your husband's parents at this time.Best of Luck,~Tuck	post_5530660

post_5599886	Apr 21, 2010	82861	None	None	Primary caregivers are often overlooked by the very people most involved in the situation.    I heard it time and again while caring for my mother.    My siblings finally saw that I was nearing a breakdown, but they didn't step up to the plate.    They really thought that I could just turn my back and do nothing.    That was their idea of me taking care of myself.    It never mattered that I begged them to do X, Y or Z and take some of the responsibility.    There was usally an excuse to remain uninvolved leaving me holding the bag.    Now that she's gone, they're left with their own guilt.    Miss no opportunity to tell your loved ones just how much you do love them, and follow that up with loving action whenever possible.    It doesn't have to be anything big - just a visit or regular phone calls.I understand that many people have zero skills when it comes to illness and end of life issues.    Many people simply can't face it head-on and hide until the ugliness is over - to much everlasting regret.    It's frightening for everyone involved, and learning those skills tends to be on-the-job training with little guidance from the medical profession.Dementia was the worst part for me.    Watching my mother slide toward death over the last year of her life was bad enough, but to watch her mind go...    she was so intelligent and logical and organized and she knew she was losing it.    I could deal with tears and depression, but Mom reacted to her body's changes with anger.    It's exhausting to try to have a conversation with a patient who has dementia.    It didn't take too long to figure out what would trigger an angry outburts and either avoid it or redirect the conversation to safer topics.    The rest of my family weren't around Mom enough to hone their own skills and instead chose avoidance as a defense.    I hope and pray that their regret taught them not to run away when they're next faced with the same situation.	post_5530660

post_5719761	May 25, 2010	82861	None	None	What a wonderful post Tuck.    In a way, I think that when we caregivers lose a loved one, we have two empty holes in our lives and hearts.    One for the person himself, and another in all the empty hours now in our everyday lives.    We get the double-whammy in the grief and recovery department.    But as you said, it's worth every moment - every minute of exhaustion and worry and despair.    God bless you my dear.    :-)	post_5694587

post_6916332	May 18, 2011	547368	None	None	Hello All,It's been a year since I wrote this post. The one year anniversary of my dad's passing came and went with extreme pain... I relived those extremely challenging, heart breaking final days of dad's time on earth and those days that followed until his burial.I miss him more today then I did a year ago. The pain has eased a bit but I still find myself sobbing or the tears just quietly roll down my face. Some days it's like it was yesterday and other days it's like it was eons ago. I am told I am going through the normal stages of grief...it can be pure hell. It comforts me to some degree to know that I am not alone.... And even more comforting is knowing that my father left this earth with the Holy Spirit and that he suffers no more.I want to share with all of you Caregivers that there is no guilt. When you do your best and give your all in Caregiving you are NOT left with so many, "What ifs." That is a true blessing and I think it helps in the healing process. Your efforts are not in vane.My father was much wiser then I. He worried how I would handle his passing and life without his unconditional love. He expressed these concerns to the Hospice Staff numerous times and more gently to me. He instructed me to go on with my life after he was gone and enjoy it and live it to the fullest. He knew me so well. It has been and continues to be the hardest thing I have ever done or experienced.I just want to encourage all of you that are caregiving to continue doing so to the best of your ability. Be sure to take care of yourself too. Find some time everyday to be good to you and find some time to get away periodically. You must care for yourself before you can effectively care for a loved one.Thank you Caregivers.. for the sacrifices you make to continue to do what you do. I am sure your loved one appreicates all you do and probably more then you'll ever know. You are all blessed!!!My Best and Love to All of You,~Tuck	post_5694587
post_7943733	May 11, 2012	1446412	547368	Tuckamore	Your post brings tears to my eyes.    My condolences to you.You made many good points in your post.Your father had a wonderful daughter.    He must have been a wonderful man.    I have recently lost a parent so I have an understanding of    how you feel.    You never really expect that moment to actually arrive.I always try to be the best caregiver that I can be every single day.    I am not always perfect.    Some days I am exhausted.    Some days I just cannot keep up with all the housework, medical appointments or medical paperwork or outside interruptions.    Those are the most difficult parts for me as a caregiver.    But I keep trying. I love just caring for my family member more than anything in the world and if the outside forces would sometimes just go away and let me do my job, there is nothing more rewarding in this lifetime than the job of a caregiver.    I know that I have been blessed to have been given such a vocation directly by God Himself.	post_5694587
post_5863289	Jul 02, 2010	193490	547368	Tuckamore	Hi, Tuckamore--Good survey, but hard for me to answer. It depends so much on the day and the way the pendulum is currently swinging. I'm a long-term care giver; have been providing help and varying degrees of care to 2 aging parents beginning in 1998. Since then, between my 2 parents, they've had 3 brain surgeries (shunts for hydrocephalus), 2 open heart surgeries, 2 cataract surgeries, gall bladder surgery, and prostate surgery. My mother also developed an infection (Clostridium Difficile) which lasted 9 months and required hospitalization and multiple trips to doctors; I developed it as well and was sick for about 3 months. Now my father has probable dementia and refuses treatment.Between Dec. 1st, 2007 and August 1st, 2008 alone, my parents each went through open heart surgery and my mother had 2 brain surgeries (within 6 months of each other.)So add to your list having to care for 2 ill people at the same time (my folks are divorced)...I guess for today, I'd answer, "Other/ Feelings of frustration," as that's what I'm feeling with regards to my father; very frustrated.Looking forward to seeing what other people vote for.Take care,Yvette	post_5847402
post_5865906	Jul 02, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Yvette,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am so very glad that you found us and took the time to share your caregiving story. You have faced a lot of caregiving challenges. I would agree that it depends on the day as to what the biggest challenge may be.Yes I have cared for both of my divorced parents in my home until May 13th when my father went to his heavenly home. My caregiving began in earnest in 1994 or 1995. Prior to those years I have been responsible for doctor's appt and caregiving for them or their second mates.I took care of my grandmother in my home for several years also. I can't remember when I wasn't a caregiver....so it sounds like we have a lot in common.Your plate is overflowing. How do you keep your sanity? When do you find time for you family outside of your parents and yourself?We are here for you and I hope that you will visit often. I look forward to getting to know you.Take Care,~Tuck	post_5847402
post_5886155	Jul 08, 2010	193490	547368	Tuckamore	Hi, Tuckamore--Thanks for your note. Wow, you've been through a lot. Sorry to hear about your losing your Dad this spring.You mentioned not remembering when you weren't a caregiver. That's how I feel sometimes. A former co-worker/friend I lost touch with when we moved away years ago recently contacted me again. It's funny; I've had a hard time responding to her note and she's a really enjoyable person. I think it's just a matter of, how do I explain what's life been like since I moved back to Wisconsin? Where do I begin? It feels easier to stick with people closest to me that have known me before as well as during my caregiving years.I've been doing an OK job of keeping my sanity. Some days are definitely better than others. I saw a therapist with a special interest in caregivers earlier this year for about 2 or 3 months, and that helped with the more acute stress at the time. I know what I need to do to take care of myself....like many other people, sometimes I just forget to do it or don't follow up on what I know in my heart I need to do, for a variety of reasons.Thankfully, I have 3 close friends that help me laugh and keep my sense of humor, and an incredibly wonderful husband that I wouldn't trade for the world.My friends have known me for 15-30 years and have truly been lifesavers during the most challenging periods. Not surprisingly, all 3 have been caregivers themselves...Thank you for sharing yourself and your perspectives as moderator for this forum.I really appreciate it, and know that others do as well.Bye for now,Yvette	post_5847402
post_5942055	Jul 22, 2010	1169894	547368	Tuckamore	I just found this forum and it's comforting to know we are not alone. I have been caring for my husband since 1995, before we married. He has had Leukemia, Hep C., 17 bulging degenerative discs, cirhosis, failing liver, and now maybe liver cancer.Somehow we had two kids in the process - and a third moved in with us from a former marriage. I lost my job end of June - just before a long hospital stay for him and the cancer testing. I think there was a plan that I am supposed to be at home right now with family. We'll find out Friday the MRI results.The result lately is he sleeps most of the time and wakes middle of night to have "breakfast" (ice cream) and meds. He wants me home but the kids want to get out of the house after days of being homebound. They don't complain too much - but they start on each other until I can't stand them being in the same room.We have all been affected and two of us are on meds to help depression. One has started getting in trouble - as he acts out without his father "present". The youngest just wants to understand and wants attention. He is my second mate caregiver - bringing some joy to his parents when they feel low.Taking care of three grief stricken children while I grieve is a worrisome prospect. I pray we have more time - more good out of bed time together.Between us we have four living aging parents who are in other states. In 70's and 80's - we'd like to be there for them too but that cannot be for now.Friday we'll know more. I pray for strength and little fairy godmothers to come for all of us. I have been asking for Mary Poppins for years. Take care!	post_5847402
post_5972614	Jul 30, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Caringforhim,My heart goes out to you. Your plate if over flowing!! How are you doing?I learned that the most important thing a caregiver can do is to take care of their self. That is NOT selfish. It does not mean that you love the person you are caring for any less...it means that you have to be well enough and strong enough to be able to be the caregiver. So take those moments for yourself when they are offered...and Be Very Good to You.What were the results of the MRI?I do not know if you are eligible for Hospice. If you are PLEASE contact them. There is much mis-information regarding that wonderful service. It is not for just for "the end." Ppl can be on Hospice for years. Indeed ppl have been discharged from the services because they were no longer deemed, end stage disease. Their knowledge, support, education and caring is indescribable. They will help your husband, you and your entire family through whatever lies ahead. They will even help fulfill your Mary Poppins wish! :)I apologize for my tardy response. I have had some urgent medical issues of my own of late which has limited my time on this Forum. I do apologize again.Our children suffer so much when they are young and facing such heartbreak. I think it hurts us just to see their pain.Your parents must certainly understand you inability to be there for them right now. Send them notes, cards and letters when you can find the time. If you can't just pick up the phone and say, "I love you.".Please let us know how you are doing. I cannot express the empathy that I feel for you and your family.God Bless,~Tuck	post_5847402
post_6341434	Nov 10, 2010	1501846	None	None	New to this community. Have been my husband's caregiver since his stroke Jan '2009. Also provided care and support for his mother and brother (mentally ill) who both lived 11/2 hr from us. She passed away in May and we then moved his brother to our town. Youngest daughter now works with watching over him.Bil and I were both self-employed, so income has changed drastically. My time is spent taking Bil to doctor and therapy sessions at a nearby university. His insurance doesn't pay for therapy so working with O.T. And speech students at the university has been a great help and relief. Currently Bil has been admitted to the hospital for tests. He has had chills, sweats, pain on his right side (stroke left him right side with right sided paralysis and expressive aphasia) NO fever, but chilled and shaking so bad. This has happened about five times in the last month. I need to stay with him at the hospital to help communicate for him -and I don't always get it right for him.Largest challenge is different from day to day - currently it's time for me. Other times it's guilt or anger. It's frustrating to see 'friends' who no longer call or visit for various 'reasons'. I won't list all their 'reasons' here.Sometimes it's the frustration of not enough time in the day to accomplish what needs or should be done.That's all for now. Need to get back to Bil.Cindy	post_5847402

That is when my world turned upside down more than once. He was my caregiver I have Fibromyalgia and MS now that the table has turned my biggest challenge I believe is "losing myself or just trying to hang on to what sanity I have left". Oliver is totally dependent on me for everything from bathing to dressing and everything in between. I have no help we cannot afford a home care agency and because of that Oliver has no Health Insurance. I made a promise to God asking him to let Oliver live I promised to take care of him and never leave him and I wont I love him so much and I wouldnt know what to do without him in my life. I just hope I dont lose myself or go crazy...All I know is that I pray every day for some kind of guidance	post_5847402

post_5893618	Jul 10, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Vicki,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am so very sorry to hear that you have so many challenges with being a caregiver for you parents. Many of us can relate.You should be very proud of yourself for even trying to care for both of them No one can imagine how difficult to job is until they have been there. Your challenges are even greater with you illnesses. I took care of my father for almost eight years in my home until his recent passing. I also care 60-70% of the time for my mother, his x-wife. I have multiple physical problems including chronic pain and disabilities. So I know the compromising position you are placing your own health in while you care for your parents.If it helps we do understand and empathize with your position. I am fortunate that my father did not have alzheimer's, however my mother is having severe memory problems.Saying that caregiving is a big job is an understatement. Do you have    the support of another sibling or a Home Health Care Agency? If not please enlist as much support as possible. Your need to care for yourself FIRST before you can be an effective caregiver.Do you have an opportunity for Respite? Again if so please take advantage of it. I am not certain of all the assistance that the state of TX offers but I know that they do offer many of the programs that my state of WI offers. If you haven't please talk to your local Human Services Office. Any help you can obtain will be beneficial.Don't feel guilty if you can no longer care for both parents, You must be well physically and mentally in order to take on and continue this huge task.Of course they are angry but understand that they are not angry with you. They are angry with their loss of independence and what is happening to them. Even though you may understand that completely it is still very difficult to deal with their anger, memory loss and the physical demands and problems that goes hand in hand with caregiving.Keeping tack of medications, running for numerous medication refills, worrying about their safety, transporting them to and from appts, handling the wash and cooking and all the other things that go along with 24/7 caregiving is over-whelming. There were days I didn't know If I could make it through one more.What I can tell you that if you are able to continue to care for your parents you will never be sorry for the sacrifices that you are making. I do not regret one moment of the time I gave caring for my father. It's the greatest gift you will ever be able to give them. But I would imagine that as the disease progresses it will become next to impossible to care for them both without a lot of outside support at the very least.Do your best, as I am sure you are but don't be afraid to say you cannot continue your role.    Your parents would not want you to put your health in jeopardy to care for them. Remember how very much they love you. They just may not be able to express that as well as they would like to express it or was once able to do.Please tell us more about how you are managing. My heart goes out to you as does my admiration and respect. There are very few children that even try to keep their parents at home. Bless you for all you do.I'll look forward to hearing from you again soon.Blessings,~Tuck	post_5890491
post_5894121	Jul 10, 2010	1344677	547368	Tuckamore	Wow, thank you so much for your encouraging words.    I really needed that.    There's a caregiver site http://www.thefamilycaregiver.org/caregiving_resources    that I have joined to get support and education.It's a great relief that I am not alone.    At first, I thought I was.    Everything happen so fast.    It's not like we watched him get t his way the accident took him and it was so quickly.    None of us knew what to expect.    One day dad was okay the next he was in the hospital not know who he was.    He had hallucinations, and actually thought I was his wife.    He didn't know who mom was and that was very upsetting to her.    He was he the hospital for a week and was delivered to the nursing home the next week.    There two days and had a stroke and went to the hospital for another week where his hallucinations were terrible.    He actually thought he was picked up by a helicopter every night to some unknown place.    Dad had a stroke and with tests found out    he had vascular dementia.    He also has a heart condition.    Through this whole ordeal I was there by his side. When went back to the nursing home he was frightened.    He would wake at night and try to leave so I decided to stay a few nights until he got use to the place. For a while I was his wife.    He did not know who mom was.    He saw his mom, sister and other siblings who are passed.    He would call in the middle of the night to come and get him.    Or, to bring his teeth glue.    Always about the teeth glue.I    had to make a decision.    He seem to depend on me so much. I was staying with mom because she couldn't drive and she has dementia/bipolar.    She needed the same support.    I found her crying in her chair rocking back and forth - " I can lose my daddy."    I finally made the decision.    I had to leave my job and move in with them.    Plus, I had to give up my apartment and the belongings in it.    I had no one to help me move.    It took me a month to get what I decided to keep and had to let the large items go.    I couldn't carry them.     Additionally, I was breaking my lease and boy did they put it to me. I didn't care I had to do it.The last part of changing my life is I had to file for bankruptcy.    I started a new segment of my life as a caregiver for my mom and dad.There is more to all of this - I have a blog where I wrote the story.    Now, it seems that I'm getting ill and eventually will need to go and take care of me.    But in the meantime, I'm their daughter and I will watch over them.    My brother doesn't seem to want to get involved unless he has to.    He just says if I moved he would try and get them to go into a home.    My dad says "Over my dead body."	post_5890491
post_5894599	Jul 10, 2010	547368	None	None	You poor dear. I can only imagine what you felt. I think I would have done the same. I can read the love and concern for your parents in you post. How very heartbreaking.    You were and are very brave.Although my dad's mind was sharp to the very end he had moments that he called me by my mother's pet name. I look so much like her when she was younger. Although they were divorced by her choice, she was his first love and he loved her till the day he died. It was heart retching.You have given up your life to care for the parents that you love so dearly. Now what? As you lose or if you lose your health this will be a huge impact on three lives. Is there short term assisted living for your parents? Would a month allow you to recover enough to return to the current living situation or is this beyond a Respite?It seems to always be that there is one sibling taking on the entire responsibility of caring for a parent(s). I think there are numerous reasons for that scenario but none of them seem to matter when you are the one that is the caregiver. My grandmother use to say, "Why is it that one parent can take care of five kids, but five kids cannot take care of one parent?" It was a great question, one I could not answer. I also took care of my grandmother in my home until I could no longer physically care for her.If their is anyway that you can get some time away to heal, please try to do that. Your "job" is huge. I don't know the specifics behind, "I'm getting ill and eventually will need to take care of me" but would a short respite help prolong the time you have with your parents? I would not have believed the differance that the two short Respite periods made in my physical and emotional health. Granted I am not bio-polar but my physical limitations and chronic pain is great.You did not say if you have consulted your local human services department. The last 14 months my father was on first Home Health Care and than Hospice. Both were great support systems. Hospice was thee best. If either if your parents have a terminal diagnosis they should be eligible for Hospice. I originally thought that Hospice was only for the last few months of ones life but that is no longer true. Many requirements have been changed. Our local Hospice has clients that have been in the program for three years. It is through them that I was able to take a short Respite several times and at no financial cost to me or my father.You are right, you are not alone although it may seem like that at times. I had an internal "clock" that seemed to be connected to my father. I always knew when he needed me in the middle of the night. He never had to call me. I would sit right up in bed at 2,3 or 4:00 AM and know that he needed me. That 24/7 caring takes a huge toll on healthy ppl, let alone those of us with physical, emotional and mental challenges. Don't run your batteries completely dead. A re-charging may be all you need. Is your brother able or willing to come and spend time with your parents, thus giving you a much needed break?I hear myself in your words. I do understand your love and dedication to your parents. I also understand the need to care for one's own health first.I pushed myself too hard, too long. During the final days of my dad's illness I tugged and lifted on him (alone) to reposition him in bed. It's a long, complicated medical story that I will not go into here but I have undone repairs that were made to my body that in all probability cannot be repaired again. My dad would be crushed if he knew this. But his final wish was honored. He never spent a day in a nursing home. I don't know if I will be able to say the same for my mother.We are here for you. Again I cannot tell you how much I admire all you have done and continue to do for your parents. If you are forced to give up your commitment due to your health status NEVER feel guilty. You have done far more than most children ever even attempt to do. You must always remember that.    And don't allow anyone to try to make you feel guilty, unfortunately you'll probably do enough of that on your own.Hug your parents whenever you can, tell them how much you love them, even though it is obvious that you do. My only regret is that I wish I would have hugged my father more. Now I would give most anything to be able to hug him again. In the end he went to quickly. I honestly thought I had at least this summer with him.Take care of you. Find time for the little things you enjoy and above all don't forget to be good to yourself.You and your parents will be in my thought and prayers. I'll look forward to hearing from you again.Peace,~Tuck	post_5890491

Plus, it seems we were both on the same parallel road.I love both of my parents and that's why the decision to move is a hard task.    My mom always says they will be okay that I need to live my own life.    But then she will turn around and tell me how much she depends on me and wouldn't know what to do without me.    Duh!For the last two days I've had a bipolar attack.    I don't know any other term. Just recently, I got home from my vacation.    I went to see my son in Wilmington, NC and rented a place on the beach it was great.    Peace and Quiet.    When I got back my mother was hugging me all over the place.    Even dad was    happy to see me.    But I just wanted to go to my room.    I just didn't feel right.The next morning I did the usual go to the den and read the paper with them.    My mom has a bad back but got a big shot in it by the doctor and she felt really good that morning.    She was talking a lot.    I mean chatter, chatter and it was getting higher and louder.    My ears and hand was feeling anxiety, my    heart was racing and my skin started crawling.    I had to leave the room.    I haven't had this kind of anxiety attack this one was different.    I had to go to my room. I took a couple of anxiety pills and stayed in my room all day.    The next day I was still having a feeling like pressure and dizziness.    I have no idea what it was.Could it of been because of the sonogram I had. I    hep C and they were checking my liver - I've had hep c for a long time.My mom had come to my room and gave me a big hug.    I haven't had one of those for a long time.     I had mentioned once to her that's it's hurt to give so much and not get anything in return.I appreciate your communication.    May I ask what your illness is.    I guess I could check your profile. But I wanted to ask you.    I want to be your friend it seems we have a lot in common.	post_5890491

post_5890032	Jul 09, 2010	1344677	1374640	moodyone	First, how old are your parents?    My parents are 83.    My dad is the same way.    He had a bad fall last year that resulted in head trauma, along with Vascular Dementia.     Your parents have been taking care of themselves for a long time and they just don't like it when someone tells them what to do. It's like giving up and admitting your getting old and there's something wrong.    My dad use to be a strong person and took care of mom, the house, very active.    Now he can't do that so he is very angry.    Dad's have a ego they're suppose to take care of you.    You not take care of them.    I'm my parents caregiver now - they both have Alzheimer's/Dementia and it's the hardest job out there.    I do not wish this on any one. You lose your own live because you are taking care of them.    They lose touch on how your feeling and only on their well being.    That's my dad.    Sorry, I didn't mean to rattle on.    I'd be glad to talk further if you wish.	post_5889887
post_5893561	Jul 10, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Moodyone,I am glad that you found the Caregivers Forum and took the time to post. I am sorry to hear that you are having some issues with your parents. I too wonder their ages?Parents often do not like taking advice from their children. Some times    they have great difficultly taking suggestions from their children because they fear role reversal. They have always been "in charge."    They do not like relinquishing that roll, even when it is appropriate.I assume you may be the youngest of the family which makes it even more difficult for parents to heed advice from their baby. No matter how old you are, you will always be a child in their eyes. That can be both a blessing and a curse.Actually you should be proud that your parents have asked you to stay behind. You will be near-by if you are needed. If it were my parents I would want to be home with them rather than leaving them alone with your dad's medical issues. You may be needed.I know that parents can be difficult but too quickly they are gone or debilitated. Please try to enjoy them while you can. And try to resolve your current dispute.Best of Luck,~Tuck	post_5889887
post_5898339	Jul 11, 2010	1377000	None	Moodyone	I'm not yet in the position of your parents but I do have grown children. I do however have three grown children and feel as though I am still parenting at least some of the time so when they try to tell me what to do I definately don't like it so I can understand how your parents feel. It's hard to relinquish your control especially when when you think your right and your child is wrong. I cared for both my parents when they were both very I'll and close to the end. It does help to have some one to talk to so don't be afraid to rant if you need to. Ii believe that's why we're all here to support one another.	post_5889887
post_5918424	Jul 16, 2010	1374433	1374640	moodyone	Probably, your parents are stresses out too. What many parents don't realize is the amount of stress that they pass to their kids when they are stressed out themselves. Perhaps, you could try doing a chore around the house and help your mom on a regular basis, be it a small one. And then slowly ask your question when she is in a peaceful mood. Even when you are right, asking others when they are in a wrong mood can blow it up.	post_5889887
post_5919261	Jul 16, 2010	144586	None	None	First of all I am very proud of you.You must recognize that your actions have been in accordance with the "doctrine of the reasonable and prudent man".You did the right things. You gave the right advice.It is difficult to be ignored in such a situation.As you go through life you will encounter many situations where you will have to decide whether to "throw yourself over the railroad tracks". Often, in doinhg so, you make everyone mad at you and get no thanks.The arbiter of your actions should be:"Is there a life-threatening situation and will my actions make a difference in preserving life"?Your dad is very fortunate to have you as one of his children.Everything you did meets that criterion.	post_5889887
post_5502963	Mar 24, 2010	82861	None	None	Oh boy, are you bringing back bad memories of what we went through with my grandfather.    He was still driving (or something like it) at 93, and very proud of it he was too.    Each state handles these things a little differently, so you'll need to check the statutes in your area.    Maybe a call to your local DMV?Here in Texas, you have to have a doctor put it in writing that a person can no longer safely drive.    There is very wide latitude in that determination.    While grandpa had had some small fender-benders, one time he decided to get on the busiest freeway in Houston using the exit ramp.    :-O    Even reporting that to his doctor did not convince him to get involved.    Then, the doctor told grandpa that his family was trying to take away his license!    You can imagine the shitestorm that ensued.        We tried to go directly to TX state offices, but to no avail.    He kept driving until the last 6 months of his life when prostate cancer invaded his brain.    We buried his drivers license with him.    :-)These situations are just awful when the senior refuses to give it up.    I can understand it.    For many, that's their last sense of real freedom.    BUT, it's also a matter of public safety.    If you think his doctor can keep his trap shut, you might try that route first to discover exactly what the requirements are to void his license.    While HIPPA rules prevent doctors from telling family anything without patient consent, the reverse is not true.    The docs are under no obligation to withhold from the patient any information that the family gives him.    It's a judgment call.If your dad has had any documented accidents, you may want to collect the official court paperwork on that to help prove your case if it gets to that point.Sometimes seniors won't listen to alarmed family members, but they will if a doctor "suggests" they shouldn't drive any longer.    Any chance of that happening in your situation?    More importantly, have you spoken to your dad about it yet?    It's also possible he's ready to stop driving, but doesn't want to ask family for rides.    If you haven't had that discussion yet, give it a try.    At least give him a chance to feel like it's HIS decision to stop driving.	post_5498696
post_5505148	Mar 25, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Pam,Thank you for posting. I am so sorry that you are faced with this concern. It's one we often have to consider as our loved ones age.Luckily my father gave up driving with some instances from me. As Jaybay said I let it be his decision. He is 81. He still retains his vehicle and his licenses which allows him to feel independent and beleive falsely that some day he may drive again. I think it is important to allow them that "hope" as long as they do not drive. However if he tried to drive I would than have to take other steps.In my state you must pass an eye test every few years. At that time you are assessed at least to some degree by "looking" to determine if you appear fit to still operate a MV.When I took my son to get his license their was an elderly gentleman that could not even understand the directions to take th eye exam. He could not hear and could not even bring the test machine to his eyes. He failed miserably. The examiner could not compensate his license as he still had a month left before the expired. However she instructed him to return with a completed form from his physician attesting to the fact that he was able to safely operate a vehicle. He also had to have the eye exam done by an opthamologist.I "turned" the guy in but there was nothing that could be done until he failed the test or his physician deemed him unsafe to drive. I watched him struggle to get behind the wheel and drive down the road at 15 miles and hour, often over the line.If it were my father I would contact his treating physician. He may be able to do something. You are correct that his physician can not discuss your father with you, based on the HIPPA laws. However nothing stops you from talking to his physician and giving him your opinion.My heart goes out to you. You are in a difficult position. But please protect us. You and your father would feel terrible if he injured someone.Please let us know how this turns out for you. Best of luck.~Tuck	post_5498696
post_5538217	Apr 05, 2010	549511	None	None	We have a road traffic authority you can report to,and your name isnt told to the person that you are concerned about.Can you speak to your local police or where you obtain a drivers licence from? If you do have that they may even take him for a driving test.It the last of there indepedance and when that taken away it must be so hard for them,but you have to protect him and the other road users.Hope this has been of some help to you.	post_5498696
post_5863343	Jul 02, 2010	193490	18954	Pam	Hi, Pam--I'm new to this forum so just read your post. Is your Dad still driving?Some hospitals offer a driver's evaluation through their Occupational Therapy department. It's simulated in a machine-type setting, but they test brake response time, dexterity, whether you can adequately judge distances, etc. There is a charge for this, at least there was where my Mom went a few years back (about $100, if I recall correctly), and Medicare and insurance didn't cover it. They do not determine you cannot legally drive, but they provide a written report for your physician as to whether they think driving is OK or not. If your Dad would be open to this, that's something to consider as well. It gives hard data and you're not the "bad guy."The one my Mother took a few years ago (she did this twice, 10 years apart) also included a written test and she had to study a manual, like you do when you go for your temporary license. It looks at whether you know and can remember signs and other traffic laws, which is a very good thing.Take care,Yvette	post_5498696
post_5865891	Jul 02, 2010	547368	None	None	Welcome to our Caregivers Forum!Thank you so much for that information. It is valuable. I think every sate offers a bit different options. In our state the physician must complete a form if requested by DMV. Otherwise the person can drive as long as he or she can pass the eye test.Your license are good for six years. Unfortunately a lot can happen to a person, especially an eighty year old in six years. Indeed a lot can happen to any age person in six years!!There has to be a better way and it sounds like your state has found it.In our state they can't make a 65 year old do anymore to qualify for licenses then they can do to a 30 year old.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_5498696
post_5626429	Apr 29, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Wigout,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. Bless you for caring so diligently for your young granddaughter. Congratulations, you are officially a "Caregiver."    It doesn't matter what age group you are caring for....it is an extremely difficult task.From an outsiders perspective and as a grandmother myself (I was 32 when I became a grandma) I see two things happening. First Grandma is not the full time caregiver and does not have to be the "bad cop." This can also happen with parents. In my opinion, Grandma looks at the baby girl that she may have lost to cancer and can't see past that fact. Her love for this child clouds her better judgement to stand by you when you say no or make the rules and set boundaries.I also think you need a break. A long over due break from care-giving. You should be tired, very tired. I commend you for all you are doing. Can't Grandma take over some of these responsibilities? Is there no one else to give you a break? Grandma probably needs one too, though probably not as much as you do.We cared for both our granddaughter nearly full time. They were just 10 months apart. When their parents were divorcing we cared for the youngest one full time, she was ten at the time and she said and did horribly cruel things to me. Though I loved her dearly I got very tired of her misbehaving and manipulating in spite of the fact that I understood what trauma the divorce was having on her. I can't tell you how many times she said, "I hate you." So I do understand to a small degree what you are going through.In my opinion you need to sit down with your wife and explain what this is doing to you. Children need solidarity between two caregivers. When grandpa says no, grandma has to back his decision and visea versa. Children learn at a very early age who they can manipulate and are the best at playing one parent (or grandparent) against the other. That doesn't make them bad, that makes them normal. But together you can control this behavior to some degree. You cannot let this situation build a wedge between you and your wife. Your relationship has to come first or I am afraid that in time this stress will pull you apart.Find someone to take over your granddaughters care for a weekend and get away with grandma. Renew your commitment to one another. Bring your relationship to the forefront, where it belongs. Sometimes relationships get lost in all the responsibilities of caring for an ill loved one, especially a child.If all else fails I suggest counseling. It's not as much the child that is causing these issues as it is the lack of unity between grandma and grandpa in my opinion. You are correct that the child doesn't understand completely what is happening to her. She is too young to comprehend all of this. All she has know is a life of pain and illness, hospitals and doctors...and she may associate that pain with you because you were the one that was there. She has probably been scared out of her mind at times.But please find someone to give you the break that you need. All caregivers need that. Your feelings are normal. I have cared for my elderly father for eight years who became terminal 20 months ago. I too feel that I have given up my life to care for him. In fleeting moments I feel that he owes me too. Your feelings are all normal caregivers feelings. My father is eligible for Hospice which offers me a much needed respite now and again. Are there not similar options available for you?We are here for you. I find that sometimes just venting helps me. I wish you the very best. You are truly your granddaughter's knight in shining armour and some day she will recognize that fact and be eternally grateful. What you are giving cannot be bought.Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. My heart goes out to you.Take Care,~Tuck	post_5625635
post_5637977	May 02, 2010	82861	None	None	I agree with Tuck.    You seriously need a break.    Nobody can be expected to be a full-time caregiver for another person and still maintain their own physical health, mental health and marital relationship.    It's simply not possible.    No matter how much you love your wife and your granddaughter, nobody can live through that kind of stress without scars.    Check to see if Can Care is active in your area and contact them.    If you aren't a member of a church, call churches in your area.    Many have volunteers to help people in just your situation.    Membership is not required to ask for and receive assistance.http://www.cancare.org/You and your wife obviously raised at least one child together.    Were you able to present a united front back then regarding discipline and child rearing in general?    If not, then it probably won't happen now.    That doesn't mean you give up, but realistically if your wife's personality is to let a child lead her by the nose she probably isn't going to change.Don't forget to talk to your granddaughter too.    When she gets snotty, that's a teaching opportunity.    Go ahead and let her vent as long as it's a discussion.    She probably needs to talk about what's happening to her body but hasn't the vocabulary yet to communicate effectively.Make certain she knows the consequences of misbehavior BEFORE it happens.    For example, if she wants to do something that is medically prohibited and does it anyway, that gets her 5 minutes on the "naughty chair".    Same thing for talking back to you and your wife and saying hateful things to anyone.    Make it clear that kind of language will not be tolerated, and make it clear that the consequence is 5 minutes on the naughty chair.    Do NOT engage in an argument with a child.    You WILL lose every time and it only escalates the situation and gives her more power.    Just keep putting her back in her spot until she completes her 5 minutes quietly.    Stubborn children may pop up over and over again for an hour or more, but eventually they will give in as long as you can stay calm and keep your own mouth shut.Make some kind of reward system for good behavior too.    Maybe a calendar that she can paste gold stars on for every medical (or other) thing she handles gracefully during each day?    A smiley face sticker or a frown sign to help her let people know if she's having a good day or a bad day?    Set it up on her door like a "do not disturb" sign that she can change around depending on how she's feeling.    When you see the sign change, that opens the door for you two to talk about it.    Make the actual making of the sign a project that you do together with her.It's so easy to spoil a child who is so gravely ill, but it does her no favors to treat her as "different" from any other child.    Of course she's learning to manipulate the situation!    She's sick; she's not stupid.    :-)	post_5625635

I even think I was alittle defensive, but I'm human and do have feelings. I do have a sticker chart for her that has diffferent things on it that will earn her a prize from the box. She loves her stickers and also loves her prizes.I promised her I would buy her some color for her hair, but was having trouble finding it. Today I found pink and purple. She just loved it. She wants to go to school with the diffferent hair color.Anyway, just talking..........thanks againtim	post_5625635

post_5655713	May 07, 2010	547368	None	~Tuck	I hope those "eye opening" comments were good ones. If you learned some good approaches I hope you will share then with us.Please don't feel like you have to be defensive, ever. No one has a right to judge you unless they have walked in your shoes. And though I think I understand care-giving I cannot understand truly the situation you are facing. Children can be demanding and difficult. Yes they are wonderful and usually just need the right guidance but they can still be a huge challenge.Grandparents should be able to enjoy being grandparents and not forced into the role of being a parent....but that's in a perfect life and goodness knows most of us don't have a perfect life. I know I certainly do not!Personally I commend you for stepping up and being a parent. You could have made different choices. I think you made the right one, but certainly not the easiest choice.

post_5660395	May 08, 2010	1292698	None	None	i did go and see our therapist. She gave me some good advise also. She too see's Kayla on a regular basis. She says that Kayla is going through things that we really don't understand yet, and maybe might never. She is very close to her and she uses play or acting to get information from kayla. Kayla is very nervious about her leg. She doesn't like to show it to others. It is also very hard for Kayla to express how she feels. So the therapist advises me to just hold Kayla when she is crying and can't let me know why she is crying. Not to punish her and put her in her room. She also says that kayla is a child and needs to know that some things are not accepted. My wife and I are very tired. We have hired someone to step in and relieve us a couple of days a week. That will help. My wife and I are also going to see someone to talk toThanks again for all the comments.Tim	post_5625635

post_5666737	May 10, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	Hey wigout111, I am not dealing with my own family members but am paid to care for two young men who have behavoural issues. Men, you have to treat like adults and that is even more difficult but there is a way.Hubby and I are both care givers and we have contact with our guys together and in different timings as well depending on what one of us is doing.We made a plan when we first started this and it was never to fight in front of our care people. Then other plans came into effect as we went along learning ourselves and the guys.we never do it alone, we take a request and we tell a person, "let me think about it" and we discuss it alone and we both agree on how to approach it, not only for now but that same thing in the future (how do we want this to end up going?)We never yell at the guys or each other infront of them to give an answer to a request.There is no better person to ask for something this way. When it is a bad choice we try to make other choices along with the request and see if we cant get a person to see that they are not limited to what they wanted and they still get to make a choce and in the case of adults they need to have a choice, so should kids.As far as time off, you both need to take something for yourselves try to find someone who can handle children with behavoural issues and if that works out try it a couple of times, you just never know what it will do for you.I know grandma feels she is doing whats right but you are a team and need to look like a team to your grand daughter so she does not pick sides. Never take something away without making her see that you both came up with a better idea and it dont have to cost money, maybe a walk for an ice cream, all Together and with dog if you have one.I have seen care situations where the cared for person does not see a family setting so they might try to split it up more for their convienence and that is not comfortable for the caregivers and is later not even comfortable for the cared for person.Dont forget, if you suddenly want to give her something nice, plan it so you are both a part of it since she is gonna get it anyway, she may as well see both in her happy eyes at same time as she sees the item given.Hope this helps ome cos I know I could see your grand daughter in my two big guys if we didnt have this plan and I learned alot of it from others tips as well as what we took time to talk over and when a little thing works you make another and another.Also, have you asked the government whats available for help since she has dissabilities? there may even be some relief help plans around your area, dont know what state you live in and whats there but worth asking. I am in Canada and parents in some provinces can ask for respite help so they can take a week off now and then.BTW, bless you for what you do.	post_5625635

I know that is not the solution. Asking for help and suggestions is never a bad thing. It can only help.The truth to the matter is that I'm Tired. Very tired. Emotionally and physically. I thought taking care of her 24 hours of day, 7 days of week was hard. Now I've been back to work now going on 3 months full time and still helping here. Very tired. I'm planning a trip to my parents house in July for 3 days. Just me. Then we(as a family) are going on vaction for a week staying in a cabin on a lake. So there is giong to be lots of time for rest. Our Daughter in law just moved in for now to give us some relief. So I hope she works out and can step up to the plate.I just want to see the light at the end of the tunnel.Dinner timeThanks againTim	post_5625635

I sure hope you find as she grows she becomes easier and easier to deal with, lord knows she will be better for it too.	post_5625635
post_5701467	May 19, 2010	1292698	None	None	To everyone who cared enough to give me some great suggestions and committs.Thanks again for everything. Getting defensive can be very imbarrassing. I'm a very proud grandfather, and love my granddaughter to death. If I could, I would take her place in a heart beat. I sometimes talk before i think and mayhave spoken out loud. I am doing the best that I know how. I guess that's why I joined this group to reach out and get some help from others. Things are going to be just fine. I will keep you informedTim	post_5625635
post_5703541	May 20, 2010	547368	None	None	Thanks Tim,We all know how very difficult caregiving an be, no matter whom we care for or how much we love them. It's ok to be angry, frustrated and at your wits end. It's all part of the caregiving process. Don't beat yourself up for being human.The role is not easy but it is one that you will never be sorry you did. I gave up a lot as many of us do in order to be a good caregiver. Sometimes our efforts seem fruitless and unappreciated but believe me they are not.If you have a belief in a higher power, turn to Him. It does help.And we are always here for you. No one will judge you. Most of us have felt the same. There were times I was so frustated and angry I could hardly contain myself. It's ok.~Tuck	post_5625635
post_5705762	May 20, 2010	1292698	None	None	ThanksTonight is Thursday. I just got home from work. 9:51pm. Kayla got up and wanted to say goodnight. She sometimes waits up for me to come home just so she can say goodnight. Tomorrow will be my free day. Actuallly I think my first free day in a long time. I have someone to take Kayla to her therapy, and also to the bus. So It's my day to do whatever. I don't feel guilty!!! I guess that's okay. I willl have a good day.Thanks again for the reply. I like being pushed to try and do better for my granddaughter.Tim	post_5625635

I know that when you're right in the middle of the situation you can't always see it, but from an outside and objective observer, I think you're doing great.    Keep on doing what you're doing and congratulations for being brave enough to ask for help and admit that you need it.    :-)	post_5625635
post_5723674	May 26, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	They say what goes around comes around, I sure hope if you or your wife ever need help, one of your kids will be there to help too, you are doing a great job and just remember team work is all it is cracked up to be,    and yes, great that you vented here, cos it shows you are not alone by all of the responces you are getting.I have a friend who takes care of her father now that her mother is gone and as hard as it is she says she wouldnt let anyone else do it cos they always supported her when she had a child with dissabilities and now that he is out in care all is good for her to help her father cook meals and get around where he needs help. Poor lady has bin busy but life has bin good to her too, so she says, a very possitive person, we dont see as often as we would hope to see.Dont forget to look for resources in your area to see if there is any kind of help or programs that might give your grand daughter a place to go for a day or for people who can add extra help here and there. Some government groups do offer some stuff and lots of people dont even realize it.I dont know about your area but here in BC Canada the government offers parents of dissabled children some respite money to help them take a break a few times a month. I hope there is some kind of program like that for you.	post_5625635
post_5747036	Jun 02, 2010	1292698	None	None	I have a ?? about behavior in children.    It seems that when Kayla acts out and gets a time out or has something taken away, she will go almost 3 or 4 days with the same behavior. The next day, you would think that yesterday was over and all has been forgotten. At least that's what we do. We start over. But with Kayla, She tends to act out the next day, like it never stopped. Is she just mad about what happen yesterday, or is she trying to tell us something???.    We will talk to her therapist this week about it.What happened wasWe went to the park and had a great time. Spent almost 2 hours playing. She was walking without her walker the entire time. We wet to dinner and she had fun there too. We stopped at lowes on the way home and there she acted out. Screaming in the store. She did not want to use her walker there. We had talked with her before hand and said that because the store was so big that she needed to use her walker so she would not get as tired. The walker is very large and hard for me to carry.(I have a very bad back) So while she was screaming, I carried her out of the store and to the car we went. She screamed all the way to the car. I was trying to put her in the car seat and when I tried to put her seat belt on she would try and get out. All the way home she cried and screamed. When we got home, we tried to down grade the problems and start over. Turned a movie on and went to take her leg off.(she had been wearing it for hours) She through a fit and said that she wanted it on still. I explained that it was time to get ready for bed and she needed to rest her leg. She started hitting me. So I took her to her room and said she needed to go to bed. She then started throwing things in her room    This behavior last almost 2 hours. During this time, I took away her tv and said she could have it back when she stopped behaving this way. She contined. The day finally ended (thank god) The next day, She slapped her caregiver because she was asked to pick up her toys before school. She refused to pick up her toys she the carevgiver carried her to her room. Day three. We were in the back yard playing with the puppies and I notice her leg was on wrong. She was falling alot, so I explained to Kayla that she needed to sit down and play because of her leg. I didn't want her to hurt herself.(It';s very hard to carry her up the stairs and take the leg off and on) She said that she want to walk and play with the puppies. I said no, if you want to stay out here you need to sit down. She continued to walk. So I picked her up and carried her to her room. Of course she screamed and cried for a long time. Day 4 was normal.I really could use some suggestions on how to deal with a upset child. Do we just let her get away with things? Or do we put our foot down and make a stand. Hitting people is a no no in my opinion. If she does that at home, does she do that in school. I hope notTim	post_5625635
post_5751483	Jun 03, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	I think I mentioned above I have two young men with behavoural problems, the youngest has them really bad, he will scream when you want to brush his teeth and when some people move around him or leave a room or return, he hates a shave or shower, this was his way for 22 yrs with his parents cos they just didnt know what else to do. We have had him for two years now and he hardly screams anymore not even when people leave or when trying to do a shave or shower, which was worse then all other screaming and jumping.We tried to make everythig a game, if he thinks you just want to get the job done he will freak out but if we do something to keep his mind off of it he is ok to do almost what ever you want, we dont serve him candy for it, we just make sure someone else is able to be a slight entertainer like playing with a bright yellow pillow, anything colorful. Seemed like a long time that we had to do this but now he can take a shave, shower or even see people come and go without screaming cos he has gotten used to it now.Distraction is key in a lot of young people with these problems. His parents are amazed at him now when they take him home for three or four days. His dad couldnt take the screaming especially since he retired just before we took their young man permantly now he loves to come and get him for a three day stay.Problem for mom and dad was they were never caregivers and were in such a small community and they just didnt know the tricks of care giving.Also for this young guy, he has never been able to stay at any facility before us for more then three months, either mom didnt like the situation, (misshandling, or he was ordered out due to his behavours) and so they had to care for him all those 22 years. They were worried for the first 6 months we would want him out. We still have him and now would never trade him for no one or any other job.Just try to redirect and distract, it is not easy but you will find tricks and treats are not the answer, it will be expected.With our oldest guy redirect is his best option, he will do what you want if you turn his view around and give him something to do that he does like when he thinks he is bored and tries to go to an outburst.One more thing, our oldest was getting better with us but some things we could not concour, his ability to act up while out at his day program, we talked to his doctor about this and he gave him half of the smallest dose of anxiety medication and by golly, two days later his work program called us and asked what we did to him, he is a changed man, His parents are totally impressed now at how easy he is to manage. this is a recent thing so we will see how well it works in a few more weeks but so far soooooo good. Your grand daughter might be too young for a medication but no harm in asking a doctor if there is anythingt. This drug he is on seems to be training him calmness even after it is supposed to wear off later in the day.Hope something here will help.	post_5625635
post_5751526	Jun 03, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	Another thing I noticed in most people, If they see you get mad or show any reaction they will do again what they did to make it happen, if they see no reaction they tend to realize after a while there is no fun in what they are doing. sometimes carrying on what you are doing and coming back to try again with a different approach helps. I know you are having a hard time with this because it is hard to go through it with men who have bin like this all of their lives and it does take a while to break it at that point especially when you cant give em a time out cos they are adults, so just try everything you can and concentrate on it, she sees your abilities to work with it now and she will be better for it later, hopefully.We were asked to respite for a lady who lives right across the road from us, she is thirty and the parents never tried to calm her and they still dont, we said no, and that is not like us to say no but when you see the parents will not change, you know your work will never help her and I am sorry to say but you can see where she can, she does try but she now knows them as they are and will continue to do what she knows is a way of life for her to get her way.We must always remember when something is taken away from us we need to try to gain some control and that is exactly what dissabled people do, is nature and we have to try to show them choices    so they feel they are in control still.	post_5625635
post_5754906	Jun 04, 2010	1292698	None	None	Again thanks for the inspiration and suggestion. This site is really helping me in more ways that you can imagine. Out of everything that is happening and the things that Kayla and myself and wife are going through, i would do it again if I had too.My wife was told yesterday that Kayla has been through more in her 4 years of life that most people will go through in their entire life. That she might be just expressing anger and it will pass. Our biggest fear is that she will take after her mother. (Her mother has borderline personallity) and struggle in life emotionally. We will have to be the ones to pick her up when she falls apart. My daughter was a real challenge all through her growing up. Kayla see's her thereapist today and we will talk with her to see what she says.Today is good and I love my granddaught to pieces. That's all that counts for today.Tim	post_5625635
post_5756122	Jun 04, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Tim,Your challenge is huge but so is your love. I admire you so much.What works for one child doesn't necessarily work for another as Sally noted above. It will be a trial and error to determine what helps control your granddaughters behavior. It doesn't sound like time outs or taking away her privileges is very effective. Hopefully the therapist will have other suggestions.Consistency is most important as I am sure you have been told. One of my grand- daughters responded to treats. If she was good she got a treat, whatever was important to her. Before an activity or an outing we discussed what she could earn for good behavior. When she threw a tantrum (as she did now and again in the store) she did not receive the treat. My other granddaughter could have cared less for treats. They meant nothing to her. Time outs drove her batty. She hate them and if she misbehaved she got a time out.My youngest son had a star system. He earned stars for good behavior. Each star or set of stars as the system progressed took home to another level of a privilege or a treat, whatever goals had been set.What will work for your granddaughter will depend on her. As your wife said, she has gone through more than most have in a life time. Of course she must be angry. Striking another person is never acceptable. With your guidance she will learn how to redirect her anger and learn the correct way to handle anger. Now are her formative years.She is blessed to have you and your wife. I know how very difficult it is to be a caregiver to anyone at any age. Your love and concern will help you conquer what right now may seem like impossible obstacles.I hope you and your grandchild have built rapport with her therapist. She will be very instrumental in the process of caring for and raising Kayla.Bless you for all you do. We are a wondrous person and grandpa. Don't forget to find sometime for you and time to nourish your marriage.My best to you, your wife and grandchild,~Tuck	post_5625635
post_5757491	Jun 04, 2010	1292698	None	None	Well Kayla did see her therapist today. She told Kayla that if she doesnt; like what is going on at the time, that she has permission to leave the room and go sit in her room.    And that bad behavior will not be tollerated. I like how she worded it for her. That she has permission to go to her room. She is a good therapist and has Kayla in her heart. Today was a good day. My wife left for Califorinia today to pick up our other Granddaughter.She stays with us for the summer. So Kayla and I will have the weekend together. Also with our 8 puppies.Thanks again, and I will keep you all informed of our progress.Tim	post_5625635
post_5759894	Jun 05, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	That permission to go to your room if you dont like something is great, glad she is using that one, our guys have the same thing here, because they are adults they cant be sent to their rooms but they both know they can go there and it does work. Our oldest guy is pretty mobile and he uses that rule many times a day and it keeps him occupied very nicely. We have certain things he likes to do that stay in his room and he reads at the kitchen table and he has some musical items and other toy like things he keeps on the couch so the couch is basically his. He is neat about it when it is like this because things have a place for him and he has learned to put away what he was doing in his room to come out and do another thing on the couch or table. Structure is key and so is not having clutter. Once a person knows what is where and that they can go to a certain place to do different things it helps clarify life too which when less confusing is less frusterating.Lots of tricks to learn, even for us and yet sometimes we think we have it nailed, we come up with new tricks all the time that make things easier.This morning our young guy (who needs everything done for him) thought he would play with us, he layed there in bed stiffened out so we couldnt sit him up to get him out of bed, we went away to see if that would change his mind, we came back and he had a great big smile on his face, and again he stiffened out. I brought his legs up and hubby got behind him and as I lowered his legs hubby sat him up, Yahoo, he gets to eat breakfast now, but some day he will figure that one out and we will have to try another trick. He is not nearly as moody as he was when he first came but the difficulties are now in games, if he feels he has you he will do it again and again. Once he sees he has run out of trickes on one game he will try something else but at least he smiles about it now instead of getting mad like two years ago when he got here.Anyway, keep plugging away and when you figure out things that work for your garndaughter, dont forget to take note of it and share with someone else cos we never know what will work for someone. I keep seeing our young guys mom saying "Wow, wish I had thought of that while I had him for 22 years" And yet some of it comes from our two brains working together and some comes from others we have talked with which his mom never had in her very small community during her time of caring for him.	post_5625635

post_5807969	Jun 17, 2010	1292698	None	None	Haven't written in awhile. Things have been up and down, but we are dealing with it. Kayla's therapist says that we need to try timeouts in a chair other than here room. And if she can be quiet for 3 minutes, then she can continue to play. She really is a great kid. And we love her to pieces. I just thing that she has gone through alot    in her life (4 years) and she is just spilling out all the anger and frustration. She will get better as time goes on.Tim	post_5625635
post_5810641	Jun 18, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	I believe she will get better as time goes too. My guys both have behavoral problems and one who has bin here two years is showing huge changes to his parents and the other has bin here 9 months is already showing huge changes as well and neither was ever said to be able to do that.We recieve them with a story when we are given a choice to take them on, and both have a high rating of care needs mostly because of behavioral issues, when we hand them on to someone else some day the story will not be the same, infact we are starting to respite them out more and is working well when we have a history for both being hard to let out to other caregivers.I have to say, if we let an old habit happen just once when it tries to peek it's head out we have to deal with it for a while again to get rid of it. Our oldest can calm out if he starts something and it is nipped right away, he can take an evening, hours, or a day to calm out if he is allowed to carry on for 5 or ten minutes because then it is hard for him to get out of that mood, taking the same approach that works is what makes it work all the time and everyone being involved doing the same thing works too. It is called structure and people with these dissabilities need structure. Without it too many things look like a pathway to the mood and actions they want to fall into. This means meals and daily patterns too. I know some people who are great going to school 5 days a week and then the weekend messes them up. A friend who has a 14 year old gets her young guy up every day same time even on weekends and if he wants to laze around on weekends then so beit but if she doesnt he takes seizures and feels sick on weekends (maybe because he thinks she forgot him). He actually wants to do the same thing each day and he gives her hardly any fuss if she does it that way, not that you would have to do that, but you will find different things that will work as time goes, make sure what works is kept up according to aging tho, and adjust slowly to any changes needed..We do a (calming) chair too for our oldest who walks. If he gets on the wild side we tell him to go to the couch or table,(where everyone else is not hanging out at and yet a visible place) and he knows it is just till he feels better and he can come back to the area that was getting him going in the first place and try again. His program place once tried that because we suggested it and they put him in an office to cool off and the damages to paper work on the desk were nearly a chaos. They quickly learned it is not about putting a person away, like in a room all by them selves but to put them off to the side where they get a chance to cool off and realize they want to come back to the crowd but have to be calm about it.Re Direction is a huge help too, if she is acting on something try to think of something just to change the sceanery, our guy in wheel chair might act up and we turn his chair around to a new view, or turn off the radio and put on the tv. He gets no treats to change the mood but a new something to look at. The one who walks gets asked to go and do a puzzle or gather his cloths for the laundry and he does it now as if he just wanted to hear you say it for him so he could. Is funny how people want to please but they dont know how to startI would also be looking as time goes to see if she is at any chance of being bi polar or any other things like ADHD and other things that may surface as she ages due even to her hard start in life that she has had.I believe she is a great kid, mine are two awsome young men that no one else wanted to deal with and I cant say I would trade either of em for anyone else. They are now what I wanted to take care of no matter how rough it was in their beginnings with us, It is in everyone to be something special, we just gotta pull it out there and make it show.	post_5625635
post_5813722	Jun 19, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	I was in a rush yesterday and didnt get to say this part but, I am glad to hear you say she is a grest kid, shows you see the good in her that you can work with.I had a lady for two years, she was here a year before my young guy and then here for a year with him, she has moved on because her parents tought her so many tricks how to manipulate one or the other or even outsiders to get what she wants for her first 46 years of life. Then they realized they were aging and could not care for her anymore so the ministry needed to find her a home. We were her first home out of her parents care and boy was she a handful. As the second year came about I relized she is doing good but still wants to get what she wants because you couldnt kick it out of her blood to do so. I recommended to the ministry that she move on to a new face in her life and will need to move as often as it takes to give her a new look on life and so they moved her. She was an emergency to take at the time and we were asked to set some goals for her and get them accomplished and we did.Problem for her is 46 years of making sure she got what she wanted is never gonna go away. She lasted two years with us and only 9 months with the next and needs to move on again because her and new caregiver are not getting along already so I was right, problem now is they have to find a caregiver with the ability to deal with her issues that hopefully will last a while and yet she tries very hard to be the better person that is inside of her.She knows what her rights are as an adult and yet she does not know that these rights include responsibilities because the parents took care of all of that for her and she will never want to take those responsibilities now. An example is a cell phone, Yes she has the right to own mone but she needs to pay for it to run, or she has the right to be with your company but she needs to be reasonable while visiting with them and not act up.I hope all parents who read this can realize how making it right while young will improve their life in later years when they need to have someone else care for them.My youngest guy's parents thought they would let their young man out to care when he was 19 as an adult but they found it so hard to find anyone who would take him. His mom cries tears of joy when she is here visiting cos she now knows he should always be able to find a home now that his behavior issues are much less but she also says "where have you bin all our lives"? Both of them didnt know he could take a tooth brushing or a shave with a laugh instead of a fight,,, no kidding, he came here with full blown gum disease, Imagine brushing his teeth when he hates it but with fully inflamed gums on top. He is pink now and no more bleeding or transparent red infected gums, secret,,,, sensodine tooth paste, lots of playing infront of him while it is happening, a baby's tooth brush, and do not try to push it. we would try several times a day to get him used to it and now a full brushing everytime and no fight or punches to my gut. All this after twenty two years of fighting a no win battle with him done after a year of working with him at it. Shaving the same, mom used to try to hold him down while he swung and fought, we get to do a full shave, trim on a gotee which looks really cool on him and thinning it too so it is neat. Other care givers cant believe he wears a gotee because most care homes and group homes just shave it all off so it is done and on to the next job, we work with our guys to give them their own looks and he likes it now.We take him to restaurants and he doesnt get all exccited and make noise to scare others away. It is there in everyone to do what is right but best to find all that out early then to have someone else do it in later years, because now there are others who would love to have their loved ones in here to do what we do but being a small home share we can only take two unless we licence for more and that takes lots of money and yet the ministry tried to talk us into it and even pay for these upgrades needed to do it. Problem is, it turns this into a business and then our personal care that we do is gone to shift working people coming in, just doesnt do the same.Anyway, do what you can now so you will not be looking for something for her later that might now be there when she needs it. I tell lots of people this because I hate to see what we see in a person, when we know it shouldnt be that way even tho I can fix it, I can only do so much and there are so many that need it.	post_5625635
post_5813769	Jun 19, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	Sorry, I meant might "not" be there when she needs it.let us know as you discover things that work, never know, you might come up with a trick that might help me some day. I am still learning new stuff all the time and most of it from other caregivers or just giving something a try and getting lucky.I did say before that we do this as a job so we do make money for it but they live with us 24-7 and you cant imagine how good life is when you have two people with the best coming out of them nearly all the time so feel free to ask questions about different events or actions. There are lots of caregivers here by the looks of it and we all want to help.	post_5625635
post_5831724	Jun 24, 2010	1292698	1300526	Sallysmart	The days have been really pleasant this past week or two. Either something clicked, or Kayla is giving us a break. I hope that something clicked. She really has been in good spirits. Haven't had to give her a time out in some time. It's amazing on how good life is when you are not stressed all the time. And I'm sure that she realizes it too. As Parents, I don't think we understand the stress that is in the children. When they are punished for something and then punished for something else. It must seem like it will never get better. So they must continue to be angry and the parents keep getting stressed and the cycle continues. I'm realizing that I need to step back and review the situation and try and understand what Kayla is thinking. And then respond. Just maybe the situation will be better for both of us.It's lateThanks so much for the talksTim	post_5625635
post_5832670	Jun 24, 2010	547368	None	None	Thanks for the update Tim. It's always wonderful to hear about good progress.We can hope that your continuity and Kayla's counselling is having a positive effect of her behavior. It sounds like it is finally working.Pain and stress does terrible things to adults. Imagine what it must do to the little children of this world....like your Kayla. She in turn lashes out at what she cannot change, control or what she does not understand and you in turn, as we all would do, react to what appears to be hateful outbursts. It can become a vicious cycle.I think you are doing all the right things and it is showing in Kayla's behavior. Bless you for being such a patient and loving caregiver. There are special places in heaven for those that love above and beyond as you have done and continue to do.Please stop in any time.~Tuck	post_5625635
post_5835674	Jun 24, 2010	1300526	1292698	wigout111	Oh, so glad to hear it, I know just because you come here to talk that you will do well and so will Kayla. When I first started doing what I am doing it took me far by going to places like this, I have learned so much and it shows and the return comments from those involved in our people's lives is proving it all the time. I know there are some care givers in my situation who just let their person go on as they are just because they dont know that constant work will help. I have taken care of people in respite for other caregivers who I see improvement in my home for them while here and they come back with the same behaviors I saw last time they came in. Some people will not take a message from others that will help so there is no real improvement in the long run even tho those people show they have it in them for a weekend for me. I think you are working very hard at this and it will reward you soon if not as you said,,,already, great job.     :-)	post_5625635

I hope everyone with any interest in this often misunderstood issue will attend.Bladder control issues tends not not be discussed as often as it should be. Sadly many woman seem to find this subject a source of embarrassment and do not realize that there are often treatment options.Again Thank You,~Tuck	post_5823700
post_5796323	Jun 15, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Katy,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. My heart goes out to you and yours. Your family is facing multiple medical crisis, It sounds like your plate is over flowing and you are trying to console and comfort everyone. Bless your heart..I commend you for trying to care for all but caution you that you must take care of yourself first and foremost. You can't be everything to everybody though many of us try to be just that.I would guess that even more strongly felt then depression are the feelings of grief, sadness and helplessness.    Now is the time for your family to come even closer together. If you have Faith, draw upon it. Family prayer times and meeting with a spiritual advisor/counsellor can be very beneficial. It certainly helped us as my father went through the dying process.There are also some very good books available like, "When Bad Thongs Happen to Good People" written by a Rabbi and "90 Minutes in Heaven."I beleive it was written by an ordinary person like you or I. There are many other books and pamphlets available. They may help you with coping suggestions and give you insight and strength to share with your loved ones.There are also grief support groups for your aunt. Is she old enough to be eligible for medicare or did your uncle have Hospice? Those program also offer support in many different venues? Talk to your local hospital, ministers and Social Services Agency. They will know where the support groups or individual support out reach personnel may be found. Please my dear don't try to do this alone. It can't be done by one person.Often just allowing your family to talk about their health concerns or their lost loved one is very helpful. Don't shy away from discussions of fear, grief and death. If they reach out to you, let them talk.Are you familiar with the KÃ bler-Ross grief cycle? Dr. Elizabeth    KÃ bler-Ross identified and outlined the stages of death and dying that has since been applies to other major life changing events. This applies not only to those that are facing death and dying but those that are facing life altering challenges, such a cancer and chronic pain. There is a lot of reading available on this and I encourage you to familiarize yourself with it. It will help you understand and identify your family needs as well as yours. Please don't forget you in this equation.Just knowing that you love them and that you care will be comforting to your family members. A homemade meal for your aunt or others that are suffering with grief and illness can be very helpful. A "Thinking of You" card let's them know that you care. Family love and support is never over rated.A few weeks ago I lost my father whom I had cared for in my home for seven years. I still am dealing with major grieving. My sister that lives 600 miles away calls me approximately every other day, sometimes every day. She lost dad too. Her support and thoughtfulness is immeasurable. I have other family members that call or stop in at least weekly. These visits or calls are not always very long but they are just the right support that I need now. So pick up the phone often and let your ill family members know that you are thinking of them. Again Please don't under estimate the comfort of even a short call or visit. It all matters and says I love you and I care. I find smiles comforting, laughter is very difficult for me and not always acceptable...but we all face challenges and grieving differently.I hope that you will find something that I have offered beneficial in your challenges. Bless you for being so caring of your family. They know it and appreciate it. In the end they all have to make it on their own inner strength, all you can do is offer support and love.We are here if you need to chat or ask more questions. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers. Please let us know how you are doing.Peace,~Tuck	post_5792594
post_5793203	Jun 14, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello and Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. My heart goes out to you, your family and your grandfather. He is fortunate to have a loving family. Bless your heart. You didn't mention his age. How old is he? Is his wife living?Remember that a CVA (cerebral vascular accident or stroke) is a brain insult, a brain injury. It can change one's personality including their taste buds and their appetite. Recovery can depend a lot on attitude and determination. Your grandfather may be suffering from some depression and lacks the strength and will power to participate in rehab.Medications can also play a part in an older person's affect. He may be overly sensitive to medications and his body and mind are reacting to the foreignness of them. Is he being treated by an gerontologist, a physician that specializes in the care of senior citizens?    If not I would request an evaluation from one. I have sen them work miracles.Is there anything that your grandfather is hungry for? Can you bring in some home foods or take him out for lunch? I was surprised at how selective my father was i what he ate. He didn't have a CVA but he was certainly set in his likes and dislikes. He hated institutional food.Aggressiveness and anger often goes had in hand with brain insults. It may take time for this to resolve as the brain recovers. Unfortunately sometimes it never returns to pre-stroke condition.Is there a therapist at the rehab center that you can discuss these issues with in detail? Be involved. Let your grandfather know that he is loved and that you care. Provide him goals and objectives to look forward. Life can appear pretty bleak for an older, ill man. Men are use to the stereotype of being strong and healthy. This is especially so in the older population.Please let us know how he is doing. I will look forward to hearing from you again soon. Don't forget that your grandfather needs you all so very much right now, in spite of what he may say. Don't be discouraged this may take awhile. And don't hesitate to seek a second or even a third medical opinion.If your family feels he may benefit from another facility you may want to consider moving him but please consult his physician or get that second opinion. Not every facility is right for every body.My best to you and yours.Blessings,~Tuck	post_5789094
post_5665192	May 10, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Heiferly,Welcome to our Caregivers Forum. It's nice to hear from someone onthe other side, so to speak....a care-getter! :)You've asked a great question. I am sure that our members will have different answers for you....as we all tick a bit different.First of all Mr.McDreamy is there with you because he wants to be. He must love you very much. I am sorry that I do not know you or your condition well. I assume you require 24/7 care to some degree?I do not have your disease. However when I was about 30 I had a severe, supposedly unsurvivable MVA. I was in the hospital for nearly six months as they fought to save my life. It left me with multiple medical issue and severe chronic pain, thankfully no head injuries. My Mr.McDreamy has been at my side for twenty years now. Any man with any sense at all would have left me long ago!! I am blessed that he didn't have any!! :)I am also the caregiver of my 81 year old terminally ill father. He has resided with us for seven years. My Mr. McDreamy picks up my slack in dad's caregiving also. So I hope I can give you some input, maybe insight from both sides.We have respite for my dad. That allows for dad to go into a hospital or Hospice House to provide us with up to 5 days a month of respite. Getting away from the worry and concerns is immensely important. I have only used it twice since the terminal diagnosis 19 months ago but each time I have felt rested and renewed.Mr. McDreamy might need a night or two away. I don't know if you can get a sister or a loved one in to care for you or if the Home Health Care Agency will provide something similar to respite. McDreamy may not even want that. But certainly he may enjoy a night out with the guys, a movie or breakfast with his friends. Again I am assuming that he is there 24/7. My husband has breakfast with his friends once a week. He also goes to movies several time a month. Whatever helps him to unwind and get away. I insist.From a caregivers point of view I can say that repeatedly reminding me of what needs to be done is so annoying. My father will tell me five times in several hours that he needs meds reordered, even though I am the one who takes care 100% of all his meds, he has never ran out and I have already ordered them. That's just one example. It's like that with every task, or every need. So trust your loved one to see that these things are done....if he is the one that is responsible for them.It's priceless when dad simply says thank you, I love you or when he tells us that he appreciates all we do for him and that he couldn't get better care any where else.There isn't a day that goes by that I do not tell my husband many times how much I appreciate and love him, that my life would not have any joy without him. There are things that I cannot do and he just does them. Our nights of dancing, playing co-ed softball, tent camping and all the great activities we so enjoyed togther are long gone. But that is all that is gone.When I was very ill and recovering for years, he even helped me to and from the bathroom, comforted me when I cried in pain, held my head when I vomited and quickly retrieved meds that would help what ever medical problem I was experiencing. It wasn't just that first year. I had multiple major surgeries during the four years following the MVA and he was always there. I still have trips to ER, urgent physician appointments or pain flares when I can barely get out of bed. He has always rubbed my back in the middle of the night and promised his undying love.You can't repay those kinds of things. How do you repay someone for loving you to the degree that our McDreamy's love us? You simply love them back the best you know how. And loving comes so easy. Be attentive to their needs. Sometimes I get so caught up in my pain and carrying for my dad that at the end of the day I realize I have neglected my McDreamy. I am immediately ashamed of my selfishness. So I tell him.I never want to take him for granted. I tell him exactly how I feel. Open and frequent communication has been a effective building block in our relationship. My heart still skips when he walks into a room & he says he feels the same. We laugh whenever the occasion arises. Often we laugh over silly things that no one else sees the humor in & that makes us laugh harder. I don't know where this love & dedication came from. We are so very blessed. You must have the same or you would not have your McDreamy.I sincerely hope that my rambling has not bored you. And I hope that something I have said may have offered you at least some ideas or information. Please visit us often. We value all input. We all learn from one another...and support is critical.My Best to You and Your Wonderful Mr. McDreamy!~Tuck	post_5662928
post_5665337	May 10, 2010	612876	547368	Tuckamore	Thank you so much for your thoughtful, kind words.    You definitely hit this one on the nose in several respects.    It's comforting to know there are other couples out there doing this same thing and getting along just as we do (your description of seeing the humor in things that other people don't "get" is uncanny).My care is nearly 24/7, as you guessed.    I can currently be left alone for a few hours at a time between caregiver "shifts," but never can leave the house unattended (even to go into my own yard), and require assistance for almost all activities of daily living (bathing, meals, meds, etc.).    I have home health care for the hours that my Mr. McDreamy is at work, which leaves him in charge as soon as he walks back in the door.    One smart thing we finally did (though we resisted for a while, seeing it as an invasion of our available private time together) was to extend my home health care to seven days a week.    This frees him up to take overtime at work whenever he wants to without making special arrangements for me, and to do things for himself on his days off if he feels like it.    I think it ended up being a really good choice, even though it was a hard decision to make.My mother and her husband and my sister and her husband also take turns taking me out of town to stay in their respective homes for little "vacations" to spend time with family and give Mr. McDreamy a break a couple of times a year.    The funny thing is, he says he misses me when I'm gone.    I really couldn't be luckier.    I just need to make sure he KNOWS that I think he's the cat's meow, and I realize that it's not everyday you find someone who will stick it out in a relationship under as much stress as ours has had to endure.Thanks again for your input on this.    I think the biggest thing I probably need to work on is biting my tongue if something he does/gets for me isn't *exactly* how I want it.    I'm never that picky with my home health aides, and I think I just have a tendency to be more blunt with him because I'm more comfortable with him ... what's that saying about saving the worst of ourselves for the ones we love?    I owe it to him to be *at least* as respectful as I am with my aides, and show a little tact.See you around,-Heiferly.    :-)	post_5662928
post_5735816	May 29, 2010	547368	None	None	Sorry Heiferly, I didn't see your comment till now. As you probably know my dad passed became very ill the night of the 10th and passed away on the 13th.I've had little time for anything but grieving and doing the things I must do over these last several weeks.I hope you are still monitoring this site and will let us know how you are doing.You are so right. We often expect more and say so to those that we love. My grandmother use to say we should be as kind to those that we love as we are to guests in our home. It's easy to say but not always easy to do.I am glad that you have some mini-vacations. I am sure Mr McDreamy misses you when you are gone. Even when I was away those two short times from my dad who I was a 24/7 caregiver for, I missed him. And he was not dad, not Mr. McDreamy.I'll hope that you will keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. If you care to share the ways you have found to to show your appreciation I am sure we would be interested. We all learn from one another.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_5662928
post_5737348	May 30, 2010	612876	547368	Tuckamore	Tuck,My deepest sympathies on your loss.    My father passed away from severe illness when I was 12 years old, so I do empathize with what it is like to lose a parent; even when we know that in a way it is a relief of their suffering from illness, it is still so hard.    I hope you find solace in the time you were able to spend with him before he passed.    My thoughts are with you and your family.My guilt over being a "care receiver" in my relationship finally bubbled over ... more like blew up ... recently.    MrMcDreamy made an innocent enough comment about his disappointment about the fact that what he'd hoped would be a temporary illness has now proven to be something that forces him to give up some of the hopes/dreams he had for "us."    Instead of realizing it was an attempt to reach out and allow us to grieve together about the way WE've had to revamp OUR future together in light of my illness, my defense hackles went up and I took it as him blaming ME for my illness messing up HIS plans for the rest of his life.    I'll leave to your imagine the childish tantrum that ensued; fortunately, it was extremely short-lived and in under five minutes we managed to segue into the conversation he meant to have in the first place.Since having that chance to open up more about our feelings of guilt, grief, sadness, frustration, etc., I really think we've both been communicating better.    I think we go through waxing and waning periods where we communicate well for a while, then start to shut down again and stuff our feelings away, each trying not to "rock the boat."    Hopefully we'll get better at this as time goes by.As for ways that I show my appreciation, I guess you could say I'm a bit corny at times, but he seems to like it nonetheless.    (Thank goodness!)    Before becoming disabled, I taught young special needs children, and I don't think you could beat the teacher out of me.    So I tend to do lots of crafty/homemade things.    I made an arrangement of 3D oragami flowers and put it in a vase for him once; I know those went over well because he put all but one of them in our scrapbook and that last one he keeps on the fireplace mantle in the master bedroom!    :-D    Once I took about 30 of these posterboard stars that are meant to decorate school bulletin boards, and put personal messages/inside jokes/little drawings/etc. on the back of each one, numbered them (so it'd be obvious if any were missing), and hid them throughout the house for him to randomly find.His favorite gift he's ever gotten from me is a stuffed animal that I sewed from scratch using a pattern that I made myself.    There's a great story behind that one, the poor thing.    I'm a horrible perfectionist, possibly because I have OCD, or maybe just a personality quirk--but I had checked and re-checked this pattern a million times over.    Well, I was plugging away making the stuffed animal and I got all the legs sewn and stuffed and started attaching them to the body fabric.    I had all four attached before I realized that stitching them pointing all in the same direction was completely irrational; one leg and one "arm" were now on the outside of the body, and when I went to turn it rightside out, the other leg and "arm" were on the INSIDE!!!    Honestly, it's one of the deepest belly laughs I've had in my life.    I decided to keep the mistake as sort of a metaphor for my best intentions, but not always perfect outcomes, in showing my love for my SO.    To this day, you can see the seam allowances hanging out where the two missing limbs should be, and if you squeeze the body you can feel the phantom limbs buried inside.    MrMcDreamy LOVES that little stuffed guy and keeps him in a place of prominence on the bed.    :-pSo yeah, that's the kind of things I do to show my appreciation--lots of little notes, etc.    Plus I give him back massages when I'm able, as he has back problems and is often in pain after a long day at work.    I also have a general policy of letting him have "the clicker" when he gets home from work, as I can watch what I want during the day and he needs to unwind when he has the chance.    I'm happy just to spend that quality time with him anyway, regardless of what's on the tube.I did get a chance recently to switch roles with him briefly (which does happen on *rare* occasion):    poor bugger dropped a 25 lb. weight on his foot/ankle at the gym!!    So I sat up all night long with him in the emergency department, this time in the odd position of him being the one in the bed and me in the uncomfortable chair!    Thankfully, the x-rays came back negative for any broken bones so he got to leave with just a tetanus shot and some pain medication ... well, that and the same nasty swelling he came in with.    :-(    It was good to take care of him for once though!!    I even bought him breakfast at Bob Evans when the hospital set us free at the crack of dawn before we went home to crash in bed, just like he does for me whenever we end up pulling an all-nighter like that.    :-DOh, and the last thing I do that I forgot to mention that he really likes is that I do scrapbooks and DVDs of our memories together; he loves those.    When he bought the historic house we live in now, I made a special scrapbook just for the house with before and after pictures for all the restoration projects we're doing.    Well, we don't have all the "afters" yet, but you know what I mean.    I also put some of the history of the house in there, and general history facts from the year that our house was built--it's really neat and he was impressed when I gave it to him!    I've made several DVDs for us too, combining dated quotes from emails and notes we've sent/given to each other with pictures of us and setting them to music.    I even choreographed a music video (to a love song) featuring me, our dogs, and the aforementioned stuffed animal once and put that on one of the DVDs ... you have no idea how hard it actually is to get your dogs to roll over on command across "cue cards" of song lyrics while you videotape it until you actually try it, LOL.    Also, feeding them peanut butter to make it look like they are talking/singing *sounds* like it will work, but it sure didn't work well on my dogs!    Nonetheless, he always appreciates all the time and effort I put into these things and I can tell he really loves and cherishes the results, even if they're less than professional.Sorry for blabbing on so long.    I hope there's something of interest to someone in there.-Heiferly.	post_5662928
post_5739937	May 31, 2010	547368	None	None	Thank you for sharing with us. I enjoyed reading every word.I am so glad that you had that chat. You and your SO are going through the stages of the grieving process, which is normal when an injury or illness changes our lives.This may be more suited for your Forum but this is what I read, "Most victims of dysautonomia eventually find that their symptoms either go away or abate to the point that they are able to lead nearly normal lives. Sometimes, in fact, the probability that things will ultimately improve on their own may be the only thing that keeps some of these individuals going." Is that a truthful paragraph?Your relationship is not different from other relationships. I think we all wax and wane in our communication. No relationship is perfect. We all have our ups and downs, moments that we are closer and feel more connected than other moments. So it sounds like you are doing well.And it appears you have been successful in showing your appreciation. Keep in touch. It's always great to hear from you.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_5662928

The hole she left may never be filled but try to fill it with great memories and carry her love with you.I am glad that you have some assistance with the care of your sister.

We're all lifting you up right now.    Know that you do rightly, and never forget that your Dad made his wishes very clear.    In honoring his wish, you honor him, and also yourself I think.    God bless you my dear.    :-)	post_5667871

post_5639363	May 03, 2010	547368	None	None	Welcome Markie,I am so glad that you found our support group. We are few in numbers and welcome everyone who is a caregiver or know caregivers.Bless you for caring for you wife for so many years. You must love her very much. I hope she realizes how fortunate she is to have your support and caring.We know the many challenges that face we caregivers. As Kobuk said I hope you have additional support for you. Our needs are often over looked or must be put on the back burner. Our bodies and minds soon become weary and strained from the demands of 24/7 care-giving. However I would be remissive not to mention the many rewards among the challenges.We are here for you to chat or vent. Feel free to visit us often or post any time. We'll look forward to hearing from you soon.Again Welcome,~Tuck	post_5637918

Im new at this carer stuff 24/7 and im not coping to well at all,as for 16 years i have had all day to myself apart from working part time until 4 years ago when i physically couldnt go to work anymore.6 weeks ago i became a full time carer for my mother and i also have FM i dont sleep well,and have my own pain to deal with.Mentally im not coping to well and having to cook when im not up to it is becoming more difficult as my mother has terminal cancer as Tuck knows all to well taking care of her father.Good on you Tuck youre doing better than me.I feel i am under constant pressure and i have to be careful while my mum is on chemo due to the risk of contamination and that freaks me out.Also when i get a couple of hours off here and there i am so grateful but feel guilty and cant relax while im out.	post_5637918
post_5642608	May 03, 2010	82861	1276467	Loupa	Hi Loupa.    Demanding or not, the simple fact is that you ARE in demand and you ARE on call 24/7.    The constant worry you live with every day is incredibly stressful even if it's a quiet day.    Are you able to take any time for yourself away from your husband?    Will he understand that you aren't trying to run away from him, but need personal time to recharge your own batteries?    That's a conversation you need to have if you haven't done it before now.One of the hardest things I had to learn caring for my mother was to ask for relief when I needed it.    I could always count on my husband, but the rest of my family weren't the most reliable.    There was usually an excuse, but on the rare occasions they stepped up I was always grateful.    Asking for a break has always been terribly difficult for me.    Over the past year of one disaster after another not only with my mother but in my personal life, I finally learned a big life lesson.    Humbling myself to not only ask for help but gratefully receive it is grace.We caregivers are so close to the situation that it's easy to believe others should intuitively just "know" we need a break.    Well, they don't know and they can't read our minds.    They have to be told exactly what you need and exactly when you need it.    Nobody is a mindreader.    Whether it's someone to help with doctor visits or simply to come over to the house and be with your husband and watch a movie with him for a couple of hours, you have to be specific.Sometimes people say, "Let me know if you need anything" but they don't really mean it.    Always be ready to take an offer of help!    You'll learn soon enough who is sincere.    Keep a written list handy so you're always ready with a task when an offer of help comes your way.    If the offer doesn't come, you have to take hold of yourself and ask.    If the answer is no, move on to someone else and try to forgive the refusal.Can you think of anything you can do so you don't always feel on call?    Are there people you trust enough to take care of him so you can do something for yourself for even an hour?    Is it possible that the feeling of being on call is self-imposed?    While it's wonderful that you've devoted your life to caring for your husband, you must not neglect your own life.    You are a living woman who is not ill, but might be with the constant worry.    You can't live your husband's life for him, nor should you define your life by his illness.    You are You.    And you are important, and you have your own wants and needs that should not be neglected.Start small.    If you find yourself wanting to do something but hold back because "something might happen", try to redirect your thoughts back to your original mission: doing something for yourself without worry.    Easier said than done, I know, but with practice I think you will eventually not feel so tortured.	post_5639429
post_5643899	May 04, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Loupa,I hear you...and my heart goes out to you. No one understands the stress and 24 hour commitment that goes hand and hand with care-giving. You are on call 24/7 rather they need something or not. You "ears" are always tuned in. I find restful sleep difficult for fear that I will miss a call for assistance. I am often exhausted.I'll try to make my story short. I care for my 81 year old father who came to live with us eight years ago after a second compression fracture of his spine, following 2 back surgeries in previous years.. At the time he was fairly independant, drove his own car and had an active social life with his girlfriend. I still found myself hurrying home to cook a meal to his liking, turning down invitations to social events and assisting him with many things. In December of 08 he was diagnosed with end stage lung disease, asbestos lungs. I had given up much of my own life prior to that diagnosis but now I find that I seem to have lost my identity and am have become a solely a caregiver. In my opinion that happens to many long term caretakers.Hospice has been involved since the end of October of 09. They provide many in-home services and a volunteer that will sit with my father for short internals. I encourage you to check with Social Services to ascertain if you are eligible for any such services.I suffer with chronic pain and I have found that it is very important for me to take care of myself too, though that is often not easy and sometimes impossible. Caregivers need to care for themselves before they can be effective caregivers for anyone else regardless of the relationship with the person you are caring for. So please don't forget about you.One of the things that I have found very helpful is to come to MedHelp daily. Here I find support, understanding and comradely, not only for my role as a caregiver but for the challenges of the chronic pain I live with daily. I encourage you to do the same. I can lose myself on one of the Forums and still be available for my father.As Jaybay said family members are not always helpful. because of my nursing background it has been assumed that I will be the primary caregiver. They do not understand the demanding schedule and stress that being on call 24/7 presents in our lives. Often care-giving falls to one member of the family. If you have children, siblings or a neighbor that will offer you a break I encourage you to ask for their assistance. Even with that I find I am never completely away form the situation but at least it provides a little break from the daily routine of tasks.What we haven't discussed is the blessings that come with care-taking. Knowing that you are keeping your loved one at home and making their last years, months or days as comfortable as possible. Hospice Staff tell me that if it were not for my care my father would not have survived this long, nor have been as content. Right now he still has some quality of life but as the weeks pass I see that dwindling. But I am here to give him a hug of encouragement and tell him how much I love him and what a great dad he is and has been. Those things cannot be measured and would not be found in a long term care setting. I am sure that you my dear, are doing the same for your husband without even realizing it. You should be commended for your love and devotion.There are no easy answers for us. Just remember to care for yourself. Look for and take breaks whenever possible. Explore and utilize any services available to you and never, never feel guilty for taking care of you or finding time for yourself.Last but not least, don't forget that we are here for you. We will always listen to you rather you need to vent or just chat. Please keep in touch and feel free to post any time.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_5639429
post_5644129	May 04, 2010	1191512	None	all	I come from a family of 7. I see some of you feel that all the work is on you who    have a family memeber living with you. My father also needs care. we as a family had decided to put Dad in a home. But my oldest retired brother decided him self he would live with him. Now that it has been 5 years he is screaming at us he needs help. The 6 of us still thinks dad should be in a home. It was my brother decison to keep Dad.The rest of us    still have children at home . If Dad was to come to my house he wouldnt even have a bed. He would be on my couch in my living room.I try to help with but it isnt good enough for my Brother..we all do try! Now that it has become to much work for him and his wife to care for Dad he thinks its all of our fault.I feel for all of you who have decided to be the caretaker, But I sometimes feel it shouldnt be pushed on the rest of us. Dad knew how all of use felt and was alright with decision.I had my Mother in my home for a 1 year before she past. My oldest brother did nothing for help not did I ask him.i just wanted to vent	post_5639429
post_5646797	May 05, 2010	82861	1191512	wonderland610	Vent away!    That's what we're here for.    :-)The reality of taking on the role of caregiver is far different from what we imagine when we take on the responsibility.    Who knows?    Maybe your brother took in your father because he felt guilty about not helping with your mom.After 5 years and your dad likely getting much worse, of course your brother needs help.    If it's physically impossible for you and the rest of your siblings to make a meaningful contribution to your father's care, then you all need to sit down and have a calm, rational discussion about the situation.    Not easy, I know.    Anger and blame won't solve the problem.What are your father's medical issues?    Is that what is overwhelming your brother now?    If so, I'm certain it shouldn't be a problem for Medicare to pay for an aide to help out.    Hired help is one way for your brother to keep Dad in his home without losing his mind.    If your dad needs skilled nursing, that's a different kettle of fish and he probably does need to go to a nursing home.    Not that I'm impressed with any of them.    Someone still has to check in every single day to keep the staff involved.There are options available, so hopefully your brother and all of you can arrive at some kind of reasonable compromise for your dad.    Unless you all get involved to figure out a solution, nothing will change except for the worse.    It's a time for complete honesty without anger, finger-pointing and blame-placing.    Believe me, I understand having gone through the same thing.    Usually if someone steps up and acts like an adult the others will follow.    And vent any time.    :-)	post_5639429
post_5520900	Mar 30, 2010	82861	724066	Kobuk	I can't tell you how sorry I am to read of yet another person going through the exact same thing that I did these past few months.    I also had to deal with the DNR papers for my father in 1994.    He was dying of cancer, and SHOULD have died in February 1994.    The doctors ignored the DNR and coded him.    Words can't describe how sad and angry and upset Dad was.    He said, "You mean I could have gone and not even known it?    And they brought me back to THIS?!"    If the patient can respond at all - even a grunt - many docs and hospitals do not honor the DNR.    A family member needs to present at the time of the crash to enforce it, but many times even that doesn't help.I know this is the last thing on your mind, but check with your attorney about what will happen after your Mom passes.    Even if you all are appointed guardians of your mother now, I believe that status over her finances is null and void once she passes.    Without a will and appointed executor, you'll probably have to go back to court to have one of you appointed executor, etc.    Each state has different statutes in these situations, so it's best to find out now what you'll be facing.Having just lost my own mother last Friday, I empathize completely with you and your family.    May God grant you peace and grace now and in the days to come.	post_5516310
post_5521156	Mar 30, 2010	547368	None	None	I am sorry that you are going through this horrid process. My heart goes out to you and your family. Never feel like you are dumping on us. We are here to support one another.In that respect I am more fortunate than some. My father, who lives with us and I am his caregiver has made it as easy for me as possible. Shortly after he came to live with us seven years ago we discussed POA, etc. I found an attorney for him and he went on his own to have his will drawn up, Durable POA and POA for Health Care done. Unbeknown to me at the time he had it all immediately activated and appointed me to make all his decisions.My Dad is in the dying process now. He too is a DNR. He made that choice. I know that every state is different but in my entire medical career I have never seen a DNR not be honored. My best friend, closest friends, sister, nieces, SIL and this list goes on are all in the medical field. We have discussed DNR's and none of them have seen one not honored. In my state you can and most likely will be sued for not honoring a DNR status. You cannot legally resuscitate someone who does not want to be resuscitated...as long as they have a DNR in place and the facility has a copy of it.If they are unaware of that status than they cannot be held liable.I don't know if your mom has property or monies to be concerned about. If so you may want to have a family memeber apply to be her Durable and Health Care POA . In my state they usually will look to a family member to assume that responsibility. Remember the guardian appointed by the state will get paid and it will come out of any monies that your mother may have. It is usually best in my opinion to have the person "in charge" be a family member.You will need a lot of support during the coming months. I hope you have a good relationship with a sibling(s). As most can attest this may pull at family relationships. Try to be the peace maker if the challenge arises.We are always here to support you the listen. Sometimes just being able to vent or discuss what is happening helps. At least that has been true for me.Best of luck to you and your family. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers.~Tuck	post_5516310
post_5528254	Apr 01, 2010	82861	None	None	We briefly considered suing the hospital over the docs not executing the DNR order.    They ALL had copies of the document - the hospital, nursing station and individual docs.    I remember my Mom throwing a huge fit and screaming at them as Dad was resuscitated.    In the end, Dad lived another 3 weeks and none of us was up to facing a court battle.    I'm certain that happens with many families.    My sister wants to sue the nursing home that Mom was in, but I can honestly say I'm not up for it.    Mom wouldn't want us to use the money for that either.You are so right on the POA issue.    They really need to be immediately enforceable.    Mom chose the other option: executable only if a doctor determines her to be disabled.    That caused no end of problems not just for the family, but for herself.On the guardian issue, so much depends on individual state statutes.    It's up to the judge here in TX to decide if a family member or other individual will be appointed as opposed to a court-appointed guardian ad-litem who must be paid separately.    Of course, any attorney can explain that process to the client.I can't tell you both how many people have told me that they are grateful to have learned so much about end-of-life planning through hearing about our difficulties with Mom, and now with you too, Kobuk.    It's a crying shame that many families don't have these discussions well before disaster strikes.Kobuk, please try to check back in with us as time permits.    We're all here for you. :-)	post_5516310

post_5539777	Apr 05, 2010	144586	None	None	At the age of 103 my little one was getting weaker and not eating. A decision had to be made as to whether or not to ger a peg. I asked her and she said "I want to live". The doctors all wanted a DNR and were ready to speed her on her way.    A peg was put in which she tolerated well without discomfort. That was two years ago. She is now over 105 years old, put on ten pounds and is going strong. A happy-pie. When she was brought home from the hospital she said "I've never been happier in my life".Now I am not saying that a person shouldn't die with dignity, but I do know that physicians often push a DNR and a peg in the elderly.Whatever you decide, don't feel guilt, but think over everything carefully.	post_5516310
post_5551120	Apr 08, 2010	547368	None	None	Kobuk,I am so glad that you brother is at your side. You will need all the support you can get. The two of you can lean on one another. You'll be surprised to see how one day you are the strong one and will support him....and the next day it will be reversed. At least that is how it's suppose to work...and usually does when there are good relationships in place.Please keep in touch. We are here for you too.Kitty,My dear friend these are terms that you wil have to learn all too soon. Maybe you already do. POA= Power of Attorney. There are several types. I am my father's Durable POA and his POA of Health Care. Meaning I make the decision on his monies and his health care. He has a will in place and I am also the executor. The will and the POA documents to a great degree tells me how to make decisions (according to his wishes).DNR=Do Not Resuscitate. That's pretty self explanatory. When you have a signed DNR in place and that person stops breathing or their heart stops beating you are not allowed to do anything heroic to restart the heart of maintain breathing. In other words you let the person pass. These are usually signed and instituted when someone has a terminal illness or they are very frail and elderly. These are usually cases when resuscitating would not return them to normal function. It would only prolong the inevitable and in most cases prolong their suffering.As Caregiver said this has to be a personal decision and well thought out. Hopefully the patient is able to make his or her own decision. It's much more difficult to make it for someone else. I think it is imperative that we talk to those that we love and know their wishes before we every get in situation that we must make guess decision for them.Hope these explanations helps.~Tuck	post_5516310
post_5559445	Apr 11, 2010	549511	None	None	Oh i am silly !! I just never heard of them being abbrievated before. We have enduring power of attorney and thats permenant and POA is only temporary.I didnt know that they asked people if they wanted the DNR. My grandmother was ressusitated to live many months more in pain,and she was 86 how stupid is that but it didnt not affect her mental alertness and that was sad.	post_5516310
post_5559640	Apr 11, 2010	547368	549511	kitty51	You are so right...regarding DNR's. I have seen it both way. In my early years of nursing an alert and oriented elderly patient stopped breathing. She had no terminal illness, nor was she in pain. Her daughter was an acquaintance of mine. She did not have a signed    DNR. I began mouth to mouth and instructed my staff to get her Doctor on the phone and another to to contact the daughter. The physician ordered (via phone) for me to stop mouth to mouth (her heart was beating on it's own). I refused to follow his orders. Before the daughter could be located the patient began to breath on her own. Had I not breathed for her at the very least she certainly would have had some brain trauma, due to lack of oxygen. The daughter thanked me endlessly. (What happened to to her to make her stop breathing is a long complicated story.) The patient returned to her normal functioning level but the family dismissed the physician. This patient lived another 6 years to enjoy her grandchildren and children. She died one night in her sleep.    That's a happy ending for everyone but the physician. I have seen many more unhappy endings but it is usually when the heart stops also.POA in the states can be permanent or temporary depending on how it is written and the situation. Durable is basically financial. Health wise it is called a POA for Health Care. Those are permanent until or unless they are changed. Upon hospitalization every adult patient is approached to sign a POA for Health Care, at least in my area that is true. It doesn't matter the age of the adult patient or their condition. That document contains your DNR wishes.I agree with you that it was stupid to resuscitate your 86 year old grandmother just to allow her more time to suffer. Unfortunately in my state the medical staff are generally required to do so unless their is a DNR in place. Hospice has made in certain that when ever my father leaves the house he has a DNR bracelet on his wrist, even though he never goes any where with out me or my husband. I am sorry that this happened to your grandmother. We learn from these experiences.~Tuck	post_5516310

I have been forcibly ordered out of several nursing homes and two hospitals at gunpoint by security over the years by insisting that appropriate medical care be instuted that would mean the difference between life and death. And when all is said and done you find they lie (surprise), alter nurses notes and medical records to reflect examinations and visits that have not been performed and few seem to know the meaning of the term "medical ethics".. I have had experience in nursing facilities in several states and the quality iof care is usually substandard in the best of them.I will say a prayer for your mother tonight.God bless.	post_5508177

post_5514695	Mar 28, 2010	547368	None	All	My father seemed to really like the following poem. It was on the back cover of a pamphlet the Hospice gave him regarding the dying process. Apparently it is a nationally known poem although I had not seen it before I read the pamphlet. I beleive it was written by a nurse. I thought I'd share it with you all.Gone From My SightI am standing upon the seashore. A ship at my side spreads her white sails to the morning breeze and starts for the blue ocean. She is an object of beauty and strength I stand and watch her until at length she hangs like a speck of white cloud just where the sea and sky come to mingle with each otherThen someone at my side says; "There, she is gone!""Gone where?" Gone from my sight. That is all. She is just as large in mast and hull and spar as she was when she left my side and she is just as able to bear her load of living freight to her destined port.

post_5515272	Mar 28, 2010	82861	None	None	Many thanks to everyone for the thoughts and prayers.    :-)    I don't blame myself; I blame the nursing home and oddly enough, my mother herself for refusing to go assisted living two years ago.    The fall that broke her hip on March 10 was the last straw on her already overtaxed body.Regarding death and dying, I wonder if anyone has ever seen this happen before.    Mom has lived with incredible pain due to nerve compression in her entire lumbar spine and the lower half of the thoracic spine.    After she broke her hip, nothing touched the pain.    The last two days of her life, she said the pain was gone.    Just... gone.    She was able to lay straight in the bed where she couldn't for the last 6 months.    Was it a result of brain damage from lack of oxygen?    Maybe a miracle from God that she didn't have to die in that awful pain?I am so glad that Mom died at the hospital and NOT at that horrible nursing home.    They bought us enough time for family to say goodbye and one more visit from our pastor who Mom fell in love with.    There IS some sweet mixed with the large dose of bitter.    :-)	post_5508177

post_5541237	Apr 06, 2010	547368	None	kitty	Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. We are glad that you have joined us.Bless you for under taking this difficult challenge. In my opinion it will be the hardest thing you have ever done...but the most rewarding thing you have ever done also.It is not unusual for a terminally ill person to worry about those that are left behind. Your Mum is well aware of the personal health issues and how you have struggled with them. She is probably worried how you will cope without a mother.My previous experience in death and dying and now my personal association with Hospice has taught me to reassure my father that though I will miss him I will be ok. He too has expressed concern to Hospice Personnel about me and how I will "go on" without him in my life. My Dad has always been there for me. We have had disagreements at different time through our lives but we have always been best buddies. I am not as confident I will be ok but I don't let share that with my father.I am sure that your Mum is having some of these same thoughts. In time the two of you may want to discuss her passing....you'll know when the time is right...just keep your eyes and ears open.My heart goes out to you. I know how very difficult the path is that you have chosen. Caretaker is correct....never let guilt over take you. Do the best you can, that's all you or any of us can do.We're here for you. Please feel free to share with us again.~Tuck	post_5538310

The more care my father requires the higher my pain levels become. Chronic pain in itself can be difficult to manage then add care-giving to it and it can become a monster. Sometimes there is just no juggling.But as with you I feel better with my father in my home. I know he is being taken care of and he is where he wants to be. I am sure that is the same with you and your mum.I have no personal experience or knowledge regarding a Bowen Therapist. Another MedHelp Forum may have better suggestions in that area.Hang in there Kitty. We're all in this together.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_5538310

post_5922975	Jul 17, 2010	193490	1338685	paddiwack	Possible causes of frontal lobe atrophy include brain injury, brain tumors. hydrocephalus (which can cause headaches and apathy), excess alcohol intake, various forms of dementia, etc. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis or CNS lupus can also cause cerebral atrophy.I'm not a doctor and I'm not saying anything is wrong--but if I was told this and I was also    starting to feel not as sharp as usual and somewhat apathetic, I would pursue it further and make sure something that's treatable isn't being missed.You're only 63. You might want to ask the doctors, "How does my MRI compare to the MRIs of other 63-year-old patients you've seen?"I would definitely make sure you're doing things you can to help maximize brain function--Eating omega-3-rich foods, blueberries, green tea, apples, etc.; regularly doing crossword puzzles or other word games, staying as physically active as you can (as your doctors allow), staying socially connected with family and friends, etc.Good luck,Yvette	post_5775087

It sounds like you have had a spectacular memory your whole life, so don't let things like that worry you at this point. If it is becoming more of a habit that you turn the stove or oven on and forget about it, turn a timer on for a few minutes right after you put something on the stove or in the oven. That way, if you forget about it, the timer will go off and remind you. Unfortunately, the memory deteriorates as you age and everyone's deteriorates at a different rate. If it starts to become worse and you are worrying more, don't be afraid to talk to your doctor, that's what they're there for!! Keeping your doctor updated never hurts.	post_6254507

Not very reassuring when you are faced with high med costs and have no way to tell if it is really slowing his disease    progression or if it would be at the current pace without the med.	post_6191442

post_6483722	Dec 25, 2010	1543222	None	None	As stated before, Aricept only slows the progression of Alzheimer's. Most (if not all) medications specifically designed for memory related to Alzheimer's only slow the progression. I know that's not something that is easy to hear. Something that also may slow the progression is working the memory. When you are visiting, bring up old memories and re-live them. Do memory games. Work on puzzles. Read the newspaper or books. Work on hand-eye coordination by thossing a ball around. These things help, but there is nothing that will completely stop the progression. I'm very sorry, I know it is discouraging.	post_6191442
post_6353135	Nov 13, 2010	193490	1498179	julianovakia	I think the next step is getting your mom in to see her doctor. If you live a ways away and can't go with her to the doctor's appointment, I would call her doctor before she goes in for the appointment and tell him/her what happened that day. You probably will not be able to have a two-way conversation about your mom with the doctor or nurse (meaning, to ask questions about her condition or care) unless she has signed a release of information form because of strict medical privacy laws---BUT you are still allowed to call and tell them your concerns. This can be frustrating, I know....What I have done in the past about both of my parents' health problems is called the doctor's office, asked for their FAX number, and then faxed a short note to the doctor's attention. I briefly state my concerns, what's happened, what we've observed, etc. I always thank them for their time and attention and for caring for my parent and give them my name and phone number in case they want/need to reach me. This has worked pretty well over the last 5-10 years.I can understand your concerns about your mother, given your grandmother. I'm saying a prayer for you and your mother.My father was diagnosed with probable dementia this year--It's a very hard situation and hard to imagine if you've not had a loved one go through it before.

While I know this can happen there are usually signs of the confusion before where they were masking the problem.    I would go to the doctor and have some labs done.    A UTI (urinary tract infection) can cause increase confusion and balance issues for people in the older years (75+).Good luckJosh	post_6327011

I would definitely get her checked out as it may be something totally unrelated to the brain.    Many infections have that type of confusion effects, or side effect to a medication or something else environmental.    You are in my thoughts and prayers.	post_6327011

The surgery was done on August 3, 2010, and I have 2 big floaters swirling directly in the vision of my sight, along with 100 or so very small spects.    They don't seem to be getting smaller or dropping down out of sight. They are the same size they were after the surgery and the head doctor has confirmed that they are pieces of the cataract that were not removed. I have never had floaters and the opacity in my right eye was really not that bad. I had the surgery because of it's tremendous success rate (98%), thinking it would give me 20/20 vision, which would have been great because of the endeavors I have.

When I first read your thread, I thought Lyrica is the answer.    Sure enough, that's the first thing the doc prescribed.    It's really too bad you can't tolerate it.    I have Fibromyalgia, or let's just say I've had all of the symptoms. I asked for Lyrica (I'm a nurse) and lo, and behold, I'm a new person.    I just could not go on with the terrible pains in my shoulders and arms and more pain if I raised my arms.    I sincerely hope you will find the answers to your problems.

There are any number of conditions that could cause this but the first thing that comes to my mind is Parkinson's. I am a nurse.    I'm assuming your mom is in no pain or discomfort.    However if this condition is so pronounced you should use all your wherewithall to get her to a doctor. The doc will probably refer her to a neurologist.    Remember, you cannot get a diagnosis on this forum.    Anyone would only be guessing. The sooner you get her to the doctor the better you will feel.    I'm sure this must be causing you some anxiety since you posted.    So do it for your mom and for yourself.	post_6067363

post_6173030	Sep 23, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Pleiad007,My heart goes out to you!!! How very, very sad. Please except my apology for my tardy response.There ARE others in your situation or a similar situation. I must be off today as my computer is having some problems and must be repaired.    There is a post from the man that is caring for his parents over long distance on the Senior Health Forum. I will try to connect the two of you when I return tomorrow or maybe you can look too.But caregiving is caregiving. Each situation may NOT have the exact same facts but it is all very similar.    Caregiving can be and often is Heart Wrenching but from experience I can say it also has it Rewards. You may not see it that way now but I promise you that in time you will.It sounds to me like you are being a wonderful support. Your 3-way conversations, phone calls and all are priceless. As time goes on IF this becomes a terminal process there will be Hospice that you can work with long distance. Your support right now is so very important.....however you can give it.When my father was terminal my sister called me everyday for many months. She lives over 600 miles from us. I was the Caregiver and she my family support. I cannot tell you what those calls meant to me. It was like she was right beside me and I am sure your sister feels the same way. I could feel my sister's love and hugs come across the phone and into my home. So don't sell your support short. It means very very much to her.I understand how challenging your Bipolar II Disorder can be, especially as it may relate to this situation. But you'll do better than you think. Some where we find the strength to help those that we love regardless of your personal challenges ....and you will also. You will not fail your sister.Of course you love your sister....and the fear of losing her can be paralyzing. We'll help you deal with that but grief and loss is an individual and often lonely process.    No one knows exactly your grief but those of us that have been their have a very good idea.I have an appointment to have this computer repaired this morning. So I won't be back till tomorrow. But I will chat more with you than. I sure hope you are still monitoring this post.We also have an excellent Ovarian Cancer Support Community on MedHelp. You can find it under our Forums listing. If you can't find it I will provide you with a link when I return.Again I hope you are still "here" with us. I will be back either later this evening or tomorrow. You'll be in my thoughts and prayers.My Best to You,~Tuck	post_6166835
post_6178093	Sep 24, 2010	1452620	547368	Tuckamore	Thanks, Tuck. It's very encouraging to know that support can actually come from far away, as your sister did. "Paralyzing" is exactly the word for my situation. I'm on call to fly to TX at any time, causing an underlying state of anxiety. Will my house be orderly enough to take off in 24 hours? Do I have all the food and supplies ready to move my cats to my son's house (he's been a great cat sitter). I'm trying not to obsess so much, tough to do with BiPo II.As per your suggestion, I joined the Ovarian Cancer group.For sure, I'll be here! This site is terrific...I've deleted all of my complicated spreadsheets now that I have MedHelp trackers.Blessings,The Lost Pleiad	post_6166835

Also you will remain assured. You must have a look at New Jersey Home Care services. Expert and professional care, along with the human approach is ideal and must be opted for. From critical illness management to providing companionship, they undertake all of it with utmost care and concern. Go for it.	post_6166835
post_6295516	Oct 27, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Lynnkay,Please forgive my very tardy response. I have had some major challenges with my health, family health and several deaths. Unfortunately I have had little time to spend on MedHelp.I am so very sorry I missed your post and even more sorry to hear about the heavy responsibilities you are carrying. My heart goes out to you.I wish I had a magic answer for you. I do know from experience that your health must come first. It is tragic that the system has failed your son. No matter how much you love him it sounds like his issues are beyond your control. They are influencing your physical and mental health and you must take care of you.If you feel that you require hospitalization by all means seek it out.I don't have good suggestions for your son. Sometimes we have to let go and let God. It sounds like he needs proper professional assistance. I am sure you have been to all the agencies that exists in your county for help. But keep knocking on their doors. Sometimes the squeaky wheel gets oiled first.What would have happened had you not gone to pick up your son from the hospital? Would they have intervened and offered an alternative placement?If you are involved in an organized religion maybe they will offer some options.We are here to support you. My tardy reply is not typical, We do care. And I hope that you will let us know how you are doing. Again remember to care for yourself first.Best of luck to you.Take Care~Tuck	post_6241319
post_6329797	Nov 07, 2010	724066	None	None	Hi, I am a caregiver for my 50 yr old sister, she was brain damaged at birth.    I know how you can feel at your wits end!    My sister is about mentally 5 yrs old, talks and laughs to herself.    My brother is now back in town and he is cocaregiver, but he only gets her dinner and takes her on rides.    There is a group here that gives respite care for 2-4 hours during the week.    I truly value that time.    Is there a social service in your town that offers services like this?    I'm here.	post_6241319
post_6295697	Oct 27, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello V,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am not an expert but I have some concerns about your post.The normal range for blood sodium levels in the USA is 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). His sodium is not significantly low.No one should be drinking salt in there water. This is VERY dangerous given his history of CHF. This will cause fluid to build up in his tissues, including those around his heart and lings. Unless this has been prescribed by a physician please stop this practice immediately!!!He is probably being prescribed a diuretic which will decrease his potassium and sodium levels. K+ replacements can bring up these levels. Please talk to his PCP or seek another opinion. My heart goes out to both of you.Best of Luck to You and your Dad.Please Take Care,~Tuck	post_6272747
post_6298120	Oct 28, 2010	1310148	547368	Tuckamore	thanks, thanks for your opinion and concern for question. tuck he is not taking any diuratic medicine.	post_6272747
post_6295549	Oct 27, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Bud,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. Please accept my sincere apology for being to tardy in my response.How is your father now? These "flu like" attacks should not be dismissed. Has he been seen by his PCP or taken to ER? I am wondering if these are TIA (transient ischemic attack).A (TIA) is often labeled â  mini-stroke,â   it is more accurately characterized as a â  warning stroke,â   a warning you should take very seriously. This occurs when small clots pass through the brain and they symptoms are transient. They can precede a CVA (cerebrovascular accident) better known as a stroke. Some ppl can have TIAs for years and never experience a CVA. Other ppl have several TIAs and then experience a CVA. So please don't dismiss his symptoms.I am far from am expert and he may not be having TIA episodes. But at 88 please don't take the chance. I hope you will let us know how he is doing. I will look forward to your updates with interest.Take Care,~Tuck	post_6261824
post_6028508	Aug 14, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello NCteacher,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am so glad that you found us and took the time to post. I am very sorry to hear about your mom's urinary incontinence issues. It's embarrassing when this occurs no matter what the age.You may be right that the mere exertion it takes for your mom to get to the bathroom is more than she can tolerate. However it may very well be that no matter how quickly she could get to the bathroom it would do no good. She may be incontinent either way. I am guessing that she has POP, or Pelvic organ prolapse. There are both non-surgical and surgical treatments that can be utilized to control, improve, or repair this condition.In stage 4 COPD your mom is not a candidate for a surgical repair. Imagine if you will if the tables were turned how very embarrassing this extremely personal issue would be for you. Your mom no more wants to have a bladder control issue than you do. She really isn't all that elderly, though her health may make her older than her years.A urogynecologist may be able to evaluate your moms condition better IF her PCP beleives this would be an option. This is an obstetrician/gynecologist (Ob/Gyn) or urologist who specializes in the care of women with POP or pelvic floor dysfunction.We also have a forum that is more directed at this condition that may provide you with more information.    Here is the link:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Urogynecology/Taking-Pelvic-Organ-Prolapse-Out-of-the-Closet/show/1271553Lastly this may a situation that will just have to manage. I'm sure you would never shame your mom for this medical issues. She probably just has no control. Her stage 4 disease takes much from her. Struggling for breath is absolutely exhausting. The time that she has remaining should be a time of reflection and peace. She should be as comfortable as possible.In my state she would be eligible for the caring, supportive and kindness help of Hospice. Stage 4 is considered an end stage lung disease. My dad passed 13 weeks ago with that very DX. Hospice was not here to help him die but to help him live. If you have not looked into into this valuable no cost service I encourage you to do so.    They can make the difference.Your last questions was if it is uncommon that seniors not even be aware that they have had an accident. In your mother's case that may well be the case.My heart goes out to you. I wish you both the very best. Support your mom as much as you are able. Let her know how much you love her and hug her when you can. Don't forget the big picture. In the scheme of things "accidents" aren't so important.I'll be thinking of you and your mom.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6028216
post_6029472	Aug 15, 2010	1300526	1390966	NCteacher	Nice answer Tuck, Just to add to this in case it might help, My mom had a problem and she was not so embarrased and she did manage to get results, She went to a urologist and he gave her a cream that goes right at the entrance of the vagina and it works its way up to help an infection on the plevic floor area that turned out to be her problem and also told her about an exercise she can do to help and this worked for her, Might be hard to convince your mom to do all of this but if she will it is worth a try. The exersize is described on the web if you look it up and may also be in the forum Tuck mentions. It is easy to do but might be hard to talk to your mom about. I hope all goes well and nice to see that you care so much to help your mom. Take care..	post_6028216
post_6029986	Aug 15, 2010	547368	None	None	Thanks Sallysmart for your wise input. You are correct regarding exercises and creams that my be beneficial.    The fact that her COPD is so advanced may make the normally ordered Kegel exercises very difficult for her. However it certainly is worth looking into.In rereading by response I noted that I mistakenly said that at stage 4 COPD you mom "is not" a candidate for surgical repair. I did not word that correctly and I apologize. I cannot make a determine what treatments may or may not be available for you mom. Her physician is the one to make that assessment.What I do know from experience is that her disease condition zaps ones energy and makes any invasive procedures less of an option.Again I wish you both the best and hope to hear from you soon.Take Care,~Tuck	post_6028216
post_6031375	Aug 15, 2010	1390966	None	None	Thanks to the both of you for your support and answers.    My sister and I love our mom dearly and would do anything for her.    It's just going to be difficult for her to discuss this because it's so embarrassing for her.    I have told her in the past that aren't upset about her incontinence, but that we need her to help us work with her by being honest and upfront with issues she faces.She lives with my sister (I live in a different town), and, while we have avoided the idea of hospice or in-home care, my mom's needs are quickly growing.I will take your ideas to my sister, and we'll have a conversation with my mom.    Tuck, I appreciate you correcting yourself that only her doctor could determine her surgical candidacy, but you're absolutely right.    She is no shape for any sort of surgery, and they've already rejected any type of surgery on her bladder.This is a very difficult time for us.    She seems to be getting older and weaker daily, and we wonder how much time she has left.Anyways, thanks for your input!    It's much appreciated.	post_6028216
post_6031827	Aug 16, 2010	547368	None	None	I have been exactly where you are. I KNOW the pain your heart is feeling. I do know how very difficult this time is for you and your sister. My heart aches for you both.I took care of daddy in our home. He lived with us for almost eight years. He survived 18 months after his DX of end stage lung disease. My sister lives in another state and was unable to actively participate in his daily care...but she was great support. She called almost every day in the last 6-8 months. She sent dad what we called "Care Packages." These small boxes that came very several weeks were filled with candy, writing paper, stamps, snacks, trinkets and so on. He used very little of it but LOVED to get those packages. He couldn't wait to open them.Your sister and Mom will need to same from you as I am sure you know. The unexpected phone calls or visits just to say "I Love You" will mean so much to both of them.Hospice is not at all what I had thought it was...their role has greatly changed from what it was 20 years ago. They were so supportive and instrumental in dad's "living."    The last journey would have been MUCH more difficult without them.Please come visit us when you feel the need. The nights can get long, lonely and painful. Watching my dad slowly deteriorate was the hardest thing I ever did. Truly! MedHelp was another source of support. Use all tools available to you. You'll need them.My heart goes out to you!Blessings,~Tuck	post_6028216
post_6258532	Oct 17, 2010	1390966	None	None	I wanted to provide a quick update and to express my thanks for all of the support.    Mom unexpectedly passed away a couple of weeks ago.    Apparently, her emphysema had taken a toll on her heart, and she went into cardiac arrest.    She had not had a recent exacerbation and had not be hospitalized in over a year.    We are deeply saddened but glad that she did not continue to deteriorate with the COPD.    I appreciate the kind responses I received on this forum and other MedHelp forums.	post_6028216
post_6257821	Oct 17, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Cmgriffen,I am sorry to hear about your clients dermatology problem. I am far from an expert. In my experience this does not sound a reaction to the flu vac. Could it be coincidental that this seems to correspond to the vaccination?By all means she should have a medical consult. At the very least this must be extremely uncomfortable for her. Regardless of the causation she needs her symptoms treated.Please let us know what your find out. I would be interested to her her physicians opinionBest of luck to you and her.Take Care,~Tuck	post_6255798
post_6201209	Oct 01, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Sweetie,My heart goes out to you. I am so very sorry you have so much on your plate. Bless you for giving so much of yourself to your Mum.I can imagine how you feel. I dreaded the possibility that my dearest father would become more care than I could handle. I was blessed to be able to care for him until the Lord called him Home four months ago.I am sorry that I do not know the laws in your country. I'm sure ours in the USA are a bit different. We cannot put up side-rails on both sides of a bed because it is considered restraints by law...... That is unless the patient would request those side-rails up. Crazy huh? We have soft mats that are placed by the bed in case someone fall out of it. We also have bed alarms that alert staff when a patient is attempting to get out of bed.I so wish there were alternatives for caregiving in your home. Have you spoke with the hospital social worker? Is he/she able to offer suggestions other than an extended care facility?If you have no alternatives but to agree to extended care please know that you have done your best. Many daughters or sons would not have cared for their mum as long as you have. You've done your best and I am sure you have done a good job.Certainly if your mum had a voice in this she would not want you to risk your health and sanity to continue to care for her. Sometimes love just isn't enough and we have to allow others to provide the care. Please don't think that you have failed. You have not!!You can visit her often and monitor her care. If the facility does not meet your standards insist that she be moved to another. If they know the family is interested and watching the care of often better. I do know that in our country there are some wonderful long term care facilities. Unfortunately a few give them all a bad name.I do believe and I am sending you peaceful thoughts. I'll also keep you and your mum in my prayers. Please stop by again and let us know how you are doing. You are a sweetheart and I am sure your mum is very proud of you and all you have done for her.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6200763
post_6206246	Oct 02, 2010	465080	547368	Tuckamore	Thank you so much for your kind and loving response.    I am so sorry about your dad and you're very brave to carry on with this project when you probably feel so sad and vulnerable.Time doesn't heal but it helps you to get used to the difference.I know what you're saying is right and I've been down every social work avenue to get more help here. The answer is always no. It would be good to have some cash so we don't have to rely on these people    but that's life.The whole reason I want to look after my mum is that I know she would never let me down and I want to do the same for her. But you're right in that she wouldn't want me to hurt or suffer. So, I'll probably have to go along with the Nursing home.I'll keep in touch and let you know what's going on. Thank you for being there and for being so wonderful.xxx	post_6200763
post_6223368	Oct 07, 2010	547368	None	None	Just wondering how you are doing. I hope you are checking this site from time to time.How's your mum? You've both been in my thoughts and prayers.You're right, losing my father was and continues to be extremely difficult. I have been a caregiver my entire life. I never thought I would also be caring for my parents. We never think that time will come.I tried to impress upon a young friend never to take her parents for granted. I explained that because our parents have always been with us on our journey through life, it is very difficult to think of them as no longer being here. But that time does come. We lose the only unconditional love that we'll ever have on this earth. We lose our best friends.I hope you have found some resolution for your mum's care.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6200763
post_6236766	Oct 11, 2010	465080	547368	Tuckamore	hi! haven't been able to concentrate on anything including pc. thank you for caring. I am still so stressed, even more so now. Went to see mum in hosp on Saturday, she was sitting there soaking wet with her feet ina puddle of wee on the floor. I nearly got thrown out because when i complained the nuirse in charge said they were serving supper and she'd do it later! I insisted that they do it that minute-after which my daughter took me outside to calm down.I haven't been able to eat or sleep all weekend. If that's hospital what on earth will happen in a nursing home?Anyway, sent a very strong complaint to the ward manager who called me today. She was even more fuming than I was! (not there on the weekend). She promised that all staff will be reminded most strongly that all patients must be toileted every 2 hours. Also, to remember that one day their own mothers may be in the same position as the patients.I asked her what she thought about nursing home. (We've known her for some months now with mum in and out of hospital). She said since she first met me, there has been a marked change. I have large bags under my eyes, no colour in my face and look like I've never been to bed! Said I have done my absolute best but any more and I'll end up in the bed next to Mum - and even skinnier!    (Mum is a whole 84lbs)..It's time to admit that mum is too ill and I'm not strong enough - the spirit's so wiling but the body's weak.She made me feel better about everything but it's still such a wrench.And do you know what? My sister told me to throw all Mum's old clothes away. When i told her I couldn't and could she come and help she said sorry, no time. She just doesn't understand, it's like throwing mum away. Apparantly mum has to have all new stuff to go into this nuring home!Do you wonder that I'm stressed?Seeing the social worker on wednesday -minus sister - to see what's happening next and if the NHS will fund the nursing home.Will let you know what happens. Thanks for caring, Tuck. do you know, I've been grieving for about two years now as my mum deteriorates and loses another piece of herself. That's why moving her stuff out and trying to come to terms with her not being here and never returning to sleep in her room is one more loss on the way to the inevitable. It hurts, Tuck, oh, now i'm crying again. It really does feel like grief. I've got to stop this but I just feel so emotional and so sad.    My husband can't bear it either! i thought he'd be a bit relieved but he so wanted her to be with us to the end. Also, being a man, it's something he can't fix or be in charge of. It does make you feel so helpless.Right, this time I'm going to bed, 11.00p.m. in UK. Love and blessings to youx	post_6200763
post_6082761	Aug 29, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Precious,I am glad that you wandered over to our forum. WOW, caregiving is a tough road. And we thought the journey through chronic pain was difficult. Add the two together and it can be a nightmare.Bless you for giving to your parents. As you have learned not many of us can or will do that. You are a brave,kind and loving daughter. I know it is appreciated.If you've done any reading, you know I lost my 81 year old dad after caring for him solely in my home for almost eight years. In the last 18 months of his life I watched him fail every week. My heart was breaking and my pain never leveled out. I do know what you are going through.What I do suggest is that you contact either your local home health agency or Hospice. Your father needs a terminal diagnosis to be eligible for Hospice Care. There is no "time limit" on his life. Some ppl are on Hospice for three years, some for three days. But your dad's physician must state that he is terminal or has some "end stage" disease.Hospice is NOT the agency it was twenty years ago. They are not the "death squad."    I and dad chose Hospice and both of us were very grateful for their support and help. They became family at the time. They also provided me with much needed Respites. You should also be eligible for other types of in home services. Please look into it.None of my siblings chose to help with the care of our dad. My sister lives too far aways to be physically involved and his son has other obligations. So it was me. I am not sorry for one moment. The reward was knowing that I did everything I could have for dad and he was so grateful. But his mind stayed good right up till the end. Had he been confused and required more physical care I don't know if I would have made the same choices. You should feel proud for what you are giving so selflessly to your parents. But do some soul searching as this may be too much for you. It's a very tough job. No one can really understand that until they have been there. ...just like chronic pain.What would your dad want if his mind was sharp? Would he want you to be the sole caregiver and risk your health and induce more pain to keep him at home? My dad would not have wanted that. We had discussed all possibilities before he became terminal. Dad knew that once he was bedridden or confused he would be moved to a long term care facility. It was the only choice that could have been made for his benefit as well as mine. Please think about that possibility. When you have tried all else don't be afraid or ashamed to say you just can't do this anymore.Unfortunately you cannot make your siblings live up to their end of the bargain or make good on heir promises. Mine never promised me support. I knew I was in it alone. However have yo sent them all noted and asked for some help? Sometimes when it is in writing it is more difficult to ignore.God Bless you for all you are doing. Please look into some respite care. I know from experience that we cannot do this completely alone. My heart goes out to you. Just know that no matter what you decide you will NEVER be sorry for the time you gave to your dad. Hug him often. never forget to tell him everyday how much you love him and what a great father he has been. Not only does he need to hear that it will comfort you when he is gone.We are here to support you. Please feel free to post whenever you need to ...responses my be slow but they are never ignored. There are lurkers reading and wishing you well.Don't forget to take care of you...be very good to yourself. You are a jewel.You'll be in my thought and prayers.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6081429
post_6084137	Aug 30, 2010	1140037	547368	Tuckamore	Thank you SO much tuckamore!! Your post has lifted my spirits so much! The hospice care had come for the first 60 days that my dad was home from the nursing home, they said that they could only come for 60 days then "he has to be hospitalized again before they can come back"... we did manage to convince the young man that helped him with his showering twice a week to stay on with us "under the table". So that is one chore that I get a small breathing break away during.I did just find out that there are government programs that will pay us for caring for our parents. I will be calling them tomorrow to find out details. I don't know how my disability will be affected or if it will be affected.I do make sure to give him the love and affection he needs and deserves. He doesn't remember being in the hospital or being in the nursing home at all... but when he was in the nursing home, every time I went to visit he would ask me with tears in his eyes "if I could take care of him at home". It was heartbreaking!! I was a veterinary technician for 12 years prior to my disability. So I have medical experience even though it was with cats, dogs, horses, etc.I make sure that I log every single thing I do, when I do it! I have a daily notebook which I record all his meds, times, his blood sugar twice a day and his shots. It has a section for "questions for doctor" so that when he goes to his appointments we don't forget to ask anything that we may have a question about.I just try to cope every day and night with my pain... which has been getting worse!Thank you for your love and support! You are an angel!! I am thankful you have taken the time to post to me and help me out!!XOXO precious	post_6081429
post_6091824	Aug 31, 2010	547368	None	None	Check the service again. I don't think ti changes from state to state as it is funded by Medicare....but it could.Home Health Care can only be approved for 60 days. Hospice is till the end of need. So PLEASE check on that. Dad had 2 Home Health Approvals, each for sixty days. Hospice Services do not end until they are no longer needed...or unless the patient has recovered completely and is no longer end stage disease. Ppl get these terms mixed up.I am sure you are giving him much love and attention...or you would not even be his caregiver. It rips at our heart. There is no easy way to get through this...but with lots of prayers.Chronic Pain is not conducive to care-giving. It makes everything more difficult. I use to say that I THOUGHT caring for my dad was the hardest thing I ever did...I soon discovered there was no thinking....it WAS the hardest thing I ever did.    But as I have said I have no one moment of regret.You'll make it and you won't have any regrets. Just don't be afraid to say you need a break. That is not failing...that is being human. Hospice told me that I had to take care of me before I could take successfully care of anyone else. The Respites were so helpfulI honestly think your dad should be eligible for Hospice.Hang in there...you are going above and beyond what most children are ever willing to do.Your parents are very fortunate to have your love and dedication. You're in my thoughts and prayers.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6081429

So i am left using my 18 yr. old son's.... which is no easy task! I am lucky to use it during the middle of the night when he is sleeping or on mornings like today when he has no work and was up late so he is sleeping in!I will look into the hospice this week.Thank you for telling me the things I need to hear right now! You are such an asset to the whole medhelp community. I wish they knew how lucky they were to have you here!My sister finally came and gave dad a haricut, which he desperately neeeded!!One step in the right direction! I am hoping to see more of her, although she told me the other day that she was just diagnosed as diabetic! Thats two family members now who have diabetes. Now I have to make sure I go & have that lab work thats been sitting on the table for a couple of weeks!!I know, I know... .I shouldn't neglect my own health. Caring for my two boys is a lot. Thank god they are 18 & 16!    They just started school and we are having issues with College, Financial Aid mistakes my son made, school clothes & supplies... rides here and there, and caring for dad 24/7..., exhausting!.My does the best she can!Thanks Tuck!!

So remember that you are very special.I hope you'll be able to find some assistance in home health care. Please don't put it off. Pick up that phone and make some calls.Actually if I neglected to tell you, your father's physician can order Hospice.

post_6233553	Oct 10, 2010	1452620	1140037	precious_woman	Hi Precious,I just now found your post, so this is a bit late. I hope that your sister will provide a little more help. You must feel truly alone in caring for your parents. Reading about your situation, with siblings who do not participate in the hard job of caregiving, I took a second look at my own Pity Party. I am an on-again off-again yet sole caregiver for my sister, a thousand miles away fighting ovarian cancer. When things get really bad, I go to TX and stay with her anywhere from 3 weeks to 3 months. Our parents are deceased, my two brothers died tragically, she is single with no children, and no in-laws for either of us. If I lose her, my entire family will consist of my two wonderful but single sons who work long hours. Sometimes I don't know if I will survive another loss.My great fear is that I will fail mentally and emotionally (I have Bipolar Disorder II). I go through the "if only" scenarios, especially "if only I had siblings to help". The truth is that if my brothers were still alive, they would not be good candidates for caring for my beautiful sister. It's also true that you cannot change your siblings into concerned caregivers. I've seen your situation take a sharp turn when a mom or dad approaches death. They show up with a lot of drama, and the true caretaker ends up playing host/hostess to them--as if caretaking wasn't enough! I hope you will set and respect your own boundaries as an important part of taking care of yourself.So, I have learned from your discussion with Tuck that obsessing on the "if only" scenarios is a waste of time and energy. For me, if Sis doesn't beat the odds (20% five year survival, and starting her fourth year), the end will involve either my going to TX, or Sis moving far from her home to live with me. I've obsessed about both scenarios, and it's time for me to stop!!Even with siblings, you have become the sole caregiver. It probably hurts more than it would if you had no siblings. Please try to stay healthy, and I know that you have heard this many times--but under the circumstances, you are the only one who can do it.    My thoughts are with you.Sincerely,Pleiad	post_6081429
post_6118648	Sep 08, 2010	547368	None	None	Hi Rosco,You've asked a great question.First I would encourage your father to utilize a cell phone. We purchased one for my father when he was 77 years old. At first he balked at it but with encouragement and teaching he soon became accustomed to it and it never left his side. There are some that are made specifically for seniors....no bells or whistles...just larger print and with operator assistance. The operator assistance is a great feature for elderly users.Secondly it is my belief that the "best" Med Alert Devices varies by location. In our area there is one that is connected to our local and area ER and EMS departments. Our senior citizens have had the best response with this service.I think that the home care service you employ may be best at answering this question. My (divorced) parents were offered different suggestions/services by their individual physicians. So you may also want to check with your fathers PCP also.I applaud you for your concern for your father and his wives care. It is so very important that our elderly have a concerned and caring child involved in their life. I cannot tell you how often the information associated with medical care confused my father. He was an alert and intelligent senior citizen. Indeed as I waded through the often seemingly contradicting    information I found it very challenging....and I am younger and have experience in those areas. I had to double check everything from prescriptions to billings to benefits. So bless you for the active role you are playing in your fathers senior life.From experience I encourage you to check everything and everyone involved in delivering services to your father and his wife.Please share with us your decision on medical alert devices. We all learn from one another.Best of luck to you ...and you father.~Tuck	post_6118159
post_6121355	Sep 09, 2010	956387	547368	Tuckamore	Thank you for responding, and for your encouragement.    My father is in Arizona and I'm in Maryland, so his well being is always on my mind.    He sometimes has to travel to Phoenix (I have no idea how many miles away) and cross the desert in his travels.    His 2 cars are old and he takes great pride in seeing how long he can keep them on the road.I'll look into devices associated with the emergency services in his area, as you suggest.    If anyone in Arizona (in or near Wickenburg) has experience along these lines, I would love to hear about it.Thank you again.	post_6118159

post_6171149	Sep 22, 2010	956387	547368	Tuckamore	Please accept my sincere condolences on the loss of your father.    My thoughts and prayers are with you.I haven't got around to following up on your suggestion to investigate local Wickenburg emergency services.    I've spent considerable time tracking down and talking to offices that provide long-term services suitable for my father's situation.    I made application in his name (at his authorization) to receive a home-care worker who will provide nursing care for the wife as well as prepare meals and do light housework.    As long as there's somebody on hand who can handle an emergency, I feel fairly comfortable that my father and step-mother will not be left to their own devices for long.Thank you again for your interest.	post_6118159

post_6115110	Sep 07, 2010	1434473	None	Hi Susie ;)	I am new here, but I have an ileostomy very simulator to your husbands. Being diabetic always can complicate things, I am sorry to here about his discomfort. I don't know what part of the country you live in? But, I am in TX and its very humid here. First off, I am allergic to the adhesive from the wafer, lol! Argh! So I to, use the Smith & Nephew skin prep wipes and I dry the skin really well before I put a new wafer on. The other problem I have had is I get "skin yeast sores" under the wafer sometimes. After my shower I use blow dryer to dry skin well, (don't get to close to the stoma with the dryer!!) you don't want to burn yourself! When dry I run a tiny bit of Monostat cream all around where the wafer is going to be and I just let it air dry for a few mins. Hold a Kleenex over the stoma in case of leaks :) Then I wipe any oily residue off w/a kleenex and then I use the dryer again to make sure it is completely dry on the skin. Then I wipe the Skin Prep on the skin and allow to dry, I use the dryer for that to. Just hurries things along :) Then I put my paste around the wafer hole and replace my wafer. Yeast is very common on the skin when it can't get air very often. And the sores can really hurt and bleed. If it gets that bad. I take all off and just kick back in my bedroom with a box of wipes and a trash bag and let my skin air out for as many hours as I can. Don't use any creams that are oily as your wafer will not stay on!!! That is why I am so careful to dry, dry and more dry! I can't dx if its staph or not ?? He really needs to see a Ostomy Nurse to be sure of what your dealing with and she can be your guardian angel with any questions. The way you find one is call any GI surgeons office and ask who they use in your area as a Ostomy Nurse and get her number. I hope this helps you!!!! I understand both the caretaker and being the patient. I wish you both the very best. Please, get a hold of that Ostomy Nurse as soon as possible, she can help you with anything you need or questions!!! I will carry you in my thoughts! @}-----}---------------- Bright Blessing to you both!Always~Shelley	post_6001473

post_6028372	Aug 14, 2010	547368	None	None	Anton, THANK YOU so MUCH!Very Sorry Rebecca and sister, I missed your translated post till just now.....and apologize for my tardy response. Please be aware that I am not a physician or an expert. I have a limited medical background. However my mom had a similar surgery and I know how very frightening this an be. My heart goes out to you.I think you are saying that your mom has Aortic Value Stenosis (narrowing). Is this correct?Surgery does a suddenly repair and in most instances the function of the heart improves quite dramatically after surgical valve replacement. But you are more concerned about her recovery, correct?It is a long recovery process, about 6-12 weeks. But totally recovery time can take up to 9-12 months. The healthier she is the quicker the recovery.    She will probably be told not to do any lifting for many months. She may be more tired until she recovers. However she may feel much better once her heart is functioning normally.After surgery your mom will probably be prescribed antibiotics and a blood thinner. They will watch her close for infection. If they use a mechanical value she may very well have to take blood thinners for the rest of her life.The risk of death or serious complications from this surgery is typically quoted as being between 1-3%, depending on the health and age of the patient, as well as the skill of the surgeon.According to statics the risk of death or serious complications from aortic valve replacement is typically between 1-3%. Again this depend on health and age of the patient and of course the skill of the surgeon. In my opinion it is important that the surgeon be very skilled and have lots of experience in valve aortic replacements.When this surgery is done by a skilled surgeon it is usually very safe...but any surgery regarding the heart is serious. I cannot tell you how much I feel for you both. I know the fear that we feel when our parents are ill or facing a serious surgery.I will keep you and your mom in my thought and prayers. Please let us know how she is doing. She will need your assistance, love and support and I am sure you will both be there for her.    I'll look forward to hearing from you again.Blessings,~Tuck	post_5996431

post_6022323	Aug 13, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello and Welcome to the Caregivers Forum.This is the correct place for your post. I apologize for my tardy response. I was off caring for an injured husband and did not get to the Forum until now.It is a fact that a CVA (cerebral vascular accident) (stroke) can cause changes in one's personality.I think that is part of what you are seeing.Your mom is a nurse and is probably very aware of this fact. It's very difficult when you are trying to nurse a loved one...we are often too close to the situation to see it with clarity.Though you keep repeating you are only a child, you sound very mature and understanding of the situation. No "child" should have the worries that you are expressing. It sounds like you love your father very much. I am so sorry that you have to see his non-compliance and denial. Again this too can be the result of the CVA, at least in part.You talk about having your father live with retired brothers and sisters. Does this mean that you and your mother no longer want him in the home? Or does this mean you are looking fro daycare for him?You've asked a very good question. You really can't make someone that is legally incompetent take medications or do something against their will. We all have "rights" regardless or if we act in our own best interest or not.Many ppl are married and divorced with children from a precious marriage and they are not "depressed all their lives." I suspect that your father's depression goes deeper than a former divorce, especially given the other behaviors that you report.I cannot guess what may have triggered his CVA but I doubt that the pizza actually caused it. I would guess he had a clot or uncontrolled high blood pressure that was at the root of his CVA.Have you tried having you dad put his meds in daily dosing containers? This may help him remember what he has or hasn't taken. You can purchase containers that have to be set up only once a week. Maybe you and your mom could help him with this. But suggesting and not ordering him to to track his meds may be more beneficial.My dear I wish I had a good answer for you. I do know that being a caregiver can be the most difficult task you will ever encounter. If you dad refused to follow his physicians orders, eat correctly or take his medications, sadly there is really nothing you can do to help him. However you can help yourself. Don't feel guilty for his behavior. It is not our fault. Do talk to your mom about getting some counseling to help you deal with his behavior and the pain that it is obviously causing you. In my opinion it is okay to kindly tell your father how he is affecting you...but again please discuss this with your mom.Understand that you dad still needs your love and respect. You may be able to reach him once you are able to deal with the situation and have the tools to do so. He is very fortunate to have your love and concern. Let him know everyday how much you care. You will never be sorry.Please let us know how you are doing and what solutions you may find. You are in a very difficult position and my heart goes out to you and your mom. Don't forget to take care of you too. I'll look forward to hearing from you again soon.Take Care,~Tuck	post_6013188
post_6357893	Nov 15, 2010	1458369	None	ma004700	Hi there. Treatment of early dementia or mild cognitive impairment includes the person to remain physically, socially, and mentally active. This helps maintain healthy weight, promotes relaxation and sleep and improves the mood. A daily walk and socially interaction helps prevent depression.Acetylcholine is an important messenger in brain and is impaired in MCI. Cholinesterase inhibitors stop the breakdown of this neurotransmitter to increase the acetylcholine in the brain and improve brain function in MCI. These improve cognitive functions and slow the conversion of MCI to dementia. Some of these drugs are donepezil,rivastigmine and galantamine.Take care.	post_6357072
post_5960341	Jul 27, 2010	657231	None	None	I think you need to talk to the doctor and understand that dementia is not just a disease that effects the mind, but degenerates the entire body, which is why a diagnosis of dementia is, sadly, terminal.The medications are meant to relieve symptoms and to help her and one appears to be for diabetes. If you take her off that, she could die sooner.The unhappy and afraid is, sadly, simply the disease. My MIL had it and she was also afraid and unhappy.If you do some research, you will see that there are stages to the disease of which people progress. The progression is imperfect - people tend to be in several stages in real life but you see that she will steadily lose more function.I suggest you get more help, more counseling, and prepare.	post_5959764
post_6146683	Sep 16, 2010	1446412	None	Waterdancer	Dear Waterdancer,How very sad that nobody has taken the time to care about sending you an answer to such a question as yours at such an importtant time, while you are still pregnant.First of all, congratulations.I am a mom of a child with a rare chromosome disorder.    And I can tell you that you are receiving a very great blessing. Though you may not realize that now.I can also tell you that this is not the best website to get your information from.    Not the type of information that you are looking for.First of all, you should have asked your geneticist or your genetics councelor.If your child's rearrangement is RARE then you will have a difficult time finding information.    Maybe even finding another child like yours in the world.The field of genetics is making imense strides in the past few years.    Many of the older parents gave up looking for diagnoses when none could be found for their children with the old genetic tests. That is one reason that you will not find a lot of older diagnosed individuals with some rearrangements.    But rather, only those younger children who are newly getting diagnosed now.    It does NOT mean that they are not out there somewhere in the world.Finally, if you are looking for the best website for a rare chromosome disorder,go to www.rarechromo.org and email them and ask away.    That is the best website for your needs. They will email you back and help you with your pregnancy questions.    That is where you might find other children like your baby IF such chldren exist.If I can help you any further feel free to email me.God blessCead	post_6114918
post_6160714	Sep 20, 2010	1227139	1438466	waterdancer	Hello Waterdancer,My name is Sandi and I am the community leader for this forum and two others.    I have to apologize in not getting to your question sooner, I have been in hospital but I do know that your question is very important.    One thing I can share with you is knowing how concerned and stressful this is right now for you and your family.    I have a son who was prenatally diagnosed with Trisomy 21, (Down syndrome) and as a result I have made it a point to provide the support for mom's and families who are receiving prenatal diagnoses.    I have been appointed a genetics guide by the genetics department in the hospital in Toronto Canada.    I am also a facilitator (creator) of a group called Play to Learn through the YMCA for Children with special needs and their families in order to provide support and direction.    I hope that I can provide you with the same support and guidance you may be looking for right now.Congratulations on your pregnancy.    While I know that your amnio results are concerning, I want you to know that your pregnancy is important!I am grateful that Cead has provided you with suggestion for you to review, but in defence of MedHelp and it's many communities (including Expert Doctor Forums) I will say that MedHelp is a wonderful site to find support from others who may be able to point you in the right direction.    While Cead may be correct that you will not find the specific Medical information that you are looking for directly form a community forum, Cead has inadvertently proven herself incorrect by being useful to you!    So, I hope that you will not discount the information that people can give you here in this forum.    I will however stress that this is not a replacement for your own medical advice.There are a number of resources that I can provide to you specifically regarding balanced transolcations.    You may have come accros these in your own reserach.Some are:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocationhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/balancedtranslocationhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=translocationBut indeed, the translocation that you have mentioned is definitely rare in medical literature.    I would definitely advise you to seek a genetics counsellor, (and if you have had the Amniocentesis, you likely do have contact with a genetics specialist).I invite you to contact me directly, as I have many references and support information that I can pass onto you.    I currently am in the process of publishing my own website to help provide resources and support for genetics diagnosis.    Without knowing your intentions to carry out your pregnancy (which I will tell you is a very personal choice, and NO ONE should comment either way toward you on your choice) I hope that you will contact me so that I can give you the support you might be looking for.    I have been in your shoes, as have many mom's here on MedHelp.    Many can appreciate the position you are in, and also the concern and stress that you are feeling.    Your question about whether your child will be "typical" is hard to answer, and I will be the first one to say, that even when there is literature that discusses to potential for your child to have developmental delays, with the strides and steps in the last 5-10 years, so many things have changed.    My son who if you read the medical literature provided by doctors and text suggest that he would not be able to learn or would be "retarded" - a term that is now no longer used today and is a very negative connotation.    Because of the services provided and the help and love from his family, my son is "typical" and meeting all his milestones.    So, from a reality perspective, I want to be able to share much of this and what can be done regardless of a diagnosis.    This is why I strive to create the services and resources that are out there, so that families receiving prenatal diagnosis can see that in reality - the out come is not necessarily the same as what the medical literature says.Please contact me directly, I would love to share and provide you with information that I have and otherwise you might not have been able to find.    I hope also you can tell me if you have learned anything else since you last posted your message.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6114918
post_6186640	Sep 27, 2010	1438466	None	None	Thank you to Sandi and Cead for your responses.My husband and I finally had our meeting with the genetics counselor and a medical geneticist. Unfortunately, as we expected, they were really not able to tell us very much. We have found out that neither of us have the translocation, so no reassurance there. We decided to decline the microarray, since even if it can tell us whether or not there are microdeletions, the docs still are unlikely to know what that will mean for our baby. They did pass us one published study in which 6% of balanced translocations had resulted in some serious congenital problem. So we are trying to hang on to the idea that the other 94% had no obvious problems.Unfortunately it seems the ability to test is way beyond the ability to know what it means. We wish we had not received this information as it is too uncertain to be of any use. Now we will just be working on putting this piece of information aside and moving on. We need to be able to believe our baby will be healthy and cross the bridge later if she is not.Thanks.	post_6114918
post_6189506	Sep 28, 2010	1227139	1438466	waterdancer	Dear Waterdancer,I completely empathize with you and your husband.    While science is making much progress, the fact remains that there is much that is unexplainable until birth and even then there is much that is still not yet understood.I have learned that statistics and numbers are only that but there is comfort in knowing that the greater percentage is definitely in your favour.    (But to show the reality of statistics I was the 1:385 in my maternal odds for Down syndrome).     I wanted to share some information that I just posted to another Mom who has a 3 month old with an Unbalanced Translocation.    I do not have much personal experience with translocations but I thought that it might help.Now keeping in mind that you discovered that neither of you have a translocation, (and that your baby does have a "balanced" translocation, I found this excerpt from a wonderful genetics site I often pass along:- If a child has the same balanced chromosomal translocation in their cells as their parent, the child is unlikely to be affected by the chromosomal rearrangement- Chromosomal changes may be inherited from a parent. More commonly, chromosomal changes occur when the egg or sperm cells are forming or during or soon after the baby's conception: these occur for unknown reasons (spontaneous occurrence).- Reciprocal translocations are nearly always spontaneous, ie. they occur during the formation of the egg or sperm or during or shortly after conception. Therefore neither parent has the chromosomal change. In some cases, however, one parent may have a balanced reciprocal translocation themselves that causes no problems for themselves but may cause problems in pregnancy or with the baby's chromosomal make-up.- The individual with a 'balanced' reciprocal translocation will usually have the correct amount of genetic information for normal development simply rearranged differently from the usual.- Depending on the information contained in the additional chromosome material, the child may have a range of problems or not be affected at all- The nature of these consequences depends on the particular chromosomes involved and the size of the translocated materialThese are points that I obtained from the entire fact page on Genetics site which I find very informative.    You can read the entire fact sheet here:    http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs7.asp#para_5    and perhaps take some time to review the entire site.Again, please let me know if I can be of any other assistance or even just to chat.    I do know that one thing I am grateful for are the friendships I have made during this genetic journey!    Please message me directly at any time.AND - on your ending note, you are right - if anything does become a factor with your baby's development or health, you will manage because of your care and desire to get the best information.    It is the one thing that I feel and know is the reason why our son is doing as well as he is, daily.    If you have the time (sometime down the road), take a look at my blog.    I know your baby doesn't have Ds but for parents who worry about developmental issues, they can take a look to see what Early Interventions and just plain old fashioned love do for our son.    I think what you as parents do, helps to make all the difference.    There are so many therapies and developmental tools out there to assist you should your child need help with meeting milestones or help with development.    http://welcometoourhouse-myjournal.blogspot.comIn addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6114918
post_6474718	Dec 21, 2010	1540720	1438466	waterdancer	BT's re the most common genetic ailment we've never heard of! When I was told my son had one I thought it must be a one in a million condition, and was surprised to hear it's more like 1 in 500 or 600. I guess it doesn't get much press because nearly everyone who has one is virtually symptom-free.I think you have the right attitude to forget about this for now and expect everything to be fine. A 94% chance of having no symptoms? Those are great odds, WAY in your favour.I know you have declined the microarray but you might find it useful as if you are told there are no microdeletions you'll have even more reason to relax and be reassured.My son has a ne novo balanced translocation (completely different chromosomes from your baby) and unfortunately he seems to be in the 6% group. I noticed problems very early (3-4 months of age). He's been accepted into a study on balanced translocations which should shed some light. Here was where I found out about it in case you are interested: http://www.chromodisorder.org/CDO/Resources/LatestResearch.aspx	post_6114918

My apologies, I wasn't reading this board anymore.We had a baby girl nearly 2 years ago and she has been amazing. Knock on wood, she hasn't had any health problems, has been high percentile height and weight, very bright, and is talking up a storm. She is full of energy and keeps us running!So we've decided this translocation maybe causes exceptional sweetness or language abilities or athleticism. :^)    Who knows....Thanks for your support and will update if anything changes.	post_6114918
post_6018543	Aug 12, 2010	1227139	None	Miahlill2i	Hello Miahlilsi,Welcome!    I read your post, and I am glad you found us here.    You might also want to visit my other group Children - Special Needs, simply if you are interested in getting some ideas on how to communicate with your daughter!    I would suggest signing, since my son and his peers with Down sydnrome do use signing extremely well to communicate because many young children with Down syndrome (Ds) also have speech delays.    And the signing has been a wonderful and very well tolerated method for communication.    It's a very rewarding and often fun way to get to communicate well with one another.    I know how frustrated mom's feel when they can't communicate with their children the way the would love to.In talking about the 16th chromosome, have you researched any groups near you that are or have parents/children with other chromosomal abnormalities?    The reason I ask is that as you are looking here to see if any have also had or discovered a similar 16th chromosome issue, you may more likely find them in those play groups!    I know in the parent/child group I created here locally were I live, there are lots of moms who have children with all kinds of rare chromosomal issues!    While my sons Ds is typical (21st chromosome) it is interesting to me how many other genetically enhanced (as I love to call our kiddos) kids are out there, and what types!Now, I guess in order for me to completely understand your daughters karyotype, you mentioned a 16th chromosome duplication.    Is it a complete pair duplication?    Is it just one part of the chromosome that is duplicated - long arm or short arm?    There are so many possibilities, and the situation your daughter has is what might have made it rare, according to your geneticist.    I wanted to say, (and this is only from experience) I have found that when mom's are told that it is rare, the truth of the matter is, it's rare for that doctor or geneticist, but not in the population.    Did they specify how rare, in the percentage or in the statistic?    I would be interested to know that too.Something that I found for you, (which you may have seen already) is from a site I generally pass on to people who want information on genetic situations:    "Duplication of the same 600 kb segment of chromosome 16 that is missing in 16p11.2 deletion syndrome may result in similar symptoms as the deletion in some individuals. People with this duplication may have developmental problems including autism spectrum disorder, language delay, and learning disability. The duplication appears to have a milder effect than the deletion, with a higher proportion of individuals with this chromosomal change showing no apparent disability. These individuals can still pass along the duplication to their children, who may have symptoms of this condition."    This site is :    http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/16This site is rather comprehensive in all genetic material and I find it so very useful in case you are interested.The thing I do know is that Chromosome 16 has a lot of common abnormalities (if we can call abnormalities common) which are usually deletions, which is why your doctor may have suggested that what your daughter has is rare.    One thing additionally I am curious about is do you or have you had her karyotype done to determine if she has the mosaic form of this syndrome?    (Mosaic being that it doesn't' affect all cells as the majority of chromosome issues do since it is at the gene level, which affects all cells of the body and all organs subsequently, unless mosaic.)I do hope, if even you don't discover other mom's or people out here in MedHelp that have similar concerns that you are able to make some connections to help her or assist you and your daughter in the communications department!    Which made me also think to ask you, is she entered into any developmental programs?    Being in the USA (I am Canada), you are entitled to Early Intervention programs which are free for you and your daughter from birth to usually school age or 6 years old, where they will help you with such things as development, (physical or comunication) and this would be extremely beneficial for you and the whole family!    And the best thing is, it's free, and she certainly qualifies.    I do not know if you ahve been told about this yet, or how long you have had the diagnosis, but the programs are so wonderful, and they are what is responsible for my son developing at a typical or above typical rate with all his milestones.    I completely have EI (early intervention) to thank, along with my son's determination, and I guess mine too.I hope that if this is all new to you, I can help to guide you, (I am a parent guide here locally for diagnosis dealing with genetics, by our hospitals genetics department).    Please do message me if I can be of any assistance to help provide you information or maybe guide you in any direction should you need it.    If not, I will presume you already have this information, or are getting the appropriate support from your local departments.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6016879

Both me and her father had a test and the results came back today saying he has the exact same abnormality that she has. Now this is a shock as he doesn't have the problems mentioned above, although he is a bit odd, loud and flat footed.

She would babble but nothing made sense. She was taught simple Makaton ( a form of sign language) but because of her dyspraxcia even this method of communication was not totally successful. She was SO frustrated and obviously her behavioural problems were intensified. Only in the last year or so has her speech become easier for others ( mainly teachers) to understand, and now her sentences have become more descriptive. We take one day at a time and there is progress in all areas although slow.	post_6016879
post_7873008	Apr 18, 2012	2118921	None	None	Hello, I have a 27 year old daughter who was diagnosed as having a "tag" on her 16th chromosome, when I was 6 months pregnant they performed an amnio. I asked what this meant, they said they didn't have any case studies to reference, so it has been a wait and see game her entire life. Back then we didn't have the internet or anything, and the geneticists followed her progress until she was about 13 years old, but I still never received any answers, it was always, wait and see, wait and see. She is non-verbal, which has been one of the most difficult things because she does have many other issues and it is difficult for her to communicate where it hurts, etc. According the the specialists, after testing her dad, me and her brother, this was just a "fluke", as it doesn't come from either side of the family. She has neither an extra chromosome, or is missing any other chromosome, there is simply a "tag" on the 16th, but it doesn't come from anywhere else.I was just wondering if anyone else had ever heard of this, or would have more information for me to research?Thank you in advance.	post_6016879

We have asked the doctors what might be her outcome in life and no one can tell us. I was told that itâ  s a rare chromosome. I have tried looking out on the website for answers and have found nothing on the chromosome.    We notice that she wasnâ  t reaching her milestones and just thought she was taking her time. It was when she turned 1 that we realized that something was wrong. She wasnâ  t sitting, crawling or trying to walk on her own. She is almost 2 and we just got her to sit for 6 minutes without any support. The doctors say that she has low muscle tone. But sheâ  ll fight me when I put her in a sitting position. It seems like she progressing, but at a very slow rate. Iâ  m just trying to find out if anyone else out there has heard of this or is going through the same thing I am.	post_6016879

post_6335737	Nov 08, 2010	419309	1500760	JaimeLynn522	Nuchal fold measurements are not diagnostic, and an increased nuchal measurement is not conclusive for determining whether there is something 'wrong' or not with baby.    The 'normal range' for nuchal is an expected measurement of 3mm or less, but just because a baby has a larger measurement does not necessarily mean something is wrong.There is an association with increased nuchal measurements and a higher incidence of heart defects, Down syndrome, and other conditions, but just because your baby has an increased nuchal does NOT necessarily mean there will be problems.    Many babies with increased nuchal early in first trimester have no apparent problems at delivery or in later development.Did your OB do blood testing (screening) along with measuring nuchal translucency?    Has your doctor recommended you to genetic counseling?    If you have a high level of concern about conditions associated with increased nuchal measurement, your doctor may offer you the option to have other testing (i.e. chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis) to determine whether or not baby has a chromosomal abnormality; your doctor may also recommend that you have a fetal-echocardiogram (an ultrasound to look at baby's heart) in the second trimester to make sure baby has appropriate cardiac development. Hope that helps, and best of luck. ~eureka	post_6335238
post_6396856	Nov 27, 2010	1227139	1500760	JaimeLynn522	Hello JaimeLynn522,One thing to add which is very important when dealing with NT measurements is every location world wide has different ranges for what is considered normal or under before it is considered a risk.    So, please note when you ask outside of here or a doctor for example friends or family, who might be quick to say that 3.0 mm is high or not, an example is in Canada (Ontario specifically) 3.5 is our high end of the normal range.Eureka is quite right when she says that it is not a diagnostic tool and is only used often as an indicator as to whether further screening or testing should be considered.    NT measurements by themselves are not even to be considered problematic unless correlated with other tests such as the high level IPS (integrated Prenatal Screening) Ultrasound.    In the absence of other tests, the NT scan measurement should not be used singularly to determine risk.    Another example on the other side of the coin is, a normal NT reading is also not indicative of a typical baby either.    (This example is true for many and for my first son who had a normal measurement and blood screen yet had Down syndrome.)NT measurements and other screening test do help doctors assess whether there is an increased risk for Down syndrome, (and other Trisomy's), Spina Bifida as well as other health concerns.    Also, NT measurements can not be obtained after 14 weeks gestation since the Nuchal Fold (liquid and fold in the back of the neck) will dissipate fully after that time frame.    So if you are wondering if future NT measurements can be taken after this period of time, the answer would be no, not for screening.The best time frame to have an NT measurement taken is anywhere from 11 to 14 weeks with 12.5 weeks being the most effective timing.    Also, there are things that you can consider also with measurements.    One, each technician can have minute measuring differences (which a formula is used to combat that issue), timing of the gestational age can also be inaccurate, (not often but can be an issue if dating is not really known) and again having mentioned before - world wide the median measurement is different state to state, area to area, country to country.    So there are a lot of factors that go into NT measurements and for this reason alone, I try to explain to mom's not to put too much stake into the measurement on it's own.    If you are worried, you should ask your OB or doctor to refer you to a genetic clinic, or for further testing.    But please remember, screening is only a method to determine the odds and if further testing should be done.    The only way to absolutely know if there are any chromosomal issues (of the most common issues anyway) is to have definitive testing performed which are, Amniocentesis (not done earlier then 16 weeks) CVS (not done before 9 weeks) or PUBS.    These are invasive tests which will test the cells and allow a chromosome analysis to be done.    Note though, these tests only search for the common more likely chromosomal abnormalities and can not rule out other less common or rare issues.I know first hand how stressful and worrying this is, especially when you want for your child to be healthy and fine.    I do happen to have a list of markers for the common chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome, Trisomy 13 & 18 if you wish to have it.    While it is useful to know for when you have your 18-20 week ultrasound or high level ultrasound, note that it is possible for a baby without any chromosomal problems to have markers too.    Please message me directly if you wish me to send it to you.    If you have any other questions about prenatal testing, please let me know.If you find that you need more extensive help with chromosomal questions again, please do not hesitate to ask.    There are a few of us here who have very good information that can be very helpful in that area.

post_6160468	Sep 19, 2010	1227139	1448766	nana770	Hello Nana770,If your children were accurately diagnosed (by blood testing) that they only have one copy of the gene, (heterozygous    as opposed to homozygous meaning having both copies of the genes) then they will only be affected in a minor way and not have the full disease.    In order to have the full Thalassemia they would have had to have (carry) both genes.    If they have been diagnosed as Beta Thal minor, it means they only have one gene.Here is a great site that explains it in more depth:    http://www.medicinenet.com/beta_thalassemia/article.htmHaving Beta Thal minor doesn't mean that they will not have any difficulties or are without problems.    But, the degree of severity is often less.    In your children's case, they might have (at most) mild anaemia.    Often they will only be monitored by a physician to ensure that they do not have iron deficiencies.    Apparently from what I have learned there is no treatment regimen for those who have Beta Thal minor.    But I would absolutely verify this with your own doctors.I hope this is helpful for you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6151653

post_6311688	Nov 01, 2010	419309	1489611	concrnedbrother267	The highest percentages of people affected with thalassemias are not of Caucasian descent, but as you pointed out, there have been cases when that happens, though rarely.    Population genetics is not absolute -- it plots the frequency of diseases in certain groups of people, but there is nothing 100% in our understanding of the human gene.    It is infinitely variable, and nothing is impossible.    For the most part, the general medical community only works with "majority" factors and narrows things down from there.    Hopefully a correct diagnosis will help improve your sister's health.I do want to point out that as a rule, thalassemias are a recessive condition.    That means that if your sister had classic b-thalassemia, her daughters would only be carriers unless their father was a carrier of or had thal as well.    Also, it would also be necessarily true that both your sister's parents had to both be carriers of thal, which would be highly unusual if they were both of German descent.    The fact that there are multiple generations affected also brings into question whether what your sister has is actually b-thalassemia or another hemoglobinopathy.    It might be worthwhile for your sister to consult with a geneticist and hematologist to confirm the genetic diagnosis and appropriate treatments.	post_6296930
post_6349141	Nov 12, 2010	1325642	None	concerned brother	Hi!I would like to share my insights since I as well have Thalassemia Minor.    I get the trait from the British side of my family, and when I say Brit, I mean like almost 100% Brit.    I have also had the same problem with doctors being in disbelief about this.    However, since it has been clearly illustrated that I and my mother, grandfather and other distant relatives have this disease, it is not refuted.    I want to let you know however with this disease doctors do make it a point to test blood frequently, to monitor blood count, iron levels, etc.    I get mine checked at least once a year, but usually have it checked every time I go into the doctor no matter what the problem is.The fact that your sister got sick from iron treatments does not surprise me at all, and I would like to share my thoughts with you on this.    Let me begin by stating that it is hard to find relevant information on this and a lot of my information comes from a long family history of the disease and what we have experienced.    Even though Thalassemia is a relative of anemia, iron supplementation can make our situation worse.    How my mother describes it is this:    those with Thalassemia actually have blood that is misshapen, and to the body it looks unhealthy.    (Actually, when my grandfather registered for WWII he was not allowed in combat because doctors at the time believed Thalassemia was a precursor to Leukemia.)    Because your blood does not look or behave the way it should, your body tends to dispose of the blood more.    As you may know your spleen takes the job of cleaning your blood and disposing the blood that is no longer good.    I know personally I tend to get cramps in the area of my spleen because it is overactive.    As a result your body is left with some of the minerals that was in that disposed blood.    This is why your sister got sick with the iron treatments.    Her body was disposing of her blood faster than normal people's would, and therefore had an over accumulation of iron.    This happened to my great uncle, after he was in a car accident they treated him this way and it nearly killed him.    My doctors always notice that I am quite anemic and suggest iron supplements, but it seems most are not educated in the fact that it can be dangerous to us since our body goes through blood so quickly.Some other things that also effect me which she may have problems with are shortness of breath and symptoms similar to hypoglycemia.    When my mother and I exercise, mainly cardio, we lose our breath quickly and experience asthma-like attacks.    I also feel very weak a lot of the time and feel sick if I do not eat on a consistent basis.    Again, more from word of mouth I have learned that our blood also does not absorb or carry oxygen or glucose like healthy blood should causing more health problems.The severity of symptoms most definitely varies from person to person, as I seem to have more and worse symptoms then my mother, and my mother seems to have worse symptoms then my grandfather.    Determining her level of severity and what is best for her is going to take some time.    It is a bit more difficult living with this disease then most resources will portray.    I wish your sister the best of luck and would also suggest that if and when she has children to have them tested right away to avoid all the trouble she has had all these years.    Hope this was of some help in understanding the disease and helping her manage her symptoms.    If she needs more help from a doctor I would suggest seeing a Hematologist rather than a general practitioner, who in my experience have little to no knowledge of what Thalassemia MINOR is all about, they are all educated on the MAJOR form because it is life-threatening.Best wishes	post_6296930
post_6761311	Mar 23, 2011	1636357	1489611	concrnedbrother267	I find this interesting as I am a blue-eyed blonde of Scotch-Irish ancestry with beta thalassemia minor.    Nearly everyone on my father's side of the family has the trait.I've noted that you (and apes1986) are both American (as am I).    Now, I am only speculating, but is it possible that there is someone in your family tree    - of whom you may not be aware - of Mediterranean descent?    I've considered that as a possibility, at least where I am concerned.As for the British Isles, it is a fact that those from Greece, Spain and Portugal settled there.As eureka254 pointed out, multiple generations are affected.    I think it would be difficult to determine that there wasn't someone of Mediterranean descent in your family tree.I just posted a similar question and am curious to see if anyone concurs with my theory.	post_6296930
post_6050747	Aug 20, 2010	1227139	None	None	The 46, XY means 46 typical chromosomes and XY means a male.    The 47, XY +21 means that the baby has an extra chromosome, (the 47) and is male with the extra chromosome being the 21st choromsome; - meaning Down syndrome.The thing is, usually in Karyotyping for Down syndrome, it just says 47 XY +21.    I am not sure why they also put the 46 XY.    Unless the karyotype suggests that the child has Mosaic Down syndrome, meaning not all the cells have the 47 XY +21.    Usually the report would say the form of Down sydnrome was Mosaic though. instead of only using what you gave me in the description.    In Mosaic Down syndrome, not all cells are affected with the extra chromosome.    Some have 46 and some have 47.    I think you need to get complete clarification, but this karyotype that you are giving me does indicate that there are cells that have 47 chromosomes with the extra being the 21st.Did you suspect that your child had a chromosomal abnormality?    I was wondering if you knew that your child had Down syndrome, or the genetisicts thought so, and thus the test was ordered.If you need more clarification regarding the difference between Non-disjunction Trisomy 21 (the regular most common type of Down syndrome) and the Mosaic Form of Down syndrome, please message me directly.Often children who have the Mosaic form, (only 2-3% of all cases of Down syndrome) are less affected by the extra genetic material.    The characteristics often tend to be less noticeable.    There is a dispute with doctors as to whether or not the intellegence aspect is less affected or not.    However, there is much for you to understand if you had no idea about Down syndrome at all.    I have a very comprehensive website that I am putting together as we speak, and I have a current blog that does address the types of Down syndrome etc, at the top of the blog.    You can read about these in my reference section in the Down syndrome Group Forum, here:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Down-syndrome/show/749?camp=msc&personal_page_id=1186587which includes my blog.Please do send me a message if I can help you further.    I am a parent support guide for diagnosis of Down syndrome - appointed by the genetics department in the Rouge Valley Heath System Hospital here in Toronto.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6044593
post_6051364	Aug 20, 2010	419309	1227139	Dragon1973	Sandi, you stated:"Unless the karyotype suggests that the child has Mosaic Down syndrome, meaning not all the cells have the 47 XY +21.    Usually the report would say the form of Down sydnrome was Mosaic though..."Indeed, the 46,XY/47,XY+21 karyotype would represent mosaicism -- just in scientific annotation.    The written interpretation would probably state such, but remember, each laboratory reports results differently, especially in other countries.Best regards as always. ~eureka	post_6044593
post_6052021	Aug 21, 2010	1227139	419309	eureka254	Hi Eureka!Thank you!    I inadvertently miss typed what I wanted to say.    I had meant to type, "Unless the karyotpye is suggesting that the child has Mosaic Ds" because I had originally typed I wasn't sure why the report had both, but I then realized that it was likely because the child was karyoypted as mosaic.    I wanted to let her know that I believed that the description she was asking about meant that the child has the Mosaic type of Down syndrome, and I think I was rushing far to fast to get out what I meant.I did send her a private message indicating the same.    What I wanted to make sure I mentioned to her is that further in the written interpretation/report it should somewhere indicate that Trisomy 21 was found in a Mosaic form, meaning that it was NOT found in all meta-phases, as it would have said if it were only 47, XY +21 such as my son's karyotype reads.Thank you for correcting my typo.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6044593

I do believe though, if I recall right, it was actually the diagnosis Mosaic Trisomy 21 and that is/was how the karyotype is written where she is located - which is why we mentioned & also concluded Mosaic Ds based on that very annotation she provided.Either way, I am very glad others were able to give their input, to help her while she was looking for answers - while awaiting the actual written explanation.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6044593
post_6375051	Nov 19, 2010	419309	1510707	mommab870	My condolences to you and your husband for your loss and the difficult time you went through.    The quandry in cases of trisomy is that it can happen to any woman's pregnancy but no one really knows to who and when, though your doctor has probably given you an accurate estimate of the likelihood of this happening again. Usually, in most cases, having a trisomy pregnancy has no impact on your ability to have other healthy children.The reality, however, is that pregnancy comes with no guarantees, and there's no testing in the world that can guarantee a healthy baby.    There are tests you can do during pregnancy to rule out Trisomy, but no one can tell during a pregnancy whether or not a child will be completely healthy or not.    Statistically, all couples face a 3% risk of having a baby that needs serious medical intervention.    Parenting has its inherent risks and there is always the possibility of pain and loss -- you just have to find within yourself what risks and losses are bearable to you in the process of becoming a family. Hope that helps, and best wishes to you and your husband. ~eureka	post_6369564
post_6396839	Nov 27, 2010	1227139	1510707	mommab870	Along with my condolences, also to add to the above,Depending on locations, risks do change when you have had a previous birth with a chromosomal abnormality.    Here in Canada we have been told two different things by two different geneticists.    One told us that my maternal risk for having another baby with Down syndrome (since our first son was born with Ds) would be what ever the maternal risk is for my age at the time I become pregnant.    (This being if your child's chromosomal abnormality was not due to a translocation and was random.)    Another geneticists told us that my risk for another baby with Ds would be 1% no matter what my age was.    When I asked why this percentage and where it came from, no one could give me an accurate answer and explained that it was derived from statistics.    I was then told that if the next baby did not have any chromosomal issues, that my odds for any further children would be back to regular risks and odds by age.One thing that is important to note (that I have learned from research all during and after my sons birth) is that more then 60% of all cases of miscarriage are due to typical chromosomal abnormalities.    Also, having genetic mutations or variants in either parent will contribute to the potential or higher risk for having a baby with a chromosomal issue.    One thing you can do, if you haven't been offered it already is to have your chromosomes analyzed or karyotyped.    However, doing this will only help to identify if there any issues with either your husbands chromosomes or your own and can help to predict the liklihood or potential to have a child with a chromosomal isssue.    But since Trisomy's 13, 18 and 21 are most often occurring randomly, it wont help to preclude you from those in future as a possibility as Eureka mentioned and also has no baring on your ability to have children without those chromosome arrangements.Having said that, for a person who has had more then one Trisomy birth, chromosomal analysis of the parents should be in order to rule out any translocations or issues with their own chromosomes.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6369564
post_6576643	Jan 24, 2011	1563242	None	None	I am so very sorry for your loss, i understand your fear. I am living it myself. Throughout my research & dealings with genetic counselors: I have never heard or found anything that says there is a link to environment & having a T13/18 child. T13/18 occur at random only.Everything does state that once you do have a child with one of these it does increase your risk, as well as maternal age, of having another. Normal risk is anywhere between 1:1000,3000-6000 depending on who you talk to or what you read: the number increases after having a child with it : then increases again factoring the mothers age at conception. I am 42 and my chances now of recurrence are 1:14, I think thats what I was told. Even at that the chances are pretty good that a recurrence will not occur. A genetic couselor will be able to calculate yours for you specically. Good luck & i wish you peace within your heart & mind.	post_6369564
post_6504586	Jan 02, 2011	188273	1455294	Alishabeth	Our daughter was also diagnosed with a 10q deletion; more specificaly 10q23.3.    She was diagnosed when she was 2 yrs. old and will now be 5 in January.    She has been having Speech, Physical & Occupational Therapy since she was 6 mths. old and recently we have added Behavioral Therapy to this since she's having problems with understanding "right" from "wrong" and the usual things that go along with being 5.    She was diagnosed this summer with Strabismus in both her eyes but refuses to wear the glasses!!    She also has the prominent nose bridge (or lack thereof) but is not small for her age.    She does have a heart defect -    Bicuspid Valve Stenosis & continual respiratory infections and ear problems.    They have said she has a "special mucus" that is thicker than most and that is what drains out of her ears - after 3 sets, so far & probably what causes her respiratory infections to turn into pnemonia(pneumonia)so quickly.    I don't know if your daughter has a partial deletion of a specific band but I haven't had ANY luck so far in finding many others out there with this deletion.    I'd love to discuss more with you about similarities and maybe things we've done to help or what we might have to look forward to, since your daughter is older.	post_6175527

My daughter is 8 and her adrenal glands do not work.    Make sure you take your calcium and    vitamin D for your bones. The thing that stinks is yes you will have to take steroids.    My daughter is 8 and morbidly obese.I have been doing some research (sticking to credible medical info).    If you look up Dr. Wislon and Adrenal Fatigue, he talks about the circadian rythym.    This is also mentioned in my parent's guide to Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.    I have started to give my daughter    (after speaking with her endo)    about giving her doses more in tune with this circadian rythm.    Check it out.    It has done wonders for her fatigue, mental clarity, and she went from 117 to 115 in about 2 weeks since starting this new regimen.    Guess we will see and I will let you know.

post_6396821	Nov 27, 2010	1227139	1513900	jgmadril	Hello Jgmadril,How old is your son?    This is a pretty frequent question in the Ds community (not specifically here on MH but in general) since our kids have very sparse or thin hair to begin with.    I guess that medically your sons physician doesn't have any recommendations?    Or without going a medical route, you could certainly try any homoeopathic or natural remedies available.    I am not well versed in the naturalist area but I do have mom's in a local group I can certainly ask.The first thing that often we don't think of is whether the loss is hereditary or from the Ds.    Either way though, personally the options I can think of are medical, natural or other such as implants.     I don't know if there are any specific treatments that don't apply to hair loss in general or are specific to Ds but I will ask my local group in case there are.Hopefully someone else here in MedHelp might have better options to suggest in the interim for your son.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6380897

I'm so sorry to hear that you've had so much difficulty and loss with your pregnancies.No one can tell you whether or not to pursue trying again -- there's always the possibility of joy or loss -- but I would definitely suggest that you seek consultation with a medical geneticist    who might have useful information about your particular chromosome inversion and what options are available to you for successful pregnancy and childbirth.

post_6280589	Oct 24, 2010	1227139	None	avpandevp	Hello Avpandevp,If your wife Thalassemia Beta minor, she can pass it on to a child.    The odds of passing on any genetic health problem or mutation is dependent on whether the mutation is a dominant gene.    In your wifes case, if it is a dominant mutation she has a 50% chance of passing the mutation on.Here is a site that talks about the genetics and passing on mutations or variants to an offspring.    http://www.ehow.com/about_5576741_history-genetic-diseases.htmlTo learn whether the child has inherited her Beta Thal minor, the options are to have the child tested by blood test after birth.    But if you do not have this condition then they are likely (if they do inherit) to only have one copy of the gene, meaning they too would have the Beta Minor - meaning that they only have one copy of the gene, (heterozygous    as opposed to homozygous meaning having both copies of the genes).    If they end up with Beta Minor, then they will only be affected in a minor way and not have the full disease.    In order to have the full Thalassemia they would have had to have (carry) both genes.    If they have been diagnosed as Beta Thal minor, it means they only have one gene.Here is a great site that explains it in more depth:    http://www.medicinenet.com/beta_thalassemia/article.htmHaving Beta Thal minor doesn't mean that they will not have any difficulties or are without problems.    But, the degree of severity is often less.    In your wife or possibly your children's case, they might have (at most) mild anaemia.    Often they will only be monitored by a physician to ensure that they do not have iron deficiencies.    Apparently from what I have learned there is no treatment regimen for those who have Beta Thal minor.    But I would absolutely verify this with your own doctors.I hope this is helpful for you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6270649
post_6287470	Oct 25, 2010	419309	1481920	avpande	"My wife has detected thalassemia beta minor. We are planning for our child in next few months.    Would like to know is there any chances for our child-to be born get infected by thalassemia when i have normal hemoglobin count."---------------It's very likely that your wife's detection of beta thal minor is recent, during the pregnancy?    I would expect so because most people with beta thal trait do not have any health problems or symptoms from having beta thal minor.    Assessing risk to your child for beta thal or similar condition would require more details than just your hemoglobin count.    Certain blood test results would be needed to determine risk: Mean Corpuscular Volume, A2 Quantification, and possible Iron studies or gene sequencing would need to be done on you to assess risk for your child."And if yes, what are the prcautions shall we take? Also... how shall she be cured from this Beta Thl"------------------There are no 'precautions' one can take to to be 'cured' of beta thal minor or major.    It is not an infection; it is a genetic trait and cannot be changed.    Your wife cannot 'change' having beta thal minor -- she inherited the trait from one of her parents, and all her children will have a 50% chance of inheriting the trait as well.    Fortunately, most people who have beta thal minor have no health concerns related to their status.    Beta thalassemia major occurs when both parents each with a beta-thal trait give their beta-thal gene to a child.    Modern medicine has made it that long-term survival is possible nowadays with beta-thal major, but it is a condition that requires serious medical intervention.    My hope is that you and your wife will not need to be concerned about beta thal major.Best of luck to you, your wife, and the new baby-to-be.    ~eureka	post_6270649
post_6280753	Oct 24, 2010	419309	1024890	Ina_Alex	You stated:"the husband is free of CF at all."    It would be necessary to know exactly what test was used to determine the husband's CF status to accurately assess risk.Some labs test for only 32 mutations; some test for as many as 97, but very few test the whole CF gene sequence, and there are thousands of possible mutations.    Any of these tests would reduce the risk to less than 1%, but how much lower than 1% could only be determined by knowing what kind of CF screening was done on the husband.    A genetic counselor would be able to review the specific risks based on the couple's background and test results.	post_6278971

post_6269513	Oct 20, 2010	363110	1481275	bea9430	First, Congrats on becoming a grandmother even if it's at a young age.Actually it's fairly normal for young women to have higher risks/numbers for down syndrome, although I'm not sure why exactly. I'm Cindie and I was 21 when my son TJ was born with down syndrome.The spot on    the heart is actually very common during pregnancy. it's called an Ecogenic Focus and it is a calcium spot and if it doesn't dissapear by birth it dissapears within the first few years of life. It has no adverse effects on the child.    TJ actually did NOT have a EIF, but had other markers like what I mentioned and at 2 years old is currently about 13 1/2lbs. My 2nd child Mason DID have an EIF and he was healthy when he was born and at 10 months weighs     23+lbsIf your daugher is REALLY worried about down syndrome she can have an amnio but if she wants to keep the baby no matter what, then she should wait until later around a viable age for the child. What's good is these days most cases can be found by ultrasound.What you and your daughter want to pay attention to is if there are 2 or more markers. There can be descrepancies between the stomach/head arms/legs, there can be differences noted on 3D u/s when she's further along.    I found out about my son before he was born around 17 weeks because we were testing for a genetic skin disorder that would affect how he needed to be born.Send Sandi (Dragon1973) a message. She too has a son with down syndrome.Feel free to send either one of us questions you have that I may not have answered here. I think lately I've been on a bit more than she has. I'm a stay at home mom and she's a police officer :) and BOTH of us love our boys more than anything in the world and feel incredibly lucky to have them. Her son didn't really have any serious health issues but my son TJ did have heart problems that were too serious to heal on their own w/meds so he had surgery and a few complications related to DS and the skin disorder that he did indeed test positive for at around 23w.I do not think Hydrocephalis should be a worry with your daughter because it's probable they'd have found hints of it on her ultrasound.ttylCindie	post_6268720
post_6277851	Oct 23, 2010	1227139	1481275	bea9430	Hello Bea9430,Welcome to the Forum and please forgive my absence and tardiness in getting to your question. Cindie explained the answer perfectly.    There are many markers for Down syndrome and if your daughter would like, I can send her a list of known markers and characteristics for Ds.    Her odds or risk assessment of 1:190 is less then 1% overall.    This risk and assessment changes as she continues along in her pregnancy and also as more screening or testing is done with respect to prenatal testing.As Cindie mentioned an EIF or bright spot on the heart is a known marker BUT in the absence of other markers is actually not indicative of anything at all.    Many many babies have EIF's show up on their ultrasounds, and when found alone (with no other known markers) tends to mean absolutely nothing.    I have some really good sites regarding EIFs that she can read here if you would like to pass them on to her,What I would suggest for her upcoming ultrasound is that (and this will likely happen regardless) is that they look for other known markers.    If there are any correlating markers found, then she will likely be offered further testing or screening (testing being more definitive and screening which only gives you odds) as a normal protocol.Depending on her focus if the baby should have Ds, knowing before hand can make learning and preparations easier and the time to adjust a whole lot better.    However, if her desire isn't to continue her pregnancy, then she will have to opt to have an Amniocentesis before 20 weeks.    I invite you both to visit my blog, which is all about Down sydnrome and has a lot of references within it.Here are the sites:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echogenic_intracardiac_focusSo keep in mind in the absence of other markers, An EIF is stand alone marker which will not necessarily increase the risk for Ds.Here is my site:http://welcometoourhouse-myjournal.blogspot.com/Please feel free to message me for the list of known markers at any time.    Please just reference your message so I can recall who you are - I have many requests for information.I wish you well and I hope her pregnancy continues without problems.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6268720

Because each parent contributes 1/2 of the child's genetics, the possibilities are such that:If father gives A gene and mother gives A gene, baby will be AA. (Type A)If father gives A gene and mother gives B gene, baby will be AB. (Type AB)If father gives B gene and mother gives A gene, baby will be AB.

When doing the IVF they will do genetic testing on embryo's before implantation so we know up front..that way if they are not good then no waiting game and onto Egg donor. I am going to see if I can do my eggs and egg donors at same time so I can do an implantation asap and freeze something.I'm just hoping I get a miracle and conceive naturally before my IVF in Dec/Jan due to the costs are insane ($16500 - $30,000 plus)!!! We do not have the $$ but people are donating $$ and we will apply for medical credit. Here's what ***** about this...my husbands father is loaded and his wife, husbands step-mother (all kids have same father) just bought her son and wife a 1.2 mill house!!! It's hard to see the other kids get help and not us..we just want a child...not "things". I can't think about this so I can stay calm and peaceful...all is provided for us but it SUCKSSS.Now- this condition you and I have also comes with other problems-well lets say challenges, more positive. Hypothyroidism...do you have this?- I was diagnosed when I was 19. Here's what I want to find out..insurance covers my blood wrk and meds for thyroid BUT not fertility..so I have thyroid issue and fertility issue due to this missing gene and I think insurance should cover it. You know in some states insurance covers IVF.I also do organic food, herbs and acupuncture. My fsh level was 23!!! Part of our condition is high fsh BUT I found a doc in Israel that has a formula for egg quality/high fsh (go to ivfherbalsupport.com) My fsh went from 23 to 10.7!!!! Wooohoooo and it still is going down. Eastern medicine believe to treat fertility through the kidneys- All my western dr.s support this- my old Dr's who didn't-got rid of them. I find that this genetic issue also causes dehydration not good for kidney's so the previous email from logesh_scientist is right..eat healthy and hydrate.I know this is a lot and a long email- I'm doing a documentary about all this-especially the emotional roller coaster.Do you know of anyone or have Dr's told you that there is a chance to have a healthy baby naturally?	post_6240564

post_6267904	Oct 20, 2010	1227139	1480080	LovePregnant	Hello Love Pregnant,The cerebral ventricle when enlarged is called Ventriculomegly.    By itself can mean absolutely nothing but when found in conjunction with other "markers" could be a possibility for Down syndrome or other genetic abnormalities.    This condition can also resolve in utero by itself without any intervention before birth.Before you become alarmed, there is a large amount of information regarding Ventriculomegly and what it is, and whether it is considered mild or more serious.    (This is dependent on the size of the dilation).Here is a site I like to pass on which completely discusses Ventrigulomegly:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentriculomegalyYou can research the term to find out other information or I can provide you with more.More importantly, the reason they want you to have another sonogram is to look to see if there are more markers that could be associated with any other genetic abnormality.    I can provide you with an entire list of possible markers that they will be looking for.    (Please message me - it's much to large to post as a comment).I also invite you to read my blog and other information with respect to Down syndrome.    I know at this very moment you might be very alarmed and quite concerned.    I am here to provide you any support you need and also to let you know, when I learned my son was diagnosed with Ds (via Amniocentesis) I initially was very stressed because I thought it was something it really wasn't.    You can take a look at my blog here:    http://welcometoourhouse-myjournal.blogspot.com/Please do message me and let me know if you would like any further information and also the listing for other common markers.    (When you message me please just note your post so I can recall why you were asking.)Hang in there, and try not to worry (I know easier said then done).    Just like other markers on their own, it may mean nothing at all.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6264581
post_6207430	Oct 03, 2010	None	1289166	pumpernickelbred	First of all, it's important to understand that the "labwork" on the amnio for all intensive purposes has been completed -- that's how they identified the presence of the translocation.    However, the interpretation would be unclear in your particular situation without further testing on the parents.    Balanced translocations can be inherited and passed on from parent to child, but sometimes they occur as a new translocation, called "de novo."    It is standard practice to test both parents when a balanced translocation is found in amnio or in an infant because it will provide important information on the possible origins of the translocation and other concerns related to balanced translocations.The reason to test both of you is to help identify whether the particular translocation is coming from you or your partner, in which case it would be very reassuring that the baby would not have any problems.    Many people have balanced translocations that are not known until testing is done -- in other words, a balanced translocation does not exclude the possibility of your baby being healthy.The other possibility is that the baby has a new translocation, not coming from either parent, but they would need to compare yours and your partners blood to the baby's lab results to be able to tell if that is the case.    Again, it does not mean the baby won't do well, but if it is a new translocation, then your genetic counselor may advise other additional testing as appropriate.    Hope that helps, and best wishes to you and yours.~eureka	post_6202386

post_6255316	Oct 16, 2010	1326926	1433411	anevers	Becker Myotonia Congenita is not the same as Becker's MDAll forms of myotonia congenita are due to mutations on the CLCN1 gene.Before genetic testing, Becker Myotonia Congenita was distinguished from Thomsen Myotonia Congenita by inheritance and symptom manifestation. Thomsen Myotonia Congenita was found in multiple generations of one family, typically affected the hands and face more severely than the legs, and had an onset very early in life.Becker Myotonia Congenita, on the other hand, was the name given for myotonia congenita that only affected on generation of a family...often times only one member, primarly affected the legs, or upper and lower body equally, and was more severe in general than Thomsen MC.With the advent of genetic testing, they found that, as suspected, Thomsen MC was dominant, and suffers only had to have one mutated CLCN1 allele to have the disorder,while Becker MC was recessive and required a mutation on both CLCN1 alleles.But then it got a little trickier.The more genetic testing was done, researchers started to discover that some mutations that were thought to be recessive could cause myotonia congenita by itself, when the other CLCN1 allele was free of mutations, and in some families, multiple generations were affected by this.Generally speaking though, if you have two primarily recessive mutations, you have Becker Myotonia Congenita, and if you have one mutation alone and have symptoms, you have Thomsen Myotonia Congenita.One thing that has been observed and that is becoming more prevalent in medical literature on the disorder is that people with Becker MC are more likely to have weakness associated with the disorder, in one form or another, and this is generally not seen in those with Thomsen MC.	post_6097526
post_6214217	Oct 05, 2010	1227139	1463956	amyhoney1982	Hi Amyhoney1982,I had a recent post from another person regarding the MTHFR mutation.    There are two mutations that are most common in the MTHFR, and yours is the most common one.    You also have two copies of the mutation which is what the hetrozygous means.    Homozygous is a single copy.Here is a answer I had posted a few days back to the other person, and while it isn't specifically regarding your question, it should answer what you are asking.If you have any other questions after reading this, please message me directly!    The answer I posted here is specific to the other mutation (C677T) but the treatments and problems are the same regardless of the type of mutation.    I know that you specified that you are being treated for it, which is actually very good, since many others do not get treatment for it.*****************I am 37 and have had a miscarriage this past June, a chemical pregnancy last month (which is a loss before end of cycle) and I have a son who has Down syndrome.    I too was recently diagnosed with MTHFR same variant as you, C677T.    This genetic mutation or variant is one of the two common MTHFR variants.    Two common variations of the MTHFR gene are C677T and A1298C but it is important to note that the variant we have is the more problematic of the two with respect to health issues.    Both of the mutations are known to be responsible for miscarriages and also for genetic abnormalities in pregnancies such as Down syndrome and Spina Bifida as examples.    The reason why your doctor may not be as concerned is because you have a single mutation or what they call being Heterozygous. Which means only one allele instead of both was mutated.    When both copies are mutated it's called Homozygous, and this is sometimes more problematic.    There are a few schools of thought on the issue.    One suggests that this MTHFR isn't even proven to be a problem.    (Not enough proven scientific study to confirm or deny on the subject of miscarriage)    Then there is a school of thought that says, yes - MTHFR is proven to be responsible for miscarriage.    The third school of thought is that it is possible that it causes miscarriage but only if you have the Homozygous version.There are many doctors out there who practise treatment no matter which form of MTHFR you have.    There are doctors who don't practice any treatment at all.My personal understanding is if your doctor doesn't know anything or much about the mutation, they will likely follow the school of thought that there is no link or relation to miscarriage.    I have two doctors and the one (my family doctor) admittedly knows nothing about the mutation much less genetics as a whole topic.    My genetics department is on the fence as to whether or not it is problematic for pregnancy (I had to literally beg them to test me for the mutation), and my OBGYN is completely studied on the topic and follows treatment regimens.The other important fact is to know that different studies out there tell you different statistics which is why I believe some doctors feel so differently on the subject.    My local genetics department tells me that there is a 33% (1 in 3) chance that someone could have the mutation (any variant).    Some medical journals say for this specific mutation (C667T) is around 17%.There are things you can do if your physician isn't willing to "medically treat" you.    Because having the mutation means an inability to efficiently metabolize Folic acid and vitamin B9, you need to take more then the average person.    Instead of 0.4mg daily during and before pregnancy, people with the variant need to take at least 4mg daily.    Also, being that homocysteine levels would normally be elevated, taking higher levels of B6 & B12 (or a B complex) is part of the "treatment".    Since the variant is often responsible for blood clotting or thrombosis, many doctors treat with Heparin or Lovenox which are blood thinners, a low dose (81mg) baby aspirin can be taken if your doctor prefers.    I also just read (from another one of my posts) someone mentioning asking the doctor for "5-MTHF, or 5-methyl-tetra-hydra-folate, rather than just a folic acid supplement, if you have MTHFR deficiency, for better absorption".    These are just my own treatments that I had started since my loss this June.You can certainly get a second opinion, because in this genetic situation there are definitely a few schools of thought.    It just depends on what you believe and for myself personally, I would rather cover all my bases to try and have a good pregnancy outcome.    I have seen the benefits of two people I know directly who were treated after several miscarriages who then went on to have healthy full term pregnancies.I hope this helps and if you have any questions, please feel free to message me directly.    One of my girlfriends (here also on MH) is living proof that treatment works.    After 3 miscarriages back to back, she was tested and treated.    She is currently more then half of her pregnancy along.    I am sure she would definitely pass on her knowledge to you.    Her user name is K10road.    I am sure either one of us could help you if you have more questions.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6207924

post_6225129	Oct 07, 2010	419309	320985	beanie83	If your son was delivered at a hospital, newborn screening usually includes testing for PKU, and it most likely would have been identified at birth if your son was affected.

post_6228478	Oct 08, 2010	419309	320985	beanie83	There are literally hundreds (maybe even thousands) of different metabolic disorders, the large majority of which are pretty rare and not usually tested for during newborn screening like PKU is.    Amino acid testing is a good place to start if a metabolic condition is suspected; making a diagnosis will be an important first step.    If a metabolic condition is found, hopefully it will be one that can be managed well and easily corrected.	post_6218026

There are both environmental causes of as well as genetic causes that can contribute to arthrogryposis.

post_6230771	Oct 09, 2010	419309	1382308	kelseybob	Depending on the severity of your husband's arthrogryposis, the question of trying to conceive may lead you and he to do some soul searching.    Both of you may have to consider some difficult questions about how you feel about his condition, and how you feel about the possibility having children with his condition, IF the cause of it were genetic.Discussing the "what ifs" in life and starting a family, how you each feel about the different possibilities, and how each of would deal with issues is an important dialogue to have.    Also, you and your husband may want to seek out a medical geneticist to evaluate your husband's condition; if they are able to identify the cause of his arthrogryposis, it may help determine if the condition is genetic or not, and thereby give you more knowledge about inheritance concerns if starting a family together.	post_6217862
post_6214149	Oct 05, 2010	1227139	1464990	knowledge697	Hello Knowledge697,Welcome!    First I want to have your post moved to Genetics (it's now in the Down sydnrome community).The percentage of risk for birth defects at the level of a second cousin would be similar to anyone else's risk if you were not related unless there are specific genetic concerns within the same family.    Since in many places second cousin marriage is considered legal and not problematic, the concern with birth defects is minimal.    Even with first cousin or less, the risk is actually minimal - again so long as there are no known genetic issues within that family.    If there are genetic issues, the risk would be higher because it is then compounded by having it from both sides.At this point assuming there are no health issues or genetic issues, the risk for complications would be the same as it would be for any other couple.The factor of his age and never haven given birth.    For men, the complications for having babies is not the same as women.    As men age, they reproduce batches of sperm every 45-90 days, and are always manufacturing sperm daily.    For women, we come "equiped" with our eggs from birth.    So as women age, so do our eggs which is why fertility becomes an issue as we age.    Eggs are less "good" as women age, and also we only have a certain amount of eggs, when they are done they are done.    So, for the man, if there are no known sperm or fertility issues, such as low sperm count or lazy/slow sperm, then he should be fine.    The only way to know this is to have a fertility test done.    50% of all fertility issues in fact come from the male in the relationship.    (Older schools of though deemed fertility issues all having to do with or coming from the woman.)If you wish to read more about relatives marrying relatives and the effects on genetics, take a look at this site:http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs16.aspI hope that this helps you, and if you have any other questions, please send me a direct message.    I certainly have more resources I can pass onto you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6211736

post_6160537	Sep 20, 2010	1227139	1438867	slick5679	Hello Slick5679,    I am also sorry I had not answered this sooner.It is very interesting that you should ask this question.    Often many times people are tested (by blood) for genetic type testing, and I don't know initally if the results they get are inheritied forms of genetic problems, or aquired forms.    In the case of LQTS there are a few ways one can have this.    There is the genetic aspect which is inherited because a parent is a carrier of the gene.    There is the medication aquisition, where the person can have LQTS from one of 50 different types of medications.    Thirdly one can aquire LQTS from a major loss of potassium or sodium ions from the bloodstream - which comes from certain health problems such as vomiting, diareah or even aneroxia.    As seen here in this site:    http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/qt/qt_causes.htmlBut if your are sure that both of your children (who are from different fathers) have genetically acquired LQTS, the only thought I have immediately is that the child with LQTS3 could have a genetic mutation from the father?    Did you ever have both fathers genetically tested?    I am interested to know if his father has a genetic mutation of LQTS3.The reason I ask is, if he has LQTS3, and your genetic variant is LQTS 1&2 then your son couldn't have acquired his genetic mutation from you unless you carried the LQTS3 as a mutation also but just didn't have that variant as a dominate allele in yourself and your other son.    The thing is, if he definitely has an inherited LQTS, then it has to come from one or the other parent.    If his LQTS was not genetically inherited, then his could have be from one of the other ways to acquire LQTS but seeing as how LQTS 1,2 & 3 are inherited forms, this would not be.I found a terrific site which explains both LQTS and Genetics.    Only, it doesn't explain if it is possible to pass on more then one type of LQTS but not have it yourself.    It is definitely possible to have several mutations, where even some are silent.    So it makes me then wonder if you have LQTS3 as a silent mutation for you and your other son....    http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=370I found a pretty good forum (that is answered by a genetics doctor) however I am not sure if it is still running currently.    It seems to have a wealth of information regarding LQTS answered by the doctor.        http://www.qtsyndrome.ch/cgi-bin/discus/discus.pl?pg=topicsI am sorry that I haven't been able to answer your question directly, but from what I know about genetics, the fact is when you pass on a variant genetically, the big question is, did your sons receive two variants or one?    (Both alleles are mutated).    If the answer is that they have two copies of the variant (meaning they are homozygous) it comes from both parents, and if this is the case, then both of your sons have a mutation from you and their fathers (albeit different fathers) - which would be very interesting since the chances of having LQTS is around 1:5000.    Not rare, but certainly not that common.    If they are heterozygous then they only have one copy of the variant.If you would like any further information from me, you can message me directly at any time.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6116339

So to sum it up , Myself, my 9 year old & 24 year old have inherited LQTS 3. I wish i could find another pediatric cardiologist , there are not many around here. The one we have is affiliated with CHOP(cildren hospitla of Philly), they are supposed to be really good????

It is disturbing that she read it wrong but do remember, mistakes can happen.    I am just glad that nothing terrible happened as a result.    I hope that you pointed it out to the doctor so that they are aware they caused you so much confusion.

And knowing what material has been exchanged or missing wont tell you what problems can possibly happen but the known concerns would or could be Developmental, Physical or Cognitive delays that may or may not be apparent at birth.I have found some great points for you from a genetics site I often pass on:- The degree of severity of the problems will again depend on the specific autosome and breakpoints involved- The risk of having a child with problems varies according to the specific chromosomes involved in the translocation.Something you may or may not know is that unbalanced translocations usually happen spontaneously at conception but can also happen because one of the parents have a "balanced" translocation.    (In some cases, however, one parent may have a balanced reciprocal translocation themselves that causes no problems for themselves but may cause problems in pregnancy (have a miscarriage) or with the baby's chromosomal make-up - to have either the same "balanced translocation" as the parent or an "unbalanced translocation".)Another interesting point is:    If a child has the same balanced chromosomal translocation in their cells as their parent, the child is unlikely to be affected by the chromosomal rearrangement.Since your child has a "Unbalanced Translocation" my point is to say there is no way of knowing at this early stage (3 months old) if there will be delays.    The fact is, it's always a good sign that cognitively your child seems to be on track.    (Again, that doesn't mean there are no delays.)    One thing that is important for you to consider is to get your child (and at 3 months this is the right time) into Early Intervention therapies.    At the moment since you do not know if your child will have delays, the Early Intervention (EI) therapist's job is to assess and provide therapies for delays.    With the UBC you should qualify for the services and in Canada and US (along with many other countries) the services are free.    I hope that your genetics department has told you about these services.    The EI consultant is there to help you, your family, your most importantly your child and their physician to determine if there are delays and what kinds of therapies or treatments should and can be done to help your child overcome the delays or to help maximize your child's full potentials to meet milestones.It is true that if delays are not apparent early on, there may not be too many delays or serious delays as time goes on but at 3 months it is really early to tell.    I am not an EI, so I can't tell you exactly everything they ***** and look for, but the things you mention that your son is doing sound very typical and right on track.    My son has Down syndrome and so with that I have had a lot of assessments in the first year of our son's life with our EI therapists and consultants.    AND our son is still on track developmentally with typical charts and milestones.    He was on track from birth and still is after 1 year old.    With our son, the only problem he had (health wise) was an 8mm hold in his heart called an ASD.Before my son was born, my question to health care and genetics doctors also was, "could there be any correlation to the amount of health problems and development".    I was told NO.    I also read medical studies that also seemed to suggest that there was no comparison with the amount of heath problems or markers for Ds and the mental or developmental delay problems - even though I had thought perhaps my son might or would be less affected (mentally) because it seemed that he had been less affected health wise with his Down syndrome.    I had no idea if there was any correlation and I think the question was a valid one.    Originally not knowing anything about genetics makes this question reasonable to wonder.If there is anything I can help to pass on to you regarding development or Early Intervention, please do let me know.    You can message me directly (it's definitely easier to get a response or question to me that way since I answer so many posts.)The site that has all this information is:    http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs7.asp#para_5Hopefully that might help a bit with some of your questions.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6182367
post_6188837	Sep 27, 2010	1227139	1454364	indiana2434	Hello Indiana2434,I think there must definitely be.    I too have MTHFR (C677T Heterozygous variant) and also Arthritis (and I believe it was the same HLA-B27 diagnosis).    I take low dose 81mg baby aspirin (amongst other things) each day.    I am having further testing for Factor V Leiden (1691G>A) variant or the prothrombin 20210G>A variant, since receiving the C677T diagnosis.I had just answered a post before where the user was asking about Connective tissue disorders (EDS or Ehlers Danlos syndrome) a post by Hunnybunny one 30Aug here in this Forum.    To me, this person sounded like they were describing me.    I had to wonder if perhaps these are connected in some way.    Do you ever suffer with popping or loose joints?    Or constipation or perhaps anything that the user listed?    I am curious to find out if there is some connection.    But, the thing is - I don't personally have a diagnosis for EDS.    I do know that after reading these I would like to be tested for it though.    Does this sound like you too?    Maybe you can message me directly if you can, with my answering so many posts, it's sometimes hard to tell if and when these specific messages get responses.    (My "watch list" is extremely lengthy.)In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6172238
post_6188767	Sep 27, 2010	1227139	1453135	hjs71	Hello Hjs71,I am 37 and have had a miscarriage this past June, a chemical pregnancy last month (which is a loss before end of cycle) and I have a son who has Down syndrome.    I too was recently diagnosed with MTHFR same variant as you, C677T.    This genetic mutation or variant is one of the two common MTHFR variants.    Two common variations of the MTHFR gene are C677T and A1298C but it is important to note that the variant we have is the more problematic of the two with respect to health issues.    Both of the mutations are known to be responsible for miscarriages and also for genetic abnormalities in pregnancies such as Down syndrome and Spina Bifida as examples.    The reason why your doctor may not be as concerned is because you have a single mutation or what they call being Heterozygous. Which means only one allele instead of both was mutated.    When both copies are mutated it's called Homozygous, and this is sometimes more problematic.    There are a few schools of thought on the issue.    One suggests that this MTHFR isn't even proven to be a problem.    (Not enough proven scientific study to confirm or deny on the subject of miscarriage)    Then there is a school of thought that says, yes - MTHFR is proven to be responsible for miscarriage.    The third school of thought is that it is possible that it causes miscarriage but only if you have the Homozygous version.There are many doctors out there who practise treatment no matter which form of MTHFR you have.    There are doctors who don't practice any treatment at all.My personal understanding is if your doctor doesn't know anything or much about the mutation, they will likely follow the school of thought that there is no link or relation to miscarriage.    I have two doctors and the one (my family doctor) admittedly knows nothing about the mutation much less genetics as a whole topic.    My genetics department is on the fence as to whether or not it is problematic for pregnancy (I had to literally beg them to test me for the mutation), and my OBGYN is completely studied on the topic and follows treatment regimens.The other important fact is to know that different studies out there tell you different statistics which is why I believe some doctors feel so differently on the subject.    My local genetics department tells me that there is a 33% (1 in 3) chance that someone could have the mutation (any variant).    Some medical journals say for this specific mutation (C667T) is around 17%.There are things you can do if your physician isn't willing to "medically treat" you.    Because having the mutation means an inability to efficiently metabolize Folic acid and vitamin B9, you need to take more then the average person.    Instead of 0.4mg daily during and before pregnancy, people with the variant need to take at least 4mg daily.    Also, being that homocysteine levels would normally be elevated, taking higher levels of B6 & B12 (or a B complex) is part of the "treatment".    Since the variant is often responsible for blood clotting or thrombosis, many doctors treat with Heparin or Lovenox which are blood thinners, a low dose (81mg) baby aspirin can be taken if your doctor prefers.    I also just read (from another one of my posts) someone mentioning asking the doctor for "5-MTHF, or 5-methyl-tetra-hydra-folate, rather than just a folic acid supplement, if you have MTHFR deficiency, for better absorption".    These are just my own treatments that I had started since my loss this June.You can certainly get a second opinion, because in this genetic situation there are definitely a few schools of thought.    It just depends on what you believe and for myself personally, I would rather cover all my bases to try and have a good pregnancy outcome.    I have seen the benefits of two people I know directly who were treated after several miscarriages who then went on to have healthy full term pregnancies.I hope this helps and if you have any questions, please feel free to message me directly.    One of my girlfriends (here also on MH) is living proof that treatment works.    After 3 miscarriages back to back, she was tested and treated.    She is currently more then half of her pregnancy along.    I am sure she would definitely pass on her knowledge to you.    Her user name is K10road.    I am sure either one of us could help you if you have more questions.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6167930
post_6146898	Sep 16, 2010	1446412	None	Sue1991	Dear Sue1991Do you really want to stir something up like that?    Does your mother love you?    Does your father love you?    Do your grandparents love you?    If so, then you have more than many people dream of having--you have a family who loves you.Many children are adopted and therefore, do not resemble any family member.    And yet, they love the parents who raise them more than any "real" parent could ever replace.WHY delve into something that will only hurt everyobody's feelings?If you really want to know that much, then take your mother aside in private sometime and try explain to HER how you are feeling.    Ask her in a very sincere way and don't make yourself sound like a teen-aged-smart-alec mouth (I'm not saying that you are).    If she knows that you are sincere and that it really comes from your heart and not just a smart mouth, she will probably be very honest with you.After that, be thankful that you have a family who loves you and LET IT GO.There are too many other things in your life that will be more important.If someday, in the future, you were to have a child with a medical issue, then and only then would there be any real reason to ask.    Otherwise, what purpose would it really serve?Cead	post_6099922
post_6184782	Sep 26, 2010	1408770	None	Cead	Well.. thank you for you input.. very much appreciated.. except.. the reason I do ask is.. because not only is my father unnecessarily controlling and inconsiderate.. not to mention the years of mental abuse.. which just so happens must be a genetic thing with his family because they are all very controlling and inconsiderate.. ha.. but this side of my family.. if it even is my family, does have a genetic problem. Colon Cancer runs in his family, I've been more fortunate then ALL of my other cousins to go this long with no problems, however knowing if he is my biological father or not will have a major roll in the well being of my future children.	post_6099922
post_6109932	Sep 06, 2010	1227139	1428092	suekpurple	Hello Suekpurple,I am so sorry for the late response.I have a son with Down syndrome, and I had a recent miscarriage back in June.    These two incidents prompted me to have the same genetics test which you are referring to, called MTHFR.The thing about MTHFR, besides all the conflicting studies and non confirmed studies regarding this mutation, is that it occurs in 1/3 of the population.    It is extremely common, and there is much debate over what types of treatments actually work with respect to this mutation.The regimen you are on, is the one most often talked about.    The thing that I think is missing from the regimen however is 4mg of Folic acid, which is what this mutation prohibits absorption.    I myself am currently taking low dose 81mg baby aspirin, a full b complex and also 4mg of Folic acid.    The Folic acid is the single most important part of the regimen because the absorption of Folic acid is what is blocked by the mutation - which is why some doctors believe that miscarriages are caused along with the possibility of Down sydnrome or Spina bifida.If there is anything in addition that you would like to know, I have several several resources regarding MTHFR mutation.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6078624
post_6182655	Sep 26, 2010	1227139	1428092	suekpurple	Hello SuekPurple,I just thought to add, (I forgot to mention that your post was in the Down syndrome Forum, and I am having it moved to the Genetics Forum).I wasn't sure if my post helped you, but if you ever needed to chat about your diagnosis, please feel free to message me.    My MTHFR variant is the C677T which is the other common variant to yours.    I too (like you) have one copy which means we are heterozygous.    The two are the most common of all the MTHFR mutations.    So if there is anything else you would like to know about it, please do not hesitate to message me.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6078624
post_6179782	Sep 25, 2010	1227139	1455416	frannygal26	Hello Frannygal26Welcome and I am so happy that you are posting in our forum!    I would love to also direct you to the Down syndrome Community (http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Down-Syndrome/show/166?camp=msc&personal_page_id=1186587) or the Down syndrome Group (http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Down-syndrome/show/749?camp=msc)    I hope you will visit as these two areas are specifically for Down syndrome.I noticed that you posted where you are located.    Can I ask if you have made any contacts with your local Ds Association?    I know that our local associations have some great support staff and resources that could probably help you with some of the stress you are dealing with.    I would love if you could send me a direct message, (in fact please look in your In-box, I will send you a message from me.) and I can pass on some resources that I have found that might help.When did you learn that you had Mosaic Ds?    Did you know this since you were little or was it something you were diagnosed with later in life?    The reason I ask is that I wondered if you were involved in any Early Intervention services.    And I was curious if they provided you with any resources for this time in your life.    The EI services here (in Canada) do provide families with resources for the future.    I am hoping that I can share these with you if you do not have these.You asked about whether you can be under stress with having Mosaic Ds.    Having stress will not affect your Ds unless you have a pre-existing health concern that arose because of having Ds - such as heart troubles or surgeries involving your heart.    The Down syndrome in itself will not cause the stress to affect your body, but if you had heart disease of troubles with your blood pressure for example (like any other person with these conditions, high levels of stress would not be good for you or that person).    But normal everyday stress would not likely be problematic.    These questions are best answered by your doctor though, as they would know your health concerns better then anyone here.I am here to help you if I can.    Is there something that your family could do to help relieve some of your stress that you are feeling?    You mentioned that you have three kids and I think that you mentioned you know it's not good for you to be under a lot of stress.    If you can you figure out or identify what is causing the stress, perhaps suggestions can be made to help you minimize the stress.Having three kids for any mom will be stressful so I hope that you don't think that you are alone or shouldn't be feeling any stress at all.    I commend you for knowing that you feel the stress and are looking for help to deal with it.    You are not alone.    I hope you will message me directly.    (You can send me a direct message by placing your mouse pointer over my name (or users name) and selecting "Send Message").I can't wait to hear from you!In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6176102
post_6087959	Aug 30, 2010	1199196	1428288	hunnybunny1	Look up EDS and diet on the internet.    I think I remember there being zinc, magnesium and possibly vitamin K deficiencies in people with this diagnosis.    Maybe your family has an increased need for these nutrients due to genetic glitches.    And sometimes a problem with one nutrient leads to another nutrient deficiency.    I hope this helps!	post_6087170
post_6160560	Sep 20, 2010	1227139	1428288	hunnybunny1	Hello Hunnybunny1,First off, I wanted to say I am sorry I had not gotten to your post sooner.Secondly, I thought I was reading a carbon copy of myself - so much that I need to message or have you message me directly.    You would not believe that I have EVERY single thing that you list.On an other note, I recently was tested genetically and diagnosed with MTHFR C677T variant.    This is a genetic mutation variant that can affect many things, but often is not diagnosed until your childbearing years.    (Since this mutation seems to be correlated to miscarriage and other reproductive issues).    But, after much research I see that the mutation affects countless other areas of the body.    Just as an off though to your research, you can look into this also.I had not done a lot of research on EDS, but I have certainly come across EDS on many occasions in this forum and others.    I will pass on some other genetics references for you that I have been given with respect to EDS if you can message me.    The most important thing that you must do at this point, (since I too have been through the long list of doctors and diagnoses for each category of health issues) is have some genetics testing done.    Since EDS is genetic, the testing is available.    Here is a fantastic site that I have for EDS and much of my other genetics information:    http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/ehlers-danlos-syndromeI definitely believe that what you discuss as your health issues are genetically related, as I believe my own are.    But the one thing that I have to pass on to you as information is, genetics is very tricky.    When testing for genetics, you do need to know what you are testing for, which makes it almost crazy since you are trying to figure out what is wrong in the first place.    Obviously this makes this situation very difficult.    In genetics testing, it should be better referred to as genetics confirming.    There is no genetics test that can be done that tells you (if you have no idea what is genetically wrong with you) what you have.    Since there are literally about hundreds of thousands of genetic abnormalities and then genetic mutations or variants, it is nearly impossible to test you for everything.    There fore, with the help of a genetics counsellor, (or more so a doctor specializing in the area of concerns that you have - which I do realize tends to be over different areas of the body) an idea of what genetically could be wrong can be suggested to be tested for.    The problem is, (as it is here in Canada) genetics testing is very expensive, and often if you are not dying or some ridiculous other reason like that, they don't really want to do the testing.    And then if you have insurance plans that cover testing, it is often a ridiculous fight to get the testing approved.    The one thing I can say is I sympathize with you on two levels.    First - going through exactly what you are in terms of the actual health side of things, and secondly - the medical diagnosis side is crazy.I would love to chat with you more, because I do believe that you are onto the right path, and possibly some of the information that I have could help additionally.    I definitely would need to know some other details though, so that I can help point you in the right direction.    Feel free to message me directly at any time, and I will get back to you as soon as I can.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6087170
post_6166620	Sep 21, 2010	580989	1428288	hunnybunny1	You are not far from Stanford. You might want to call their Marfan Clinic at 650-725-8246. They also diagnose EDS. I am taking my son to their genetics clinic in November. He is suspected to have EDS.My son has many symptoms like yours, and also extreme myopia, stretch marks and severe orthostatic intolerance. He also has gastrointestinal issues. He was severely constipated for many years, but I believe that was due to hypothyroidism. He is now on Thyroxine and no longer constipated. He does not have much pain, but that may be due to taking cortisone for the last 3 years (for secondary adrenal insufficiency) I believe he definitely has connective tissue breakdown, but since he also has significant growth hormone deficiency, which has led to low protein synthesis, I think this may be the overriding cause of his symptoms. He is 14 years old.He does have significant nutritional deficiencies, among them zinc, magnesium, B vitamins, antioxidants, many amino acids and glutathione. He had 14 abnormalities show up on an organic acids test, done through a clinical nutritionist. None appear to be serious enough to have a genetic cause IMO.Your hips popping out of place, along with your other symptoms, is highly suspect for EDS.    You may need a doctor's referral to see a specialist. If your doctor will not do this, a Stanford doc may be more helpful.	post_6087170
post_6160656	Sep 20, 2010	1227139	1438867	slick5679	Hello Slick5679,    (I noticed that you already had this posted in the Down syndrome forum so I am copying my answer here for you.)    I am also sorry I had not answered this sooner.It is very interesting that you should ask this question.    Often many times people are tested (by blood) for genetic type testing, and I don't know initially if the results they get are inherited forms of genetic problems, or acquired forms.    In the case of LQTS there are a few ways one can have this.    There is the genetic aspect which is inherited because a parent is a carrier of the gene.    There is the medication acquisition, where the person can have LQTS from one of 50 different types of medications.    Thirdly one can acquire LQTS from a major loss of potassium or sodium ions from the bloodstream - which comes from certain health problems such as vomiting, diarrhoea or even anorexia.    As seen here in this site:    http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/qt/qt_causes.htmlBut if your are sure that both of your children (who are from different fathers) have genetically acquired LQTS, the only thought I have immediately is that the child with LQTS3 could have a genetic mutation from the father?    Did you ever have both fathers genetically tested?    I am interested to know if his father has a genetic mutation of LQTS3.The reason I ask is, if he has LQTS3, and your genetic variant is LQTS 1&2 then your son couldn't have acquired his genetic mutation from you unless you carried the LQTS3 as a mutation also but just didn't have that variant as a dominate allele in yourself and your other son.    The thing is, if he definitely has an inherited LQTS, then it has to come from one or the other parent.    If his LQTS was not genetically inherited, then his could have be from one of the other ways to acquire LQTS but seeing as how LQTS 1,2 & 3 are inherited forms, this would not be.I found a terrific site which explains both LQTS and Genetics.    Only, it doesn't explain if it is possible to pass on more then one type of LQTS but not have it yourself.    It is definitely possible to have several mutations, where even some are silent.    So it makes me then wonder if you have LQTS3 as a silent mutation for you and your other son....    http://www.thetech.org/genetics/ask.php?id=370I found a pretty good forum (that is answered by a genetics doctor) however I am not sure if it is still running currently.    It seems to have a wealth of information regarding LQTS answered by the doctor.        http://www.qtsyndrome.ch/cgi-bin/discus/discus.pl?pg=topicsI am sorry that I haven't been able to answer your question directly, but from what I know about genetics, the fact is when you pass on a variant genetically, the big question is, did your sons receive two variants or one?    (Both alleles are mutated).    If the answer is that they have two copies of the variant (meaning they are homozygous) it comes from both parents, and if this is the case, then both of your sons have a mutation from you and their fathers (albeit different fathers) - which would be very interesting since the chances of having LQTS is around 1:5000.    Not rare, but certainly not that common.    If they are heterozygous then they only have one copy of the variant.If you would like any further information from me, you can message me directly at any time.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6116353

Or is she up all night?    Or an early riser?Sleep disturbances are common but it would be good to get a sleep study test for your peace of mind.

Here is my message:Dear Onceg,This question is asked frequently, and the best advice I can pass along is that you speak with a genetics counsellor.    Your situation is different then most, so it is advisable to sit down with a genetics specialist (doctor) and map out the family lines, to ensure your future children are not at risk for serious disease or syndromes.I do often pass along this site, as it is very concise and helpful statistically as well as with percentages with respect to any possible problems genetically that you may pass on.See here:    http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs16.aspI hope this helps.    If you need anything else, please send me a direct message, and hopefully I can help.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6057396

It pertains to all matters (especially genetically) with respect to relationships that are involving cousins or other family lines.    However, if you are seeking professional advise, the best place for you to obtain that would be in the expert forum (as mentioned above) or with your own family physician.    The site I am providing you below talks about the risks in statistical notes and percentages.    I sincerely wish you the best.See this site here:    (It is extremely concise)http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/fs16.aspI hope this additionally provides you some information.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6049093
post_6032020	Aug 16, 2010	1227139	1414759	scared_alone91	Hello Scared_alone91,I wanted to share with you a lengthy post I put out regarding consanguinity.    (Relationships between relatives).    It isn't as terrible as you might think, and in many parts of the world, (today and in the past) consanguinity is commonly practised with the belief that it makes blood lines stronger.This message that I am posting for you is rather deep, and is in two parts because it is lengthy.    I hope that you will find the information useful, and if you need any help in deciphering it, please feel free to message me directly.    I am the Community Leader for Genetics, and a few other Forums here in MedHelp.    See below the stars for the posts:*************************************I hope that my message will give you some clarity.    On the surface the immediate and short answer is there should not be any problem in terms of bloodlines, since that would make their relation second cousins.    However, if there are any known genetic issues, there would be a small percentage of both having the same genetic issue and therefore if they were to have children, it would be passed on.Read my post here and see if any of this relates to you:Here is a fact sheet (Centre for Genetics Education) I have used often to educate others who have the same questions as you do regarding blood relatives:Important points* Consanguinity describes a relationship between two people who share a common ancestor: a 'shared blood' relationship* The most common form of a consanguineous relationship or marriage is between first cousins and in some societies, can account for a large proportion of relationships* Traditionally, some cultures have practised and continue to practise marriage between relatives such as cousins as a means of strengthening family ties and retaining property within the family* We all carry several harmful faulty gene copies on our chromosomes but have a working copy on the other partner chromosome to provide the information for our bodies* Usually two unrelated people will not carry the same faulty gene copyo Children of unrelated parents are at low risk of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic conditiono They have a risk of between 2% and 3% (2 to 3 out of every 100 births) of having a child with a birth defect or disability, many of which will be genetic* People who are blood relatives share a greater proportion of the same genes than unrelated people do because they have a common ancestor such as a grandparent from whom they inherited their genes through their parents* The closer the biological relationship is between relatives, the more likely that they will have the same faulty gene in common* Children of parents who are blood relatives generally have a small increased risk over that of unrelated parents of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic conditiono For example, if parents are first cousins, the risk is a little higher (about twice) ie. 5% to 6% (5 to 6 out of every 100 births). Looked at another way, where parents are first cousins, there is about a 95 chance out of 100 (95%) that they will have a baby unaffected by a condition due to the parents' faulty geneso The chances of having a baby with a problem would be higher, and parents more likely to share the same faulty gene copy, if their parents and/or grandparents are also close blood relatives* In most families where the parents are close blood relatives, there will be no history of a specific condition and there are no tests that can usefully be carried out to see if the baby is at risk for being affected by a particular genetic condition* Where there is a family history, or where the parents' ancestry suggests their risk for having a faulty gene for a condition is increased eg. thalassaemia, genetic testing may be possible to determine if the parents are carriers of the same faulty gene* It is important for couples who are close blood relatives and thinking about becoming parents, to seek genetic counselling to obtain current information and explore their reproductive options.'Consanguinity' comes from two Latin words: con meaning shared and sanguis that means blood. Consanguinity describes a relationship between two people who share a common ancestor: a 'shared blood' relationship; for example, a relationship between two cousins.The most common form of a consanguineous relationship or marriage is between first cousins and in some societies, can account for a large proportion of relationships.Traditionally, some cultures have practised and continue to practise marriage between relatives such as cousins as a means of strengthening family ties and retaining property within the family.Genes and familiesThe cells of the body contain the genes or set of instructions for the cell to make all the necessary proteins (chemicals) for our bodies to grow and work normally.If a gene is changed so that it does not work properly, the gene is described as being faulty (i.e. there is a gene mutation present). The result is that either a protein is produced that is faulty, produced in limited quantity or is not produced at all.Genes come in pairs: one copy of each gene inherited from the mother and one copy from the father. Since there are two copies of the genes in the cells, a change in one of the gene copies that could be potentially harmful will generally have no direct effect on an individual's health: the working gene copy will usually override the faulty copy of the gene. These changes are called 'recessive' (or hidden) to the working copy and the individual is said to carry the faulty gene.Carrying a single faulty gene copy does not usually cause a problem. But if an individual has two copies of the same faulty gene containing a recessive mutation, the cell will not receive the right instructions to enable normal function and may result in the individual having a genetic condition.Importantly, everyone carries several faulty gene copies without having any impact on their health or development.There are thousands of possibly harmful faulty gene copies but usually two unrelated people will not carry the same faulty gene copy.* Children of unrelated parents are at low risk of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic condition* They have a risk of between 2% and 3% (2 to 3 out of every 100 births) of having a child with a birth defect or disability, some of which will be geneticWhile everyone usually has the same number and type of genes, there are small differences in the genetic information between individuals that make us unique. Since our genetic information is passed down to us from our parents and grandparents and so on, family members will have more similarities in their genetic information than differences.Continued in next comment below....	post_6031803

Looked at another way, where parents are first cousins, there is about a 95 chance out of 100 (95%) that they will have a baby unaffected by a condition due to the parents' faulty genesIn general, parents being close relatives has no effect on the number of babies born with genetic conditions that are due to a faulty gene on the X chromosome or a faulty gene that is 'dominant' to the working copy of the gene.It seems likely, however, that when parents are close relatives there will be some increased risk for a child inheriting conditions that are due to a number of different genes acting together (polygenic) or where there is an interaction between genes and the environment such as spina bifida and some forms of congenital heart disease.Unfortunately, what this increased risk actually is for parents in their individual situation is difficult to calculate.A cautionary noteIn societies with a tradition of first cousin marriage, many couples are often more closely related than first cousins are and consequently their risk may be significantly higher.* The risk is much higher than 5% to 6% when both the parents of the first cousin couple - and their grandparents - are also blood relatives* The actual risk that parents in this situation have needs to be worked out for each family during genetic counsellingI know this is a lot of information, but I hope that it helps.    You can apply whatever relates to you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6031803

post_6048097	Aug 19, 2010	1227139	1414759	scared_alone91	Hi there,Aww Honey I am sorry that you are having to deal with so much (especially at your age).    You know, I have met lots of great parents who were pregnant at a young age, and unfortunately many more who weren't.    I think, perhaps in the beginning, your family may be unhappy with the situation, more so because of your age, and maybe also because of the cousin relationship.    But, hopefully you will receive the right support after all the dust has settled.Just remember, your family's anger or frustration will most likely be a result of them wanting what is best for you, (or rather, them had wanting what was the best for you) and their frustration would be from the fact that they may "feel" that they failed you in some way - not that the necessarily have.    It seems to me that you are an intelligent girl, and that you have a good head on your shoulders.    You can probably imagine that they will be upset as you mention, but you also probably can understand why.    If at first they don't seem to be supportive, give them time to adjust - remember, finding out yourself must have been a shock, so to them it will also be a shock.    The best thing you can do to ease the stress or gap (if there is any with the shock) is to prove to them that you will remain mature, and while you are scared (and anyone who finds themselves pregnant at 16 should very well be) you will tackle this situation with the utmost maturity and perhaps explain to them that you know you will have a lot of growing to do as the time nears.    Every expectant mom has a lot of transitioning to do, and even at your age, you are no different.    The only thing is, you have other things that are stressful for you to deal with as well, like school, finances and your partners decision to remain in yours and your child's life.    So many additional worries that other Mom's may not have to face during this transition.    So if you are able to show your family that you are capable of dealing with these things, even if you need their help, it may help them to adjust better to your situation then not at all.I hope that you find support and that your partner is willing to help you through this.    If you need to chat, please know that I am available at any time.Just remember, that everyone (not just you and your cousin) will need time to let this all sink in.    And it is hard for you, but it is hard for them too.    Just be prepared to accept their position, what ever it is, knowing that everyone is entitled to an opinion, even if at the time, it doesn't seem to help you at the moment.    I hope that you all will be able to come together, so that ultimately your baby has support from everyone who matters.If for some reason you find that your family is not supportive, please let me know.    There are lots of good resources that I can hopefully help to pass on to you, but most importantly, please make sure you take care of yourself, as your baby's life depends on how well you take care of yourself.    Make sure you are getting adequate prenatal care and that you are seeing your doctor for your prenatal care.    It is extremely important to make sure that you are monitored during your pregnancy to ensure your health as well as your baby's.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6031803

post_6021558	Aug 12, 2010	419309	1411206	mariaz215	Chromosomes are structures present in every cell, and they usually occur in a sequential numbered order, normally arranged in pairs: a pair of chromosome 1s, a pair of chromsome 2s, etc.    A balanced translocation refers to a situation where a piece of one chromosome re-arranged and attached itself to another number chromosome    (in your case, a piece of 14 and a piece of 15 switched places).    During the process of normal cell division it sometimes happens that pieces of one chromosome attaches to a different numbered chromosome rather than the one like itself.    If the pieces manage to re-attach without losing any parts, it's a balanced translocation.    (Sometimes, if the pieces lose parts, the re-arrangement becomes unbalanced.)There are many individuals who have balanced translocations and are completely healthy.    Very often, balanced translocations are inherited from parents -- while it's possible that this balanced translocation is a new re-arrangement that happened during the pregnancy, it's also possible that the amnio shows it because you or your partner have this 14/15 balanced translocation.You and your partner should have chromosome testing to see if either one of you have the translocation; if so, then it would be very reassuring that the baby would be much like the parent that has it!    If it turns out that neither you nor the father have this translocation, your doctor may be able to order an additional test on the amnio cells called Microarray to check and make sure that the translocation is balanced, and that small pieces haven't been lost in the re-arrangement.Best wishes to you. ~eureka	post_6019252
post_6028804	Aug 15, 2010	1227139	1411206	mariaz215	Hello Mariaz2215,I wanted to say Eureka has explained this wonderfully.    I wanted to add a few things for you to also note and hopefully help you to understand.The important thing is it is impossible from the Amniocentesis to know whether or not your baby with have any serious health complications, but on the positive side, most people who have balanced translocations actually most of the time are not even aware that they indeed have one until they are subjected to a chromosome analysis or Karyotype for some reason such as pregnancy etc.    (Maybe for example in a female who has had several miscarriages, her doctor may refer her to a geneticists to have her karyotype done to see if there may be a genetic reason for her losses.)    Otherwise, many healthy people go through their entire lives not knowing they have a balanced translocation.Also, and that in genetics, it is important to note for further down the road for your baby, her or she will need to know about her translocation if he or she plans to have children down the road.    There is a 25% chance that the translocation can be passed on just as Eureka mentioned that this translocation may have come from either yourself or your partner.    Getting both yourself and your partner tested would be beneficial for you should you also consider having more children.    This will allow you to have proper guidance with respect to your risk factors and odds with the possibility of having other baby's with a translocation (as I mentioned if either of you have the same translocation, the usual assessed risk is approximately 25% to pass it on, but if both of you had this translocation - a rare situation, the odds would need to be re-evaluated accordingly.)I have a few really good sites that I like to pass along that helps to explain translocations and also the specific one that you have mentioned.First here is an illustration of a balanced translocatoin for your reference:    http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/illustrations/balancedtranslocationThis is the definition of a balanced translocation for your reference:    http://generalhealthtopics.com/balanced-translocation-957.htmlThis is a reference to Chromosome 14 translocations with other chromosomes (and the subsequent possible effects):http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/14And this is a reference to Chromosome 15 specifically so that you understand what this chromosome is responsible for :    http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/chromosome/15And the type of translocation that your baby has is called a Robersonian translocation -which is defined as, "Robertsonian translocation: A type of translocation exclusive tothe acrocentric chromosomes (13, 14, 15, 21 and 22) in which two of these chromosomes join at or near their centromeres.    This is effectively a fusion between two whole chromosomes.Here is a reference regarding Robersonian translocation:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsonian_translocationThe reason this translocation is one of the more common ones is because any other translocation not involving the following specific chromosomes - 13, 14, 15, 21, or 22 is not considered viable.    The translocations involving these chromosomes are completely viable, providing they are balanced.I hope that this additionally helps you, and if you need any thing at all regarding information about translocations, and the genetics testing etc, please feel free to contact me.    I am a designated genetics guide (from our local hospital's genetics department) for parents & families who receive genetic diagnoses.    I am also the mother of a son born with Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).    So please do not hesitate to send me a direct message at any time.    I am here to help.    I know how frustrating this can be, especially if no one has taken the time to counsel you on the results of your baby's karyotype (genetic analysis).In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6019252
post_6018503	Aug 12, 2010	1227139	1409710	zoeombi	Hello Zoeombi,I don't think this is a "Genetics" medical issue per se, but yes, having said that having a body that is similar to your parents and those before them, is genetic in make up.    The thing is, are you worried about any medical issues as a result of having short legs?    And when you mention that your legs are short, given your height, it doesn't tell me if your legs are short, or if that is just something you feel.    What is your inseam length?    Is it something where you feel your body is not proportioned to your leg length?    I think you are also mentioning a completely separate issue when you talk about your tummy too.    It is very important to note, if you eat less and less, you will have something called a starvation mode.    This is where your body stops loosing any fat or weight because it recognizes that you are not putting the normal amount of calories it is used to    and so it goes into starvation mode, trying to hold onto everything, (fat stores etc) because your mind and body feel that it wont get the proper amounts.    When this happens, your body slows, (or your metabolism) and therefore, what happens is after when you do decide to re up your intake of calories, your body is still in starvation mode, and will then pack on the weight even more so.    Eating more often, but smaller meals is a better way of getting your metabolism to ramp up, or work faster at burning calories off.    Now, since you have been eating less and virtually nothing, you will have to increase your energy output so that when you do increase your caloric intake you don't pack on the weight as I mentioned.    You will have to do this for a while, (increase your exercise) until your body adjusts and comes out of starvation mode.Back to your legs.    If you have short thick legs, you may have more muscle on your legs and or tend to carry your muscle bulk there.    The only way to prevent adding muscle bulk to your legs if you are prone to building unwanted muscle there, is to do exercises which are high in repetition and low in weight.    This will burn the muscle as well as any fats that may be in that location.    I know you mentioned you exercise 30 mins a day, but if you want to burn the stalkiness off, you will have to do high reps and low weights for this to happen.    A lot of cardio will also do this for you.    Cut out the juices as they tend to be high in sugars (even natural sugars will add unwanted calories).    Drink a lot of water.    This is a great way to hydrate, and also lessen any unwanted calories.    If you are looking for good foods to consider, cut out the flours and wheats.    Eat things with high fibres and no starches or sugars.    Now, don't cut them all out, because high protein diets are good but lots of people can't maintain them and end up putting the weight back on.    I did personally do a high protein diet called Dr. Bernstein, and I lost the weight I was looking to (176 to 141), and I am now at 139 for over a year.    The thing I was seriously doing to keep it from coming back was not cutting out all my fun foods, only eat things in moderation.    I did follow a high protein diet, but I didn't just cut everything out.    This way, when you are done, you don't force your body to rebel when you complete the diet.    Anyway, I think I have gotten off track.    I think that with respect to your legs, I don't think that you will change something that is "genetic" when it comes to your stature, but you can do somethings (like the foods and exersize) that I mentioned to maybe help.    I hope that I haven't made you more confused, but I wanted to ultimately say,    you are most likely beautiful no matter what your legs look like, so please try not to worry about it.    Most times, we can not fight genetics, without doing some serious body or surgery modifications, and i don't ever think anyone should do this.    There are certain things i believe people want to change about their bodies, but not for the reason if they are unhappy with themselves.    No amount of surgery will change your feelings if you are not happy inside.Please let me know if I can help to explain any of the things I mentioned above, you can message me directly to my in-box anytime.    I have put together this diet I am speaking about for other MH members in the past, since I don't think Dr. Bernstein's is available everywhere, and I am also unaware of where you reside.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6014130

post_6018460	Aug 11, 2010	1227139	1407573	donia79	Hello Donia79,First off:If she has MPS, it is treatable, in that she can do things to reduce her symptoms (Symptom-based treatments), and possibly prevent other more serious complications from occurring that would normally and possibly seriously impair her functions such as blindness or paralysis if the disorder is not cared for.    The specifics about this disorder is that your daughters body is incapable of producing (or deficient in) the enzyme arylsulfatase B (ASB) that is responsible for the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycosaminoglycan (GAG) which must constantly be broken down and recycled in order to maintain normal health.I too am a bit confused with your test results.    What kind of test did you have done to determine the MPS for your daugter?    The thing is, since MPS is genetic, an iherited disorder/syndrome, the test for this is very specific, and usually a geneticsts does either a blood test (which does a karyotype) to determine it's existance.    I found this passage, "Even though diagnosis of MPS VI is often delayed, once a person sees a geneticist or metabolic specialist definitive diagnosis can happen relatively quickly. This is because MPS VI can be diagnosed using laboratory tests."This information was found from a site (http://www.maroteaux-lamy.com/English/Patient/FAQs.aspx?gclid=CI2FnOuLs6MCFUsJ2god9WtA3g#faq7)And in that site, the following characteristics are often found in children/adults with MPS.*    Short stature* Gradual coarsening of facial featuresâ  including broad nose, flat nasal bridge, thickened tongue and lips, large head, short neck, and unusually prominent eyes* Cloudy cornea (outer cover of eye)* Frequent ear infections, sinus infections, or pneumonia* Noisy breathing or a tendency to get out of breath easily* Heart murmur, which a physician may notice when listening to the heart with a stethoscope* Bulging of the abdomen, caused by enlargement of the liver or spleen* Hernias of the navel or groin* Stiffness of joints, including the shoulders, elbows, hands, hips, and knees* Unusual changes in the shapes of various bonesONE THING IS DOES NOT SEEM TO AFFECT IS the cognitive or learning aspect.    Intelligence is noted to be typical.If I were you, depending on how your daughter arrived at her initial and secondary diagnosis, I would consult (get a referral) to a genetics counsellor and doctor to have her genetic analysis done, which is called a Karyoypte, which will definitively tell you all about her make up and whether she has MPS.    I know of no way a genetic abnormality or inherited disorder can be positive on one test and negative on another, unless the test performed was not a genetics test, which is specific to determining genetic issues.You asked what you can do.    There is no way to cure a genetic disorder but there are some thoughts on this particular medical issue that you could look into or research yourself.    One is called, hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).    The second is, Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT).    If you read the site I provided you with, you can read up on those two new forms of treatments, and see if those are some options in which you might consider.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_6014553

post_6014323	Aug 10, 2010	419309	1396306	Daniellegb	Hemoglobin variant identification is fairly new.    For many years, there were only several know variations identified (alpha-globin, beta-globin, etc);    however in recent years, especially with the development of blood testing technologies and gene sequencing many previously undescribed/unnamed hemoglobin variants are being studied.It's important to note that most people who carry hemoglobin variants do not suffer any health issues as a result of having a variant trait.If you are interested in learning more or doing more research on your particular hemoglobin, it might be worthwhile to see if your pediatrician still has info about what organization was doing the research.    If that information is not readily available, you can call large teaching hospitals (medical centers that are affiliated with large universities) and/or check with Hemotology specialists in your area.    Best of luck. ~eureka	post_5966727

See here if you haven't already:http://www.medhelp.org/lib/pku.htmhttp://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=phenylketonuriaI believe if you speak to your genetics counsellor, you can have this PKU tested by doing a Karyotype.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_5985080
post_6014292	Aug 10, 2010	419309	1401650	jehlee	A routine chromosome study, also commonly referred to as peripheral blood karyotype, does not usually check for PKU.    In the United States, all newborns are screened for PKU using biochemical testing (not chromosome testing) after birth.    It is possible to test for PKU using gene testing, but the process is considerably longer and more expensive.    Genetic testing for PKU would involve DNA mutation analysis, which is quite different from chromosome analysis.    Hope that helps. ~eureka	post_5985080
post_5995146	Aug 05, 2010	1227139	1401834	black_butterfly	Hello Black_butterfly.First I just want to get your post moved from the Down syndrome Forum to the Genetics forum.In answer to your question, the most important fact is how distant is your relationship.    There is a post I put out regarding dating a relative, and whether it is safe to have children.Please read this:Here is a fact sheet (Centre for Genetics Education) I have used often to educate others who have the same questions as you do regarding blood relatives:Important points* Consanguinity describes a relationship between two people who share a common ancestor: a 'shared blood' relationship* The most common form of a consanguineous relationship or marriage is between first cousins and in some societies, can account for a large proportion of relationships* Traditionally, some cultures have practised and continue to practise marriage between relatives such as cousins as a means of strengthening family ties and retaining property within the family* We all carry several harmful faulty gene copies on our chromosomes but have a working copy on the other partner chromosome to provide the information for our bodies* Usually two unrelated people will not carry the same faulty gene copyo Children of unrelated parents are at low risk of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic conditiono They have a risk of between 2% and 3% (2 to 3 out of every 100 births) of having a child with a birth defect or disability, many of which will be genetic* People who are blood relatives share a greater proportion of the same genes than unrelated people do because they have a common ancestor such as a grandparent from whom they inherited their genes through their parents* The closer the biological relationship is between relatives, the more likely that they will have the same faulty gene in common* Children of parents who are blood relatives generally have a small increased risk over that of unrelated parents of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic conditiono For example, if parents are first cousins, the risk is a little higher (about twice) ie. 5% to 6% (5 to 6 out of every 100 births). Looked at another way, where parents are first cousins, there is about a 95 chance out of 100 (95%) that they will have a baby unaffected by a condition due to the parents' faulty geneso The chances of having a baby with a problem would be higher, and parents more likely to share the same faulty gene copy, if their parents and/or grandparents are also close blood relatives* In most families where the parents are close blood relatives, there will be no history of a specific condition and there are no tests that can usefully be carried out to see if the baby is at risk for being affected by a particular genetic condition* Where there is a family history, or where the parents' ancestry suggests their risk for having a faulty gene for a condition is increased eg. thalassaemia, genetic testing may be possible to determine if the parents are carriers of the same faulty gene* It is important for couples who are close blood relatives and thinking about becoming parents, to seek genetic counselling to obtain current information and explore their reproductive options (see Genetics Fact Sheet 3)'Consanguinity' comes from two Latin words: con meaning shared and sanguis that means blood. Consanguinity describes a relationship between two people who share a common ancestor: a 'shared blood' relationship; for example, a relationship between two cousins.The most common form of a consanguineous relationship or marriage is between first cousins and in some societies, can account for a large proportion of relationships.Traditionally, some cultures have practised and continue to practise marriage between relatives such as cousins as a means of strengthening family ties and retaining property within the family.Genes and familiesThe cells of the body contain the genes or set of instructions for the cell to make all the necessary proteins (chemicals) for our bodies to grow and work normally.If a gene is changed so that it does not work properly, the gene is described as being faulty (i.e. there is a gene mutation present). The result is that either a protein is produced that is faulty, produced in limited quantity or is not produced at all.Genes come in pairs: one copy of each gene inherited from the mother and one copy from the father. Since there are two copies of the genes in the cells, a change in one of the gene copies that could be potentially harmful will generally have no direct effect on an individual's health: the working gene copy will usually override the faulty copy of the gene. These changes are called 'recessive' (or hidden) to the working copy and the individual is said to carry the faulty gene.Carrying a single faulty gene copy does not usually cause a problem. But if an individual has two copies of the same faulty gene containing a recessive mutation, the cell will not receive the right instructions to enable normal function and may result in the individual having a genetic condition.Importantly, everyone carries several faulty gene copies without having any impact on their health or development.There are thousands of possibly harmful faulty gene copies but usually two unrelated people will not carry the same faulty gene copy.* Children of unrelated parents are at low risk of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic condition* They have a risk of between 2% and 3% (2 to 3 out of every 100 births) of having a child with a birth defect or disability, some of which will be geneticWhile everyone usually has the same number and type of genes, there are small differences in the genetic information between individuals that make us unique. Since our genetic information is passed down to us from our parents and grandparents and so on, family members will have more similarities in their genetic information than differences.Continued in next comment below....	post_5985815
post_5995148	Aug 05, 2010	1227139	1401834	black_butterfly	Continued from comment above....* People who are blood relatives share a greater proportion of the same genes than unrelated people do because they have a common ancestor such as a grandparent from whom they inherited their genes through their parents* Children of parents who are blood relatives generally have a small increased risk over that of unrelated parents of inheriting from each of their parents a copy of the same faulty gene that could result in a genetic condition* For example, if parents are first cousins, the risk is a little higher (about twice) ie. 5% to 6% (5 to 6 out of every 100 births).

Looked at another way, where parents are first cousins, there is about a 95 chance out of 100 (95%) that they will have a baby unaffected by a condition due to the parents' faulty genesIn general, parents being close relatives has no effect on the number of babies born with genetic conditions that are due to a faulty gene on the X chromosome or a faulty gene that is 'dominant' to the working copy of the gene.It seems likely, however, that when parents are close relatives there will be some increased risk for a child inheriting conditions that are due to a number of different genes acting together (polygenic) or where there is an interaction between genes and the environment such as spina bifida and some forms of congenital heart disease.Unfortunately, what this increased risk actually is for parents in their individual situation is difficult to calculate.A cautionary noteIn societies with a tradition of first cousin marriage, many couples are often more closely related than first cousins are and consequently their risk may be significantly higher.* The risk is much higher than 5% to 6% when both the parents of the first cousin couple - and their grandparents - are also blood relatives* The actual risk that parents in this situation have needs to be worked out for each family during genetic counsellingI know this is a lot of information, but I hope that it helps.    You can apply whatever relates to you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_5985815
post_5973501	Jul 30, 2010	1227139	1396306	Daniellegb	Hi Daniellegb,First I wanted to make sure I move your question to the Genetics forum.And as far as knowing where you would be able to send your blood for investigation, you would definitely have to consult with a genetics specialist, such as found in your local hospitals.    The doctors in that department, would be able to better advise you how to go about doing this, and who you would need to contact in order to get it started.    No where would just allow you to send your blood, without having all the background and information about what the doctors were supposedly presuming was so rare or abnormal and a genetic condition.    They would probably need the karyotype of you and your parents, (and if they identified that this genetic abnormality was from your mother, that would have been done.)    before they do anything further.    They would want to know which genetic testing was conducted, and they would want to see those results.Since it was determined that this was genetic, again I am suggesting that you contact your local hospital's genetics department, which to do that, you will likely need a referral from your family physician.I hope that this points you in the right direction, and that it will help you.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator	post_5966914

post_6809992	Apr 09, 2011	1147527	None	heartfluttersflyawayplx	I talked with mom last night when things were pretty lucid. We agreed she would not stay alone any more because she looses track of time and I dont want her to be afraid. I told her if I need to go somewhere alone we will get someone to come and sit with her while I am gone. I could tell she felt badly that this is happening to her and it has come to that but she agreed. I have a Dr appointment next week that I need my son to take me to, my daughter in law said that she and the kids would come along and we would bring Mom too. No one really understands how tired and confused she gets in unfamiliar areas until they see it for themselves. It would be better if they could stay at home with her, but they need to see what happens for themselves I guess.I have had cognitive difficulties in the past from a pretty nasty health issue myself. I feel I can empathize with my mom because I see her struggling with money and paper work and the look on her face is the feelings I have when the fog descends. The relief when it lifts is profound, but I always dread the times it will return with flares. I imagine that I am most suited to deal with her because of my experiences, I have walked in her moccasins so to speak. The difference is she will not have the fog lift.Is there anything her Dr. can give to her to make her not become so upset? She is very sensative to medicine so most pills seem to work oddly on her. She will not take a sleeping pill as she is afraid she will not wake up at night and will wet the bed.Any other experiences or advice is appreciated. Thank you heartfluttersflyawayplz for you post and I hope things become easier for you somehow.	post_6806525
post_6829908	Apr 16, 2011	212161	None	None	i think that was a wise move to not leave her byself. in the begaining my mom agreed to never being byself but as she got futher into it , it made her mad that we would not let her stay byself, she forgets she has this problem. there are times shes great and 5 mins later she hard to deal with. we took her to see a new phy and she has put her on a pill called respadome its to help when shes not being nice and hard to handle, we are trying it out. plese know that when your mom startes turning on you that its not her. my mom has always been a very sweet lady but this has changed her sometimes into a mean old lady, she has wished me death and tells others me and her hubby are going to kill her. it gets really bad for the care takers and you will need help you can not do it byself. its good for others to see that its not a easy job to do. my mom also takes zoloft and klonopin to help with her confuseing and nerves. not sure what we would do without the pills. i pray your mom has a great weekend and that hers moves very slow so ya can have good times together. that part is gone for me and my mom she lives in the past and never feels good or wants to go off. so take every min you can and try and make it good for her.	post_6806525
post_6832319	Apr 17, 2011	1147527	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	thank you for your words of advice. Today is my moms 87th birthday. I will bake her a cake and invite a few close family and friends to come over. This will most likely be the last birthday she will be able to really participate in. I bought her two six packs of pansies her favorite flower and we will plant them in a container by the back door so she can enjoy them everytime we go in and out. She will also be able to see them from the kitche. She has had some good days lately but we have just been home with a very stable schedual. Things fall apart when we go away from home or we have to go to her apartment to sort through items. That is done thank heavens. I dont know what the future holds for us, I dont think it will be good. God has always cared for me and I ask his intervention for us in this also and trust in his judment as always. I wish for one thing for her today that my selfish brother in my home town would call her and tell her he is sorry for acting so horrible to her and I wish my brother in Missouri would show up to see her today. Neither will happen but that is what she wants above all else for her birthday. My brothers will someday be incredibley sorry or maybe they wont. maybe they just dont get it.

post_6865861	Apr 29, 2011	1147527	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	thank you for the open invitation to talk to you. I imagine I will use it. It has been trying off and on. When mom gets tired she becomes more difficult but dont we all :). She however becomes incredible scattered and falls apart memory wise. We went to the coin was yesturday and she insisted on standing in front of the dryer watching the clothes go around. I kept asking her to come and sit down. Finally she did. I asked her why she was over there and she said she needed to be there to take them out as soon as they were dry so they wouldnt wrinkle, (they had been in all of a couple of minutes) she has no concept of time any more. If I get up to check on something she follows me like a little puppy. I have a constant shadow. She is hard of hearing so turns the TV up to ten decibles when I go into my room to escape and to watch somthing different on my set she comes in there to see what I am doing without knowcking. I have started getting atypical migraines, cant be from the stress. I have on average four a week. no pain usually just aura, muscle trembling of the face,vision flickering and feeling unweel during it. My Dr has increased my anti seizure meds in a effort to stop them. hope it works.We went to get a new power of attorney made today. She had one with me as power of attorney for over twelve years but while I was in the hospital she decided I was sick so she would name my sister in law power of attorney.Didnt even discuss it with me. Obviously was not in a clear frame of mind. I cant believe my sister in law did that with out talking to me but she did took mom to the bank and had a notary republic change it over.    Now mom is living with me they are not helping or even speaking to mom and I had to take her to have it changed again because of that ridiculaous mess. My lawyer assessed her and found her competent enough to change the power of attorney. She puts on the m ost ridiculous little act when she meets people. it absolutely makes me want to wretch sometimes, that sounds horrible but if you could see what I deal with at times and then see her sweet little old lady act to them you would get what I meen. Oh my gosh! When the lawyer left the room I told her she should get some sort of award for acting likd such a sweet little old lady and she just smiled like a cat and said I am a sweet little old lady and then pinched me so hard she left a horrible bruise. Now she is mad because I told the lawyer to make my brother in Missouri the alternate to care for her if something happens to me. She said it should have been my brother in our home town here in this state but he wont answer the phone when we call or talk to her so how is he supposed to care for her? I dont believe he would have her best interests at heart he is spoiled and has made some poor life decisions that I dont want my mom involved in. My brother in Missouri is a minister and would if nesseccary move mom down there with him if I was no longer able to care for her.It does become a mess doesnt it? There is so much to think of and the family that you think will back you up reverts back to their childhood ways and acts the way they did when you were kids instead of like the adults they need to act like. I feel like the one and only adult in the whole damn situation and sometimes it is incredibly lonely and painful. Thank heavens for this forum.	post_6806525

I have lupus and my joints hurt so when I turn over it wakes me up. Some times I just get up and come out and check my onlin stores, I sell vintage jewelry on three online shops and in the night I often have International customers asking questions so that works out pretty well, I catch those right away. They are alway shocked they dont have to wait for their answers to their questions. :).I called one place that I found on the internet, but they were so pushy I finally told them to leave me alone, not a good fit at all.I tried to get mom interested in goint into the senior citizens in town they have a active    center there where she could meet other people and visit for a few others. Her neuro said that would be really good for her to do that but she said she wouldnt know anyone there so she didnt want to go. So difficult to get her interested in anything outside her comfort zone at this stage.My brother wants her to come and visit him in missouri for a week to ten days and I want her to go. It would be good for everyone. She doesnt want to go unless I come. I told her I can not leave my online stores. Not true, I just need some time    to breath and not have the TV at ten decibles. My brother is going to get a rude awadening. I dont think she will be able to keep the act up for ten days. Hah.Boy it is good to hear that I do not imagine that nice little old lady act. I was beginning to think that I was loosing it. When she patted me on the arm the other day and said I was a pretty good girl I was shocked beyond belief, but she went back into character by giving me the horrible bruise by pincing me when the lawyer left the room. wher I protested she told me it didnt hurt me. Let me tell you it did hurt me, it was all I could do not to cry it hurt so badly. She has pinching down to an art and does it when you displease her. I have to really watch her.Thank you for being there for me to talk with. I will have a hearing in my divorce on the eleventh and then I will probably be talking to my brother about having her take a trip to visit them.

Bad computor. What will we do on mothers day? beats the heck out of me. I vote we stay home and build the supports for my window boxes and have Pizza Hut deliver, but not sure what she will be up for. I bought myself a puppy to replace the two I lost in a awful tragedy long story not for here. It is a birthday present to myself. He will be ready in June and I will have to drive at least half way to Oklahoma to pick him up. My mom announced she had always gone with me to get my puppies, I really do not think that is a good idea this time. I can just imagine a car trip with mom that far away oh no! I think I will try to time her trip to my brothers for during that time.Take care of yourself over the weekend.	post_6806525
post_6789341	Apr 01, 2011	1651947	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Hi Barbara.    My mother-in-law is 84 and has days that she's totally out of it.    She has been diagnosed with dimensia but it seems more like early stages of Alzheimer's (my grandmother had Alzheimer's).    She has a tendency to become violent when confronted with things she doesn't like or understand.    You and your father should talk with her doctor to let him know her current behavior and find a possible solution to the refusal for the meds.    Dealing with the diabetes is top concern, then the rest can be dealt with.    If the doctor seems to fluff off your concerns, FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR!!!    It seems that the seniors are fluffed off so much, but they require more attention than we do.    There are medications to calm her, but watch out for all possible side effects.    Please let me know how things work out.    It's hard to watch a parent fall apart and not be able to put all the pieces to together for them. Corrine	post_6777412

Given her diabetes diagnosis would make a stronger case that this may be likely.    A consult witha Neurologist would be strongly encouraged.	post_6777412

Alzheimer's and non-Alzheimer's.Non-Alzheimer's dementia can be due to many different things, from a prion infection to a retrovirus infection (HERV-W) to ischemia.Drugs, specifically Lipitor and the statins can also induce dementia because cholesterol is necessary to formulate memory.You really need a neurologist and an in-person examination to provide you with the answers you seek.	post_6726172

Some of the residents there like it, and some don't.Trivia, or just board games that she might have played before the decline.Try googling activities with people who have dementia and see what you get =)I think it's great that you're keeping her active, keep up the great work!	post_6651430

She'd repeat a lot of the same behaviors, but at least she felt like she was doing something and I think it made her feel better.    Even just watching a favorite movie of hers was a good distraction.

There is a medication called clioquinol that seems to slow progression of the disease by half. It has not had enough studies though. It was used in the 40s-70 s for dysentary. It was taken off the market due to side effects.    It's being studied for other things now such as cancer treatment. A compounding pharmasist should be able to get some for you.	post_6578463

post_6457905	Dec 16, 2010	1427317	676326	birdie0907	If what you say is correct then where has this device been hiding for the past 2 years.I appreciate your comments, but patent piracy takes place all the time.    You are aware in 1979 Jack nickelson did a commercial for a water powered Chevy Nova.    It as well as many other patents like Royal Rife's cure for cancer by using frequencies tuned to the resonating frequency of the target (in his test using live cancer cells) which basically vibrated them till they rupture.Through out history Corporations, as well as the military have controlled patents that if let out would change the world as we know it for the better.You can thank JP Morgan for doing just this to Tesla, after he found out that he had invented a way to transmit power without wires.    Once JP realized there was no way of metering the usage, Tesla experienced first hand how evil individuals can be, the rest of that story is history.As for the "UFO" type crafts people think are extraterrestrial, they are mistaken.    And understand the technology these crafts use, does not break any of our laws of physics and when you do the research you will find a un mentioned video of an individual that explains how its done and Im not talking about Bob Lazar.The military is behind the suppression of technology in the energy industry more so than big oil and gas.    This I know personally having a patent on an electrode used in the production of usable fuel from water.    You can google my user name and see my videos and even go to overunity.com and search for the same name and youll see the independent studies don't in France on my work.As for medical devices, we are at the mercy of Big Pharma/Big Gov that regulates everything.    And as history shows us the greed of a few individuals in positions of power, allow them to put a price tag on the technology which is compared to the profits that can be made if the disease is maintained/treated but not cured.Its a vicious cycle of corruption that forces individuals to either be bought out, silenced, or discredited, in order for those in charge to stay in charge and reap profits for as long as they see fit.As for me, I give the knowledge of how to build my product away for free.    I do this after dealing running head on into the power structure I just mentioned.    My open-source structure eliminates any way for them to discredit/silence or buy out while still allowing the knowledge to be propagated world wide for other to build, test, and modify, just not to mass produce and sell. (thats the reason for my patent)    Of course this also eliminates my ability to make a profit from the sale of this invention, but that doesn't stop me from making a profit from other non world changing products while enjoying the ability to use my open-source ways to generate income via advertising and several other methods associated with the free item I give to the world as a gift.No man should ever attempt to make a profit on an invention that can change the world for the better.    Because when he does he opens himself up for attack and the product usually never sees the light of day.    If they do the right thing and give it away for free they will see the return is much larger then any sum of money could ever be.sorry for the long email, but you struck a personal cord.    ;-)	post_6431946

post_6721975	Mar 09, 2011	547368	None	None	Hello Big,It's my understanding that is depends on your ability to pay. If you have long term care insurance or your stay is covered by Medicare your SSI is not touched.If however you have no funds to pay for the stay then I do believe they require you to turn over the majority of your SSI Check.Many short term stays are covered by Medicare. Check with the Social Worker or Admissions Department of the Nursing Home. They will be able to tell you how your stay may be covered.Best of Luck to You,~Tuck	post_6720410
post_7943682	May 11, 2012	1446412	547368	Tuckamore	If a person receives SSI, that person is automatically eligible for Medicaid.    It is the Medicaid benefit that pays the nursing home.    Because it is for a medical placement and medical reasons of the person that Medicaid is paying for, rather than just paying someone's "rent" in a long term care facility,    there are therefore, no out of pocket co-pay for the SSI recipient.If the person has what is called Medi-Medi (Medicaid and Medicare), then Medicare is usually primary and Medicaid will pick up the remainder.    Therefore, there is no out of pocket co-pay for the SSI recipient who is receiving nursing home medical care.If the person is in a nursing rehab home, the person can keep their SSI benefits because Medicaid is for medical payments and SSI is for the person's daily living needs.    This is not necessarily so if that person is in a group home or long term care facility where they may receive care that is not strictly medical and they are just "living" there.    If that is the case, then a part of their SSI benefit would then go towards their "rent" because a group home or long term care facility is a "living" placement option and is not a "MEDICAL" placement.One thing that they can do to minimize the hit to their SSI benefits if they are in a group home or long term care is to apply for a HUD housing voucher.    That can be applied to the resident's "rent" and therefore, maintain more of their SSI funds for personal use.It is confusing but I hope this helps.It would have been helpful to know what level of care the person is placed in.    I have the impression that you mean a nursing rehab facility.    But I am not sure by your post.    If that is what you mean, then the answer is what I said in the first paragraph	post_6720410
post_7947196	May 12, 2012	144586	None	None	No. Generally there is a full year before the regulation takes effect that the home will receive 100% of the check and will then provide fifty dollars every month personal cash. The home will provide eyeglasses and reasonable clothing and shoes without charge.	post_6720410
post_6475953	Dec 22, 2010	547368	None	None	Hello Soniam,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am glad that you found us and took the time to post.You don't offer a lot of detail so I am assuming so things here. Please correct me if I am in error.The most important part of skin care for any age group from baby to elderly is cleanliness. After each incontinent episode you must clean the skin thoroughly with a good cleansing soap like Dial, Ivory or some type that does not contain fragrances. Dry the skin by patting it dry and not rubbing. I would then suggest some kind of a protective skin barrier like A&D, Vaseline or baby "diaper" products. You can discuss this with your pharmacist as he/she will have the best suggestion for these products.It's important to clean and dry asap following each incontinence episode. Do not allow the skin to be in contact with bodily fluids any longer then absolutely necessary.Try to see that the elderly person is drinking enough fluids so there urine is not so concentrated that it actually "burns" the skin. Sometimes cranberry juice can help change the PH and make the urine less caustic.Also frequent position changes will promote better circulation and is helpful in promoting good skin turgor. By frequent I suggest every hour until the skin clears.If this elderly person has open skin lesions it's best to consult a physician. I am not an expert and my suggestions come from personal experience.I hope this helps and that you'll let us know if these approaches/suggestions are beneficial.Best of Luck to You,~Tuck	post_6475443

post_6538148	Jan 12, 2011	547368	None	None	Hi Brooke,Thanks for letting us know you are still monitoring.First, Bless your heart for being brave enough and having enough love in your heart to take on the challenge of caring for your dear grandmother. I did the same for mine, although in the end I had to let her go to a nursing home. I could not keep up with the physical demands. Your situation is not unusual...though I know how very alone you must feel right now!I don't have the "legal" answers for claiming the money your grandmother gives you. If SHE claims the money, obviously you will have to also.My grandmother and later my dad paid small amounts to me for room and board. I mean small amounts. I was told I did not have to claim it as income. But remember it was a very small amount....not even close to 400 a month. You best bet to to ask a tax preparers that question. You can do so anonymously.Caregiving is a very tough job! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. If it weren't everyone could do it. All of us get tired, worn out and stressed. It is near impossible to do alone, without some kind of support.I encourage you to look into options. Your local county social service office should have information for you. Your grandmother may be eligible for support benefits, such as Home Health Care. Medicare will cover this in some situations. How is her medical condition?Your family is angry for many reasons. In my opinion one of them are that you have the strength and gift to care for grandmother and they don't or won't. That makes them face that fact. It doesn't make them bad or weak, it makes them different then you. Some ppl can just not be Caregivers...and shouldn't be!Please seek assistance. You need support. You also need to get out.....if nothing more then to return to work a day or two a week. If that is not feasible then look to support groups or other similar options. They are out there.I had days similar to yours. It's normal. You are not a failure. Please keep in touch. If you have additional questions please feel free to ask. Most importantly we are here to support you!!    We do know the challenges you are facing.My heart goes out to you.Blessings,~Tuck	post_6488222

post_6594461	Jan 29, 2011	547368	None	None	Hello Vampgirl,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. Please excuse my tardy response. I sincerely hope you are still monitoring the forum.I don't know the laws of Ontario...or the services that they offer ppl with disabilities. What I do know is you cannot be forced to care for your mother. So relax. You are taking the right course by investigating the options available.I am only guessing that your mom must be frightened by the possibility that she may be left alone, without assistance. If this were to happen she may require a long term care facility. Many ppl fear that option.In the USA the options available depend on the severity of a person's disability. Could she manage in an assisted care facility...or a senior housing unit....or would she require constant supervision and nursing care in a long term care facility?    These are things that must be taken into consideration.In the USA you would have no say at all in your mother's care or living arrangements unless you were her POA in some form. Your mom may just be looking for your reaction when she tells you that you'll have to be her caregiver. She may be laying the seeds to "guilt" you into caring for her.Caregiving is a privilege for many of us. However we are all made differently...that's what makes us unique.... and some ppl do not find caregiving rewarding. It's also true that though we may be able to be a caregiver for one person, we could not be a caregiver for another. Don't allow your mom to upset you. Again, she cannot demand that you be her caregiver so investigate your options.Once you have gathered all the information and options now may be a good time to discuss this with your mother. However you may also choose not to discuss it until and IF the time ever arises that mom would require/expect your care. You know her best.Please let us know how this turns out for you. I'll look forward to hearing from you again soon.Best of Luck to You,~Tuck	post_6581813
post_6594388	Jan 29, 2011	547368	None	None	Hello Cookiemedic,Welcome to the Caregiver's Forum.Potassium supplements, other than the small amount included in a multivitamin, should be taken only under your doctor's supervision. If your lab values indicate hypokalemia (low potassium), your PCP will prescribe the correct form of potassium.Here's the difference in the Potassium :Potassium chloride is a common supplement given to people with low potassium levels who also have reduced blood levels of chloride. This is generally available only by RX. If you are able to find it OTC you should not take it without your PCP approval. Too much Potassium (hyperkalemia) can be as harmful as too little.Potassium gluconate is also a dietary supplement. Potassium gluconate is recommended when a person has a normal chloride level or when a person should have chloride restricted. You will find Potassium in this form in multivitiams or similar dietary supplements....usually in a low dosage level.Please let us know how you are doing. I hope this information has been helpful.Take Care,~Tuck	post_6592060

Does the senior neurologist know about those brain scan results?    If not, please insist on speaking to him and make sure HE personally knows about it!I don't want to unduly alarm you, but if indeed your father has hydrocephalus    (which causes dialated ventricles), and your father is still feeling the pressure in his head, the medicine he is taking does NOT sound sufficient and he needs to be seen RIGHT AWAY, not wait even 1 day!I hope you were able to read and understand what I sent you by private message, including normal treatment for this life threatening problem.    Please see private message for info I found today you may find very relavant to your father's condition.See also info here on medhelp:http://www.medhelp.org/medical-information/show/1277/Hydrocephalushttp://www.medhelp.org/medical-information/show/1277/Hydrocephalus?page=1#sec_15500http://www.medhelp.org/medical-information/show/1277/Hydrocephalus?page=1#sec_15502	post_6740813

Also, see private message about brain ventricle enlargement and treatment, etc..    I'm not a dr., but it looks to me like an emergency situation with too much cerebrospinal fluid.

Hopefully my father's conditions improve with the medication he prescribed - he's already doing better but the hallucinations are bothering him a bit.Thanks again!	post_6740813
post_6743922	Mar 17, 2011	1632151	None	None	Thanks again for your help with this. Yes, the neurologist has seen the CT scan slides and the report and had then made his prescription.However, I am also interested in getting a second opinion and that's why I am looking forward to see another Neurologist in a couple of days.I have received your PMs but will go through them in more details right now.Once again, thanks a TON for your assistance.	post_6740813
post_6743951	Mar 17, 2011	875426	1632151	blackystrat	You got the appointment moved from two weeks to two days then?    Hope they will get him in today!    Especially see the most recent private message I sent you, because you may find it very eye opening!I had a cousin who was a child with increased pressure on the brain after contracting Reye's syndrome.    She reportedly was yelling and acting crazy.    Sadly, we lost her 4 days later from that illness.	post_6740813
post_6743975	Mar 17, 2011	1632151	None	None	Yes, it's with another Neurologist because as I said I want to get a second opinion on this. The second checkup with the first Dr is after 2 weeks.I went through your recent private message and it's indeed eye opening.I will surely get in touch with the Neurologist ASAP, if possible tomorrow. Thank you so much for alerting me on this....Very very sorry to hear about your cousin. Hope she is in peace wherever she is now...God Bless	post_6740813

He was able to sit at 10 months, crawled at 12 months and walked at 18 months. He was born with ptosis. At the age of 3 they found he has mild hearing loss, and recently found out he has one kidney smaller than the other. Mentally he is around 20 months old. His blood calcium levels are a bit low so he is getting calcium as well. Does somebody has child with that diagnosis?	post_6799359

So this appears to be non-genetic in that way.95% of natural head growth is done way before age 19... I must turn to the artificial.Is this the manifestation of a not-very-noticeable klinefelter's? i have the general body type (long legs with slightly wider hips... im skinny but have a 33 or 34 waist size) but not the small testes or breast development...that would suck.	post_6502787

post_8097342	Jun 29, 2012	3095707	1642002	momof4girlsandhopefully1boy2	I do.    A few years back, I had ankle surgery and was diagosed then.    Then, this year, my back was hurting bad again and started to see a chiropractor who stated I had this - the hypermobility EI DS.    I was happy to have a second diagnosis plus it was explaining my back issue.    Very recently, I was reading up on it and found that club foot and easy bruising and heredity is an issue with EDS.    Well, I was born with club foot - one foot only.    I was always clumbsy as a child according to my parents and bruised easy then and still do.    My father had weak ankles and the military wouldn't take him.    He taught me how to bend my legs behind my head like he did to entertain family as I was "double jointed" like he was.    Side show type of comedy and yes, it has come in handy.    But, now, at 48 years old, the pains are coming in.    Lumbar back pain; hip pain; joint pain; easy bruising.    (I also had trigger finger a couple years back and had to get a cortisone shot.)    I've lived with this my entire life, am RELIEVED to know it's due to SOMETHING and not just me whining.    The chiropractor didn't help.    I just take Aleve and deal with it.    There ARE some days I'd like to just curl up and cry when it comes to low back and hip pain and I'm climbing stairs.    It hurts so bad.    My upper spine is also not perfectly straight.    Just a touch crooked.    My spine at my neck is straight and not curved as it should be.    My daughter has signs of this as well.    I've broken several bones in the last few years from falls prior to my ankle surgery.    I've just been dealing with this as I'm not sure there's anything you can do about it to permanently stop being in some form of pain.,	post_6730999

Super elastic and velvet like skin easily torn/bruised, hyper mobility, etc. Being male it has always been a bit difficult for others to understand why I was always excused from physical activities in school. It led me to be somewhat ostracized until I found myself later in life. Now in my Mid-Twenties I have found that this only effects my physical being and never how I feel or choose to live.	post_6730999
post_7097606	Jul 26, 2011	1748152	None	brokenwing83,	I have similar symptomology. I have had chronic joint pain which started in my knees at age 12. I would have scored a 9/9 on the Beighteon scale for hypermobility in my 20s now its about a 5/9. I can volitionally dislocate both hips and have frequent subluxations of my upper three ribs. I have five herniated discs and other symptoms that are too numerous to list. I have yet to be diagnosed. Wether it is Ehlers-Danlos type lll or Benign Hypermobility Joint Syndrome (there is medical community confusion on if these are seperate disorders or variants of the same) I don't know and have been unable to get a diagnosis. Seeing a new rheumatologist soon so we will see.I feel for you. I've been were you are. Doctors look at you as if it's all in our heads, however, they don't live in our bodies.With the family history of aortic anerysm you may want to look into the Vascular form of EDS. There are many gradients of symptoms. Some patients have little or no skin involement. It is all variable from person to person.	post_6759253

First of all Angelman is not cureable as of right now...they are working hard on the cure though. And when you sepak of convulsions you mean seizures right? Seizures are common in angelman syndrome. My son is currently on topamax, colanzepam, prednisone, and melatonin. If you look on facebook there is a group called FAST..foundation for angelman syndrome therapeutics...also i started a group for parents of angels so that i could talk to parents with children who have angelman.

She could try taking acidophilous (found in health food stores) and spreading it in her mouth about 3 to 4 times a day. It's a pro-biotic and wouldn't cause and negative side-effects.

post_6774275	Mar 28, 2011	1310468	1646718	2night	If you've just noticed that you gain muscle more easily than your friends, that doesn't necessarily mean a great deal - people simply have different body types that adapt better to different sorts of exercise. My partner, for example, has been going to the gym three times a week for the past year and is now the same size as a friend of ours who's seriously into body-building (including 'roids) and spends fours hours in the gym every single day and has done for several years. My boyfriend just has a body-type better adapted to gaining bulky muscle than our friend, who has to work harder at it; my boyfriend is a classic and pronounced mesomorph, while the friend is probably somewhere between a mesomorph and an ectomorph by nature (google these terms if they're not familiar).Another friend of ours is a former long-distance runner for Great Britain who's very light and lean as you'd expect (a classic ectomorph). He could hit the gym as hard as he liked for years and he'd never get anywhere near the size my partner is - but conversely, my partner could take up marathon training and he'd never be as slender as our friend in a million years.By the same token, my brothers are 6' 1" and 6' 3", and weigh about 225 lbs and 240 lbs respectively. They're not fat and they don't intentionally aim to put on muscle - but both play rugby and put on bulk just in the course of their training. Again, there's no genetic "condition" involved - our parents both come from families of mesopmorphs, and my brothers have inherited the body type. (In case you're wondering, I've inherited this too although in my case there's probably a bit more endomorph in there as you'd expect for a female. I have to be quite careful about what types of exercise I do because I put on muscle far more easily than most women would like to, especially on my legs.)There is a gene (myostatin, or MSTN) that - when mutated or deleted - is known to cause excessive muscling in humans and animals. Myostatin acts to differentiate muscle and restrict its size, and when it doesn't work as it should muscle growth is increased; for an example, google "bully whippet" and compare the images to a standard whippet. In humans the mutation is very rare, and unless you were walking at six months or doing press-ups at 12 months I doubt there's any reason to think your MSTN gene isn't normal - you're probably just a mesomorph in a world of endomorphs, ectomorphs and combination body-types. Just like my boyfriend and my brothers!	post_6772343
post_6775448	Mar 28, 2011	1646718	None	Good answer	That was a good answer Soggymoggy. A lot of of people believe that I have myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy BUT NO !! Actually I have something completly different. I believe it to be the same genetics that 8 time Mr.Olympia Ronnie Colman has and possiblly300 lbs Bobby Lashely. And you're right there is no name for it. And no other information other than it's extremly rare. It's some sort of weird element, it surounds my entire exo-skeleton and it contiues to produce fresh tissue, it's great and an interesting sensation. I can actually go from zero to 275 lbs pure muscle in a week. That's eating something every hour for 6 straight days. There is lots of information availible on myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy, but nothing on what I have. And very few people including doctors know about it.	post_6772343
post_6774819	Mar 28, 2011	1647560	1532927	chichirichi	My daughter was just diagnosed with ACC, though she just turned 11.    We were told by a pediatric dermatologist when she was only a few months old that the small, dime-sized spot on her head was just a cyst.    Last week we were preparing to go through a minor in-office procedure to cover the spot when her new doctor (thank God!) made the correct diagnosis.    We're still going through testing to see how serious hers is -- CT scan is next week.    I've been told if she has a hole in her skull or other abnormalities that we'll be referred to a neurosurgeon, but if it's fine we'll be sent to a plastic surgeon.    Not sure at this point if we'll even look at repair if the important things are ok.    My daughter has always been super-active and is very involved in sports.    I'm eager to find out what's going on so I can again feel comfortable watching her bang into other people on the soccer field and basketball court.You might check out the other posts on this page about ACC -- there are many people who have described the procedures they and their children have gone through to repair their spots.by the way -- I have 4 other children, no symptoms in any of them	post_6447490

post_6657098	Feb 17, 2011	1607035	None	Genetics	I share in your frustration. I have a now four year old who was born early. 5 weeks she was 8'2 and 17 in she came out very dark perhaps stayed in canal too long but was no other signs of any problems. I breastfed but got sick a bit so she had to be on bottle she became violently ill projectile vomiting the Doctors admitted her and tests were done so many test nothing came back why this was happening trying all types of milks even soy nutramagin. Finally I was cleared to begin breastfeeding her again and she stopped. She completely recovered leaving doctors baffled until about 6 months old I noticed she was not developing normal. I startedbaby food and projectile vomitting came back with a vengeance    She was diagnose as failure to thrive    became so ill she spent more time inpainent at Duke diagnosed with this and that then told no that is why sent home overage over with no answers Doctors said they didn't know but keep doing what I was doing. One time there an it saw her and wanted to do a swallow test    turned out she was inhaling food and drink and causing her to develop pneumonia. After hearing that the hematologist told us she had neutropenia which meant no immunity to fight illnesses anytime she gets a fever she must be hospitalized. So if she ate or drank it would turninto pneumonia and after using an antibiotic a body would build immunity to it and eventually be useless    on top of that the geneticist came and told us they found a genetic abnormality a small deletion Chromosome 1q21.1 however they didn't know what it was or y she had it.

I do not presume to understand the complexity of the science, nor the feelings or frustrations of parents like yourself who have to deal with these situations. I just know there IS frustration, because I know people who are facing similar situations and I am simply trying to understand it all as well.I'm sorry that my post did not help you, and that you felt it patronizing; it was not my intent. I simply posted in the hopes that what I have learned about genetics, or the lack thereof, might help others who are looking for answers because I have seen the frustration and know parents that have had to face the lack of information in general.

post_6739822	Mar 16, 2011	1310468	1635527	AKSURESH58	If you've explained the relationship correctly, this woman is your cousin, not your niece.    There IS a significantly higher risk of genetic illnesses in children born of consanguineous marriages than in those born of non-related parents. (Belveccio, I hope you're joking, by the way - smoking is legal, but it is far from safe.)As I guess you know, we all carry two sets of genetic code - one from our mother, and the other from our father. Every individual carries many faulty genes; a few may have arisen spontaneously, but the majority will have come from one of their parents. The reason these faulty genes usually cause no harm is that they are overridden by a healthy copy of the same gene inherited from the other parent. To take a totally arbitrary example, if I inherited a faulty gene causing blindness from my mother, it won't affect me because I also inherited a healthy copy of the same gene from my father, which stops the bad gene from affecting me.HOWEVER... if my brother ALSO inherited the faulty gene from our mother (a 50/50 chance) and then he and I had a child, there's a one-in-four chance that the child would inherit the faulty gene from both of us with no "good" gene to cancel it out, and therefore our child WOULD be affected by the bad gene and would be blind. Conversely, if I had a child with someone unrelated to me the chances of their having the same faulty gene I have would be almost negligible, and therefore there would be almost no chance that our children would be affected.The maths for cousins as opposed to siblings is a bit more complicated, but the risks are still very high compared to the risks you encounter in having children with someone you're not related to. Let's say your grandfather was carrying the gene that causes blindness; both your mother and and your uncle (this woman's father) have a 50/50 chance of carrying this gene too. That means that both you AND your cousin stand a one-in-four chance of carrying the gene, although it does not affect you as you both have healthy copies to cancel it out. HOWEVER... if you and your cousin were to have a child together, that child would have a one-in-sixteen chance of inheriting the faulty gene from both of you - that is, a one-in-sixteen chance of being blind.Now if you consider that every person - everyone - carries dozens if not hundreds of faulty genes, there is a good chance that you and your cousin will have inherited a few of the same ones. If marrying within the family is common in your culture, in fact, and if any of your ancestors were also related to each other, it is likely that you and your cousin will share even more faulty genes. Mathematically, in fact, if the two of you have inherited only eight faulty genes in common (which perfectly possible if not likely)... that's a 50/50 chance for each child that they will have a genetic problem of some sort.Genetic illnesses can range from almost imperceptible to extremely severe and even fatal, but there's no way to tell in advance what sort your child will inherit from you.    If marrying your cousin is legal and would make you both happy then by all means go ahead - but if I were you I don't think I'd be having kids with her. That doesn't mean you can't have kids - you can adopt, or if you'd both be happy with it even use a third party to have children... but there's no doubt that your own biological kids would be a much greater risk of genetic illness than kids born of unrelated parents, and anyone who tries to tell you different or downplay that risk is lying to you.I hope this helps, and best of luck.	post_6736090

post_6684362	Feb 25, 2011	419309	395787	marialou	To answer your question, I have heard of 22q11.2 but have not heard it referred to as Goldberg Shprintzen syndrome.    My limited understanding is that 22q11.2 deletion is usually called DiGeorge or Velo-Cardio-Facial syndrome, and it is estimated to occur as often as 1 in every 2000 births (in the United States), though that may be completely different and separate from Goldberg-Shprintzen.

post_6686974	Feb 26, 2011	419309	395787	marialou	DiGeorge (22q11.2) is fairly well-documented, but like you say, there seems to be much less information out there about Goldberg-Shprintzen (10q22.1, KA1279), which is different and less common than Shrprintzen-Goldberg.I found some good resources and gateways on line that maybe useful:http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/GARD/Condition/9849/GoldbergShprintzen_megacolon_syndrome.aspx/Showall#ResourcesAlso, I don't know where you are exactly in the UK in reference to this doctor, but if you're pursuing info on 10q22.1 as opposed to 22q11.2, you might look him up:Cheshire and Merseyside Medical Genetics ServiceDepartment of Clinical Genetics, Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, UK. ***@****	post_6664746

post_6684372	Feb 25, 2011	419309	1615699	Panrosh	Unusual vaginal bleeding, or heavy menstrual bleeding, is called menorrhagia, and there are many causes that can contribute to unusual or excessive vaginal bleeding.    The most common cause of abnormal menstrual bleeding for pre-menopausal women is fibroids, but causes can be varied, from very benign conditions to serious conditions.If you have concerns for prolonged abnormal bleeding, it is wise to consult with an ob/gyn and perhaps have ultrasound imaging to determine the possible cause.    However, do note that your question is not relevant to genetics, but should be followed up with a gynecologist.Good luck.	post_6678774

post_6646974	Feb 14, 2011	1602836	1531506	Muneca88	I am 28, and I have a small bump on the left side of my vagina lip, on the inside.    I doubt your lump is an STD, it takes more then a couple days for one to show up... usually. I've acutally had my bump for 3 years, and I freaked out when I first noticed it, I thought it was an std.    I have been to my family doctor and he said it wasn't an STD, and he tried to freeze it off, but after 2 months it came back.    My little sis had something similar but more of them, and she has insurance so she went to an actual gyno, I can't remember what they said it was, but it wasn't an std either.    They took a razor blade and sliced the side of each bump and popped a seed out.    I decided to try this, I bought a new package of razor blades, sterilized one in boiling water and rubbed alcohol on it, and cut a small slit in the bump.    Just blood and maybe a little clear liquid came out.. no seed.    BUT it got so much smaller!    Down fall is it's not gone and it does come back.    Good news is when it starts getting bigger I sterilize another new razor blade and try again.    More good news is it's not an STD and what you has sounds like what I've got.. at least so far it does.... Does it hurt?    how big is it?    You should probably go get it checked out by a doctor if you haven't already... but an alternative is the remedy I've been doing. It's been about a year and a half since I started doing this, maybe once a month I'll drain it myself. I think it is a cyst it just never gets big because it drains. I told the doctor what I do to keep it drained and he just said as long as I'm clean about it, clean hands, clean razor and what not, that doing this myslef should be fine.    I'll go to a gyno when I have money.    Did you ever see a doctor about yours?    What did they say?    Do you still have it?	post_6442912
post_6604417	Feb 01, 2011	1429890	None	None	Going back to the different clinic/hospital at the end of the month. Going to talk to the genetic counselor, do the ultrasound, and talk to the doctor again. My doctors at the place I do my regular doctor appointments at don't seem to know what they are talking about. There is no cyst in the baby's brain. We all have two parts of the brain. A right and a left. One side of the baby's brain is bigger and has excessive fluid in it then the other. When I had the ultrasound at my regular doc's the level was a 9. When I had ultrasound yesterday the level was a 11. If it gets higher than where its at, it causes PROBLEMS! Thats the only thing that doesn't look right on the ultrasound. The doctor doesn't think its spina bifa cause everything else on the ultrasound looks good. I had to get blood work done ( one to check for infection and another one to check plateletes...if the doctors don't like the results of the next appointment than my boyfriend is going to have to get his blood drawn as well ).	post_6589416

post_6570999	Jan 22, 2011	1227139	1557279	hello1965	Dear Hello1965,The short answer to your question is NO.    A Father who has a blood type of A+ and a mother with O+ must have either a child with: A or O.And further a child with a B+ with who has a Mother with O+ blood type can only come from a father who must have: B or AB.    No exceptions except the Rh factor (which refers to negative and positive).I have provided a reference site here for you to see or use, (a blood type calculator/chart which is used by our Canadian Government for paternity issues in Family court) -http://www.canadiancrc.com/Paternity_determination_blood_type.aspxI hope this helps to shed some light on your question.    If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to message me directly.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6528074
post_6533357	Jan 10, 2011	1558978	1557529	cdc29	Hello cdc29,Just reading your question with regards to blood type. If the father is O pos and the the mother is A pos you can NOT produce an offspring that is B neg. Here is why, we will deal with the blood groups and leave out the Rh factor for simplicity (will explain that after).As parents we each donate half of our genetic make to our children so for example the father is blood group O so he carries 2 gene's OO so he can only donate a O to his off spring but the mother is group A so she could be AO, or AA but nothing else so she could donate either a A or an O to her offspring. So the only possible blood type for there child would be OO= group O or AO= group A. So it is impossible to give birth to a child that has a group B. There are only 6 possible blood types (Rh asside for now).You can have OO, AO, AA, BO, BB, AB. (Think of the O as being nothing meaning no antigens on the Red blood Cells).Rh factor is a bit different and they use a big D and a little d to represent the Rh factor so if you have D say from your father and a little d from your mother (your child would be Dd) in which case you would have an Rh factor of being positive where as if you have both little dd's you would be considered Rh negative (this is a recessive trait).So in closing the only way to have a B neg child is the mother would have had to be an AO (Rh Dd = pos) and the father would have been either a BO, BB, AB (Rh Dd= pos). The mother would pass on an O (Rh-d) and the father would have to pass on a B (Rh-d) to give you the blood type BO (Rh-neg). Any time you have a A or B with an O it is always going to be that letter (A or B group that is dominate as I said previous the O is not having nothing on your Red Blood Cells).Hope I didn't confuse you to much.Medlabtech12	post_6528803
post_6533375	Jan 10, 2011	1558978	1557529	cdc29	Oh one more thing is if the parent is AB they could donate either a group A or B but that would mean that there blood group would be AB not just group A or group B.Group O (especially O neg are the universal donators) can donate to anyone because they carry no antigens on the red blood cells.Where as group AB is the universal acceptor they can have any blood because they have both antigen on the red blood cells and won't have a transfusion reaction.They give women of child bearing age O neg so that they don't develope a antibody to the Rh factor.	post_6528803
post_6570991	Jan 22, 2011	1227139	1557529	cdc29	Hello Cdc29,I have not much further to add (since the above explanation is very specific) except to mention a great site for you to see which has blood type calculator/chart as well as a simple but concise explanation regarding how the outcomes are possible.    The site was constructed to assist with court and paternity questions.See here:    http://www.canadiancrc.com/Paternity_determination_blood_type.aspxIn short the answer to your question (from the chart I have provided) Generally for a child to have B, with a mother who is A, the father must be B or AB.    (I have not including the negative factor (Rh) - which is explained further down in the chart from the link I provided)I hope this helps.

post_6560376	Jan 19, 2011	1227139	1567319	Mickey7998	Hello Mickey7998,I am sorry to hear you are having so much stress right now in your pregnancy.    Firstly, yes it would have been too early to have an accurate measurement.    I have a great deal of information regarding NT (Nuchal translucency) measurements from education but primarily because I have a son with Down syndrome and also do a lot of support work and advocacy for Ds.    The appropriate time for an accurate measurement is between 11-14 weeks and the prime time is usually 12 weeks.    Before 11 weeks, the area behind the neck (which is where the Nuchal fold and fluid is) is usually very small and a comparative analysis regarding measurement can't be made accurately.    There are guidelines that must be followed when taking a NT measurement and usually only trained ultrasound technicians or doctors take this measurement.    There are formula which are used and also once the measurement is taken that specific result is usually correlated with other screening such as blood testing in order to arrive at whether there is a risk for certain types of abnormalities.    There are many potential concerns that can be screened for such as Down syndrome, Neural tube defects (such as Spina Bifida) and other Trisomy's or chromosomal abnormalities.    ALSO it is important to know that as well as identifying possible risks for those medical issues, it can also mean nothing at all.    There are instances where a measurement higher then the area's normal range (which does differer area to area, country to country) can mean nothing at all.    Likewise, a normal measurement can also occur even if you have a child born with one of those diagnoses.    (My son who has Down syndrome had a normal measurement, as did many of my friends who also have children with Down syndrome.)    So, it is very important that you do not rely on a NT measurement alone to determine if there is a problem.    Usually, if there is a measurement outside of the normal range, the protocol is to refer the person for further screening or testing which can confirm a diagnosis.    I urge you to explore that before considering termination, and to also do reserach on the specific medical issues that you are potentially facing.    It isn't all cases, but my example for you would be to take a look at my personal blog which shows the life of my son, who is very typical despite his diagnosis of Down syndrome.But in the mean time, if you would like some more or further information I would be glad to provide it to you.    I do know first hand how stressful receiving information like this can be, and not knowing anything about it can cause much more stress.    Please feel free to send me a message, and I would be happy to help answer any further questions.    I am sure you must have more.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6559373
post_6568995	Jan 21, 2011	1563242	None	None	I am so very sorry that you are going through this. I went through pretty much the same thing. Are you sure the doctor said Andrew sydrome? I am afraid from what you described(baby passing away shortly after birth) it was EDward's syndrome (trisomy 18)? Dragon1973 is right, nt defects are very common in all of the trisomies. Most common of them are DS(trisomy21), EDwards(t18), Turner's(t13). The trisomy 18 foundation at trisomy18.org is a good place to look for information, as well as SOFT(t18/13). I used both when my son was found to have t18. Like she said, it may also not related to a chromosome anamoly. My best advice, educate & prepare yourself for what may come. There are living children with t18. The more informed and educated you are will help you make the right decision for you. Feel free to contact me.	post_6559373

post_6396809	Nov 27, 2010	1227139	1515406	mommy2girls29	Hello Mommy2girls29,    (sorry in advance if this is long)For your age, your maternal risk (if under 35, and not knowing your exact age) would be less then 1:350 for Down syndrome (see reference here:    http://www.ds-health.com/risk.htm)    I used the age of 35 which shows 1:350.    This is from the Ds Health site.    But this can differ by location as my risk odds were 1:385 at the age of 35 in Canada.But I had done a little bit of research on this very topic with identical twins and the possibility of one twin having Ds and the other not (in the case of mono/mono) is not possible since genetically they are supposed to be the same.    In mono di twins, (who share the same placenta but separate amniotic sacs) they are said to be genetically similar, so I presume the possibility is there.    If the twins were fraternal, then it is very possible to have one with Ds and one without.    I have only read one case where the twins were identical and one had Ds and the other did not.    I don't know the credibility of that medical journal article I read though.    The point is, understanding how Ds occurs can give you a bit of insight.    When Ds is random (as 97% of cases are) the chromosomes fail to separate properly by instruction from either the mother or the fathers 21st chromosome and passes the baby a pair instead of only one copy resulting in a set of the 21st chromosome.    (Each baby should have 23 pairs resulting in 46 total, but when Ds occurs, there are 47 because the 21st has three instead of two.)When doctors look for soft markers to help them identify if further testing is required for chromosomal abnormalities, the discovery of markers can signify that there is a greater potential for discovery of an abnormality but equally can mean nothing at all as some markers exist in foetuses who have no chromosomal abnormalities.    The appearance of one or even two soft markers do not necessarily mean that the baby has any chromosomal problems.    Sometimes markers can signify nothing, but the fact remains doctors look for these because specific markers do tend to appear more often in babies with certain chromosomal problems.    When a marker is discovered, often they might suggest further screening or testing.    This is protocol (depending on where you are) for the recommendation for further testing.    It also helps them to redefine your maternal odds or risks for the chromosomal abnormalities that are most often screened for such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), Trisomy 13 and or 18.I do have a comprehensive list of markers and characteristics that I can send to you if you wish.    But please keep in mind that just as having markers can mean absolutely nothing at all with respect to Ds, the absence of markers (the opposite) is also true.    Many babies who didn't show markers on screening or ultrasound can also have Down syndrome.    It is important that you understand both sides if you wish to have the list.    I also use the example that percentages, numbers and statistics should always be thought of as they are.    Just numbers.    However to add, the only way anyone can know for sure whether a baby has a chromosomal abnormality is not through screening (though helpful to ***** risk) but through definitive testing such as Amniocentesis, CVS or PUBS.I hope this helps you and if you wish to have the list that I have of markers for your own reference, please do let me know - via personal message.    It is a bit too long to enter into a post or comment.    If you have other questions I am happy to help.In addition to anything I have mentioned, please keep in mind, that while I or others may have extensive knowledge in many areas, you should always seek professional medical advice from your own physician, as it pertains to medical conditions or concerns.Good luck, and if you have any other questions that I can help you with, please feel free to message me directly.Sincerely,Sandi (Dragon1973)MedHelp Genetics Community Leader;Children - Special Needs Community Leader;Down syndrome Community Leader & Ds Group Forum Founder/Moderator;MTHFR Group Forum Founder/Moderator;Pregnancy: June 2011 Community Leader	post_6391000

post_6464836	Dec 18, 2010	1533128	None	None	I know doctors don't want to remove an organ if its not absolutely necessary.    I also have family members that have delt with medical problems that I am just starting to see.    Eventhough, i'm predisposed to getting Diabetes because of genes, I still have not gotten it.    That doesn't mean I won't.    It seems like they won't do anything until it breaks completely.    you know somethings not right, way before the test show it. It makes since to spare you the pain once the test show that you're going down the same road as your relatives.    Some Dr.'s are good at making these decisions based on Quality of life issues.    In their mind, you don't take it out until its broken.    In my mind, once its broken it is too late.    Why not prevent future damage to other vulnerable organs and make life more comfortable.    I guess there is a financial motivation to strech it out as long as possible. (Not that all Dr.'s do this, but it is possible) (It's kind of like job security)    I really do believe that most Dr.'s really want to help and make things better.    There are complications when removing organs and things don't always work out the way they are supposed to.	post_6463779

post_6434706	Dec 08, 2010	419309	1526117	Pntnbtr	Because multiple generations in the family are exhibiting similar health problems, it may be worthwhile for you and your family to be seen by a medical geneticist.    I'm sorry I don't have any particular knowledge about what might be affecting you and your family, but with three generations showing similar symptoms of serious medical issues, it might be useful for your physician to refer you and your family to seek genetic evaluation.    Good luck.	post_6424186

Hope that helps.	post_6432116

There are growth plates at the ends of bones. Doctors can look at them to see if they are done growing or not. They can also look at you hip bones and they grow in a way that shows if you are done growing risser sign i believe is what it is called.I am actually 5' 9 1/5" also...lol.     I couldnt imagine getting much taller!    I already have to bend over to do everything, I imagine you know what I mean.If you keep growing, and at a fast pace I would ask your doctor if it is abnormal. There are things that can make you keep growing like hormonal imbalances, and can be fixed with the right treatments.    So just keep track of it for now, and if you feel like it isnt normal    make sure you get to the doctor and they will make sure it isnt abnormal.Try not to worry about it too much, enjoy being young while you still are.

I dont remember the particular gene but it can both be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive. So if she has the dominant form that would give you 50-25% risk or else there risk is probably 0%. Since you dont have the defect gene. From what I read it sounds like an autosomal recessive form, so nothing to worry about.But at least get it checked! Good luck.	post_6392652

post_7323471	Oct 14, 2011	None	1287446	pearjas	Hi there!The radiologist has described a motion artifact i.e. the images were not clear do to movement of the patient during the imaging procedure. However the study describes a few other changes that may be normal with increased age and some small areas of infarcts (minute areas of dead tissue due to lack f adequate blood supply) probably secondary to small vessel disease. This is the same pathology as a stroke except that in the latter the infarcts would involve larger areas and the symptoms would tend to be more acute. I would suggest consulting a neurologist/ his treating physician for adequate management of the condition which may involve medications and lifestyle changes along with adequate control of a few conditions such as hypertension, if involved.Hope this is useful.Take care!	post_7190828

What's more, the researchers found that every micromolar rise in the inflammation marker homocysteine upped Alzheimer's risk by 16 percent.Since B12 is known to lower those homocysteine levels the answer here: Steak, steak and more steak, because it's loaded with the stuff.Just make sure you serve them so rare, because well-done steaks can actually boost those homocysteine levels.This isn't the first study to find that B vitamins can beat Alzheimer'sresearchers have even found that those three Bs can actually stop your brain from shrinking, a key risk factor for dementia.	post_7252205

It is a misery that they are in this way and we along with them to witness it in such a direct way. Trully sad.What i need to say    here only to make clear of where the situation is just so i can gage my mothers stage in relation perhaps to you is that there are some differences.When i say that i feed her, i mean i cook, but she uses her own fork to pass food in her mouth. I do help someitmes to get the food on her fork. So she is not yet feeding form a tube. she is chewing and swallowing.I help bathe her. as in i lift her up form the tub. but for now she gets out of bed on her own and she walks.she is constantly confused though and sleeps loads and has lost weight. she eats only a little bit every day.You say you are an only child too.

post_7258205	Sep 21, 2011	212161	1761778	liddy9	goodmorning.    to answer your questionswe did have home health care coming in and helping me and my dad out for a while the county can set that up for you, see what your state has to offer. we got it when my mom went into the hospital with a uti and they set it up for us. so check with state or even the center she goes to maybe they can help you with that.now we have hospica because the home health care can only help you if you are inporoving, but my mom will never walk again so there is no inproving so they sent hospica in.thats a state thing to county thing so they are now on board. they will come in and bathe her and help with her care. but astill not the same as having a full time caretaker, but they cost so much.plz check your insurane    and see what plan your mom is on as far as her medicare, if plan a hospica will do it and not charge. other words if your mom has worked enought to get social sercurty than she should be able to get on plan A    and hospica will not be a problem to start. my mom never worked so we are having to get her on it and its not been easy and is costing us 200.00 a day for hospica until shes approved.i do work part time so when am at work my dad is here and when he works am here , we trade off, not easy but we do it .we never plan to put her into a home. we want to keep her close to us so we can help her throught her end of life. we have signed a dnr which means dont bring her back if her heart stop beating, so she will never go to a hospital again, its very very hard to sigh that but like they told us, you will be bringing her back to suffer some more .its a lot to take in girl, take it a day at a time. prayers are with you and your mother . hugs	post_7252205

post_7260706	Sep 21, 2011	1530171	None	To All	Hey Everyone.My mom is    physically challenged and placed    recently in a nursing home because of a drunk driver.She suffered multiple bone fractures and head injuries.She was bed-ridden for 6 months and    eventually became depressed.Now she's on a wheelchair and diagnosed with    early onset dementiadue to the brain injury she sustained.I understand    very well what many of you are going through.Some tips that may help :Assimilation is the key in    nutrition and supplementation.You are what you absorb and assimilate, not what you eat!We can all talk about the value of B12 supplementation and eating steaks, however, we need to understand that in elderly patients, the majority of them have compromised and inefficiently functioning digestive and G.I systems.When levels are low, because of costs, inferior quality injectable Cyanocobalamin is commonly    prescribed, instead of Methylocobalamin or Hydroxylocobalamin, which are superior and safer (and more expensive).An article,     in the Journal of Bacteriology, a peer-reviewed journal, called "Sterol Requirements of T-strain Mycoplasmas" by Rodham, Fend & Hayflick describes    how mycoplasma, a particle of bacterial DNA, has no body of its own and ordinarily it does no harm. However, if you have some kind of trauma, then the mycoplasma comes to life, starts to take apart the cell it lives in sterol by sterol, and it kills the host cell. That's called degeneration. One of the mycoplasma diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's or Parkinson's or fibromyalgia will begin to present.The people who get affected, have a genetic predisposition to this.One thing that prevents this is Coconut Oil.When glucose supply    to the brain is inhibited, coconut oil is able to cross    the blood -brain barrier and supply much needed fuel to the brain.If you have not read the book :Stop Alzheimer's Now!: How to Prevent & Reverse Dementia, Parkinson's, ALS, Multiple Sclerosis & Other Neurodegenerative Disorders.    by Dr. Bruce Fife,I suggest you consider reading it asap!I have been consuming extra virgin coconut oil for years, and I must confess that this has contributed greatly to my wellness,    good healthand mental acuity. My oral health is also excellent as I do daily "oil pulling" with EVCO. Just do a search for it.The a.c.v is something I take for many things, however, I did    not know it is very good for memory. Thanks for the tip! I use the raw organic with the"mother" in it. It has helped my dad with his arthritis tremendously.Take care Everyone!Blessings to all!Nikodicreta	post_7252205

Mine died nearly three years ago so this is the cause of my mums down fall.She hasnt worked ever but has a private insurance luckily i did that for her recently but it only covers hospital and big eaminations..Im still confused as to wether its some huge depression or dementia. I reduced her take of Risperidone and two nights now she didnt have a problem with going to the toilet and hasnt wet the bed. Seems more clear headed. Perhaps some of these pills are just rubbish. As in they might help one things but cause damage in the rest. I'm thouroughly confused myself. she seems clear today. slow - as always -but clear. no hovering.I live in Greece its a run down country speacially at the moment, so we dont have significant help. No one will come and bath her.. Best option is to find a home care person from Russia who needs housing and that way helps both ways. Those are actually the kindest people and cheapest.Hope you have had a good day.best to you,Isabelle	post_7252205
post_7261339	Sep 22, 2011	1530171	1761778	liddy9	Yia Sou Isabelle. Hmm, Interesting we crossed paths here!We have for my mom an "Apokllistiki" lady for half a day, 6 days a weekfor 400 Euros plus "Dora" for Easter, Summer and Xmas.She gets bathed and dressed, her hair groomed, walks (on her wheelchair)and help with her meals. For the balance of the time the staff there is very good.I just returned two weeks ago from there, as I live in Canada.Coconut oil over 22 Celcius , liquifies, so it may be the same thing,just at different temperatures.I bought mine 2 years ago in Greece from Gaia, a health food store.Extra Virgin Organic is the one to buy. This summer I brought some fromCanada, as I use a lot of it (and I really like mine!).My best suggestion for your situation with your mom, is to keep working on yourself. When you are grounded , centered and your consciousness is raised higher, it will make a world of difference. Your mom will feel it and it will influence her in many ways, (not necessarily conscious or obvious    right away). Accepting her condition is very important, recognizing    also the contribution you can make for her and others in this world .Blessings,Nikodicreta	post_7252205

So sorry that you and your family are dealing with this.I'm sure there will be people more able to help you on this forum but I just felt I needed to respond as well. This is the most devastating disease I have come across.My father in law died with it & now my grandmother has it.Anyway,please don't be angry with your father.In saying that, I know your anger-been there done that. Your dad just thinks he's protecting her. is there a way you could get him to go to a support group? That may help him to see this disease from a different angle. Another question I have is that the Dr.said your mother was at the end stage of alzhemers? I'm not a Dr. nor do I know your mother but she doesn't sound anything like the end stages. How long has she been on aricept. I have just found that most Drs don't know alot about this disease & just throw terms around. I wish I could be of more help to you.If you just need a sounding board I'll listen & help where I can. Takecare!	post_7229137

I was just scared that she was not getting the help she needed and to hear you all say it is fine what my father has chosen to do or not do is ok has helped me alot. Her internist and neuro both said she is in end stage as well as the doctor in the emergency room. She still goes to the restroom on her own and can walk and is lucid alot of the time. She has forgotten my name but knows that I am her daughter and she does not know what day it is, ect.

No,you are absolutely NOT being selfish! Doesn't even matter what your family history is-you have a full life ahead of you & you should grab whatever life has to offer you. This is not a fair disease & it isn't fair that anyone should have to take care of your grandmother but sounds like there are other options in your family.    Now, stepping outside of the dementia issues-please don't think that you will find happiness for yourself by simply moving-that's just geography.I have yet to ever hear of a person finding happiness by moving alone! & if you are going to drag some guilt with you you could quite possibly end up more miserable.Happiness is within yourself.        Please do what YOU need to do & if that means moving then that's what you do. Your sister will need little breaks from time to time so maybe you could come home & help her a couple times of year. I hope this helps a little & if there is anything else I could do or just lend an ear-please don't hesitate.     Take care!        "P"	post_7213353

I do not forget the meaning of words, but I do use some interchangeably (like your example of table and chair--If someone asked if you were going to sit on the table, would you have known that was wrong?)    i will say Thanskgiving when i mean Christmas, football when I mean basketball, gazelle when i mean deer.    i don't usually notice when i do that, and i get annoyed when my husband points it out - he knows what i meant.    i have done this since my cardiac arrest 13 years ago	post_7198650

My reference to going to court is that I could go before the courts and get her declared incapable of taking care of herself.The Dr. isn't much help at all-he is if the opionion that if I wait long enough eventually she won't know where I put her.& yes,I could have Home Care come in and do alot of things but my grandmother refuses-even them coming in to give her meds was an absolute fight for a couple of months.I am somewhat disabled dealing with a broken leg that went wrong & probably am looking at a 4th surgery but my grandmothers thought is that I have nothing else to do since my kids are 18&20 & I don't work-so, while she refuses to allow me to bathe her I go over to wash&set    her hair & keep the filth in her condo to a minimum. My grandmother has always been a independant woman who relied on no one ever-she raised my mom by herself in the days that it wasn't heard of-she got an educatiion worked hard so that they could have a comfortable life & actually ended up quite well off.In the last several years she mortgaged her condo & by the time I took over her finances she had NO money in her account. I have no idea who she gave the money to but have been able to build up her bank account quite a bit.I opened another bank account @ another institution (that she doesnt know about)& have kept the bigger part of her money in there but I can't wipe out the account that she has access to.    While people know that there is something wrong with her she fakes it pretty well therefore no one is too alarmed.Even her own sister(who I suspect of taking her money)believes whatever outlandish story she comes up with,including that I take her money. My Mom is a great support but lives in theU.S. so is limited to what she can do & quite honestly I don't tell her everything so I don't upset her as she feels so guilty that I am having to deal w/this.She comes here for a month but my Dad is aged &not well either. I am so sorry for rambeling I just feel so trapped sometimes & don't want to always be a "DOWNER" to everyone around me! Lucky you! Ha!    Thanks for taking the time with me-wish I could give you a hug of appreciation.& thanks for your prayers as well you don't know how much this means to me. If I can be a sounding board at anytime I'm here as well.    Take Care!        "P"	post_7162344

post_7192833	Aug 29, 2011	1219485	None	None	Hi Barbara! Once again,thank you so much for your kind words and prayers-Know you have been in mine as well!- I know it is somewhat sick to say but, somehow it takes a bit of a load off knowing someone is in the same boat with me. I guess like the saying goes ;"misery loves company" In saying that I am also so sad for you, I can't imagine if I was dealing with my mother & this terrible disease don't get me wrong, I love my Nana but my mom raised me-my whole life is wrapped up in her & yet you don't sound bitter, or resentful. I get so resentful at times & feel terrible for feeling that way but it's like I'm taking care of a complete stranger.It isn't Nana anymore-there is nothing left of her & I think thats why I get mad.I don't know Barbara,this is a learning process.I always try to find silver linings but this is a hard one-maybe someday I can help someone else?     Anyway, you take care & stay in touch. God bless you & your family!    "P"	post_7162344

I'm always nervous about my Nana getting some sort of infection as her baths are so few and far between.        I feel so bad because unlike you, I can't see ANYTHING in Nana that is her.I keep telling myself that I'm protecting myself but I just don't know. I have done my mourning for her already & while I do love the lady that I help, it isn't the same love I had for Nana. I have alot of guilt over my feelings but I can't help the way I feel. This is just such a cruel disease!    I hope you and yours are doing well & had a good long weekend. you are in my thoughts! :)        "P"	post_7162344

The use of hormone replacement therapies to treat the menopausal symptoms of    women in their 60s or 70s has also been shown to possibly lead to cognitive decline.	post_7188799

Plooz so sorry your having these problems.    first why did you have the mri, does this run in your family?     there are more test out there that can help you see if you have a chance of having it .    they can check the two genes that most have and now they have a spine test that they say is very good .if the Dr is telling you this than has the dr offered the meds to slow it down. or told you what you need to do to slow it down ?Dr's are great dont get me wrong but it will take more than one test to say your going have that. most the time they cant tell you and its a guessing game . hang in there try not stress self . go see another dr get a second and see what they say. stay in touch.	post_7147517

post_6983618	Jun 13, 2011	None	None	None	ok does alz run in your family and did you ask the dr if that could be it ?i have found out since my mom has it that not all forgetting is bad, am 51 and do a lot of what you say, but i have learn that if you do recall it later than its not alz its just bad memory, thats what dr oz says and a study.the more up-set you get about it the more you will forget. belive me i do it. than i go months and forget nothing. so it can be just that your so concern about it that your making yourself worse. like anxiety, if you think about it ,it gets worse until you bring yourself out of it.try and relax and next time you forget, dont get up-set try and be calm and it will come back to you .	post_6982759
post_6986093	Jun 14, 2011	1706802	1690048	pca3055	Please don't freak out, if your neurologist has told you that you have a mild cognitive impairment already then take it as it is. if you want to keep testing yourself you can download a mini mental status exam off the internet. This is what all the professionals use. Have a family member do it for you. You answer a series of questions, draw a diagram that kind of thing. Try to look up your family history, Alzheimers is hereditary and there are medications you can take that can slow the process. Unfortunately things like memory games, cross words and sudoku's only work for a short time until your brain gets used to them. Find another neurologist if you are not satisfied with your current one. Good Luck	post_6982759

post_7019748	Jun 26, 2011	1690048	None	Nickodicreta	Thank you for your advise and concern. I am awfull busy and do not have time for much. I would love to work part time but finances do not allow this. I really do not even know how to meditate. I am always in a hurry and some tmes it is hard to sit still.I also have a diagnosis of Bipolar and take meds for that. I have been stable for years though. Some of this memory oss may be coming from the meds for that. It is still scary when you can not remember something you may have just done or looked at. You give good advise though and I will heed your woords. I am a Christian which helps me to have some faith but the future is scary. My parents died in their 60's and I do not know if they would of had a tendency for ALZ. Thank you again for your thoughts. Have a blessed day everyone.pca3055	post_6982759

post_6959526	Jun 03, 2011	144586	None	None	First of all, do not assume she has Alzheimer's. There are many forms of dementia.Secondly, simple forgetfullness is not necessarily a reason not to drive.If, in your judgement, she is a danger to others, then you are morally obligated to notify the motor vehicles department by registered mail. The general drill in most states is for them to suspend the licence until the individual comes in for another road test, at which time a professional will make the evaluation.	post_6958844
post_6960998	Jun 04, 2011	762700	None	None	Thanks for your reply!    She is more than just forgetful.    The doctor diagnosed her when she made repeated appointments with him over the course of two weeks or more and complained about the same things.    She had no recollection of even being there or what he said.    If she is out of her environment she becomes very agitated and anxious.    When I ask her what she did today she will ask my dad what she did and then repeat what he says.    He is a volunteer at our local hospital and he goes in one day a week.    She will call me repeatedly and ask where he is.    He started leaving her notes so she would know where he was and notes on how to use the phone and what his phone number is.    She will tell me stories and say things happened to her that really happened to me or others.    She watches a lot of TV and gets very worried and obsessed about things she hears and sees.    If she sees the weather calls for flooding somewhere in the country she will insist it is for us.    These are just a few examples of behaviors I see, there are many others.    With that being said she can sometimes carry on a very normal conversation, other times she repeats herself over and over or asks the same questions over and over.I just can't get a handle on what her problem is.        Like I said the only diagnosis we have is what our family doctor said 3 years ago and she has been on (sp) namenda(?) ever since.    I cannot get my dad to take her to anyone else.    He truly thinks if she stays active and independant she will get better.I do not know how to get a good converstaion going with him.    I would just like a real good check up and diagnosis for her but maybe I am asking too much.    I just want her to be happy and healthy as long as possible,	post_6958844
post_6967607	Jun 07, 2011	1219485	None	None	I so know how you feel.I went through the same thing with my Grandmother but thankfully,I talked her out of driving.However,looking into it I found out (well,here in Canada anyway)that when you go to renew you drivers there is a question about ones mental status & if it is documented & you were to have an accident there would be a question of having insurance coverage.I know it is a terrible position to be in but I don't think I could have lived with myself if she would have had an accident & hurt someone or herself.-not    mention the legal and financial ramifications.-This whole thing stinks I know,we only want them to be happy and have the best quality of life they can,but sometimes it has to be head over heart.Good luck to you!	post_6958844

He is nin denial and I guess it is time for me to press him harder.    It is just tough, and I know all of you know (probably better than me because my Mom is not as far along as some).    I really want her to get in and have a FULL diagnosis by a specialist rather than just our family doctor's diagnosis.    I know he really knows her medical history and all but I think a full evaluation is needed.    I need to get Dad on board.    He is taking this all on himself and not letting me help and trying to do it alone.    He thinks if she would just exercise this would all go away......I will keep plugging along and reading everyone's posts and ideas sure does help..Thanks again!	post_6958844

post_6941921	May 28, 2011	1690660	1662361	meljean816	Hi,I saw your post & there are definately meds out there to help her mood swings, & violent outburts.    I lived with & took care of my mom for 7 yrs till she died, & she had Alzheimers & Emphysema. It always started to get worse late in the afternoon.The real key for me was to put her on the right meds, they have a patch now, that evenly distributes all the medication all day.    People left untreted with Alzheimers    what their loved ones don't know that the person becomes delusiona at timesl. So my mom used seroquel & an anti depressant plus the alzheimer meds, but you or your mom should dispense them. Don't let her do it.There are great resources out there for info at the Alheimers Org, & some caregiver books, that tell you how to deal with specific situations.I was lucky enough to have a a contact who directed me to the Wein Insitute (miami) part of Mt. Sinaii and that's all they specialize in.    They spent 8 hrs testing her, along with an MRI.But she always knew me was kind and loving & I miss her so. It's the one really good thing I've done.But it's really hard. I can't emphathize that enough, it's so hard on the caregiver. Over 50% of people over 80 have some form of demiata or alzheimers.It's so nice you are so concerned for your own mom and care enough to write.Take care, hope I helped a little bit	post_6941873

She calls me by my name then she don't know who I am then she calls me my mom or some lady or that i am a baby. she also wants to go to L.A or Kansas. lol.Im in a small town    in California.shes on meds for her heart and her blood pressure and then some kind of vitamin, and her diabetes med. then xanx every six hours. which helps from 6 am to 2:30 pm then no matter what she has meds or when she was in the hospital last month sedation she gets mad and violent and worse just between 3 pm to 9 pm.We have been doing her pills for two years now, when she went into the hospital of an over dose because she couldn't remember her pills.My grandmother has no lucid moments to be on an Alzheimer me because of her dementia which is a different form of Alzheimer. the med she was on for it made her sick and did not help. Shes at the last stages where we have to help her do a lot of stuff for her.I am sorry about your mom. Thank you for responding to my postmelissa	post_6941873

Serequeal was such a big help with calming my my down, & I know from other people I've met that the violent behavior goes with the territory. I do know that there is day care (free if not really cheap M-Sat) at Catholic Charities, & you don't have to be Catholic. That was a lifesaver since I also worked. The Alzheimers organiztion also has volunteers that will come in a few hrs a day for respite care, just for relief, If you call & ck it out in your area.As for the her skin & the patch the meds com in pill form yjats what my momm took. You have a lot of courage, I wish I could help, your not aloneNicky.	post_6941873

The dr called and told us to give her xanx every 4 hours because its such a low dose.    She also has congestive heart failure so she cant take a lot of meds. I love her but sometimes I just wanna run far far away. But no one helps me and my mom. My aunt is helping but she goes back to her home in 3 weeks and we are hoping she will move here in California where I live from Idaho. Thanks we try really hard.	post_6941873

post_6946972	May 30, 2011	1662361	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	hi,Thanks for your response. It is hard my friends wonder why I am so stressed out and they go oh well dont take any of this to heart. You try because you know its not her telling you this its the disease but man some days i just wanna shake her lol.My mom has talked to her DR about her what he calls psychotic episodes. But because of her heart we cant give her anything stronger then.25 mg of xanx. When shes on anything else she is sleepy all the time and we cant get her to eat and she gets violent. more then she is.Last night she wanted to know who could get her and my grandpa out of this place (her house) because me and my aunt where abusing her. the thing her mind comes up with just i have to laugh. Like she wanted to know what would happen if she burnt down the house. or she tells my grandpa shes gets a divorce because he wont help her. I was cooking some stuff and she took the prongs i had sitting on the side of the stove and asked me if she could stab me with them and im like no. She even starts packing up her stuff in random places she stuffed a bunch of things in a magazine rack. But that only happens from 3pm to 9 pm. She is fine and understands things in the morningWed at 3 a social worker is coming to see what they can do with her. Her dr doesnt think she will be able to stay home because she is refusing our help. And almost trying to hurt her self and my grandma and us because she is unhappy.I try but i don't have a    lot of time I go to online college and I wish i could take a break but she needs like 4 people around her at all times.ThanksMelissa	post_6941873
post_6948864	May 31, 2011	212161	None	None	oh as i read your words they fit right into my own story.     yes its very very hard to take care of a love one who does not know you sometimes and that says very hurtfull things to you , but yes your friends are right its not her talking. my mom has wished death on me to and it hurts but i know how sweet my mom is and what kind of person she is and that person who just said that is not my mom.when my mom comes back to herself shes so sad sometimes because she knows she said something but not sure what because my dad gets mad at her and wont talk to her, hes 77 and having a hard time with it, i tell him its not the woman he married 56 years ago but its hard to understand she looks the same so why is she doing him that way. hes getting better at it now but there are days he just cant take it and blows up.plz let me know how the social worker did and what they are going to do for ya.	post_6941873
post_6954317	Jun 01, 2011	1662361	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	The social worker wants us to talk to the family lawyer and get stuff in order. We are going interview some in home care helpers so they can come in and give us breaks. We are looking into me and my aunt getting paid to take care of them. We both basically stopped our life's.    The dr gave her serqial or whatever its called, it mellows her out but I need sleep I haven't had sleep in a month lol. I am also going to school and i can see my grades like dropping.    They worry about us getting the care giver burn out which I feel. This just *****. I am 23 years old, I should be like I dont know getting married? or finishing college and finding my life but instead I spend 5 to 10 hours a day making sure my grandmother doesnt hurt her self.	post_6941873
post_6941877	May 28, 2011	1662361	1219485	PedroH	Hi.My grandmother is going threw the same thing. Altho now she cant remember a number to call so I am around her 24 hours a day if my mom cant.    All I can tell you is that she means nothing she says even if it hurts or is frustrating. Dont show her your mad or getting frustrated because that can make her moods worse. Its hard, I know I go threw it all day i even get hit some times and its draining i know.    also maybe look into getting a nurse to help you out. It is so much better when you have someone to help you out for a few hours.	post_6941163
post_6943569	May 28, 2011	1219485	1662361	meljean816	Thanks so much for your response. I do have home care coming in once a day as well as going there myself,as well as doing her shopping,paying bills,taking her to appts etc...There is no one else to do it & I'm fast burning out & funny how the people in the family that are of no help are always so critical.-Sorry-just venting- Anyway,I am just feeling that she is really not safe staying by herself anymore,she refuses to live with me & I don't know how to convince her to go to assisted living Any suggestions?        Bless you for taking on what you have with your grandmother,you are too young to have to deal with this s**t! You take time for you too!     Take care!	post_6941163
post_6944076	May 29, 2011	212161	1219485	PedroH	I to    know how you feel as i have a mother who has had it for awhile, and yes we have gone throught all your saying. funny how they can be so sweet almost their self and than they become someone we dont know and dont want to know.my mom has gone throught it to, shes very demanding for what ever she needs at that time. i can tell you this there is no telling them you will get it later . it must be done than. they do not understand the later part. the brain just knows at that moment that it needs to be done. what i have learn to do is say ok mom we will get that and sometimes she will let it go for a hour or two, she forgets but if i say mom i will do it later than that sets her off so you need to agree and see how that goes.I would not let her be byself anymore , sounds like shes not thinking in a way that she can be byself. she could cook and forget and burn her and house down. neod on the once o essh ght. doe ssheht .do essheht. does she have long term care? if so they will pay for someone to come in everyday and be with her and at night to.its very hard on us care takers and ya need to remember to give yourself time to, eat /rest and get your time out. i hope you have a great weekend	post_6941163

This may or may not co-exist with dementia, but many younger people develop such delusions.Square one is to insure good nutrition, to include a daily multi-vitamin, and B-12 with folic acid, as well as co-enzyme Q-10 every day. Next is to ensure daily hydration. It goes without saying bloodwork is necessary, specifically to detect anemia.Only then would I consider a psychiatric consult, and would not consider medications unless the delusions became severe enough to interfere with daily activities.	post_6928869
post_6935464	May 25, 2011	144586	None	None	Aricept and Namenda are prescribed for other forms of dementia. There are several etiologies, In the absence of a definitive Alzheimer's diagnosis, and without other symptoms I would be hesitant about taking these medications. Have her take B-12 sublingually with folic acid and Co-Q10.	post_6935010

post_6868460	Apr 30, 2011	None	None	None	hi, and so sorry your grandmother ia going throught this along with your family.my mom takes many pills for her anxiety/panic and its so inportant to make sure they get it on time, a lot of my moms pills have a time that they are working in the body so if one says its 4 hrs than we make sure every 4 hours she gets it so that it can stay in her blood and not be missing as to where she will start to feel bad/stress and when that happens shes so much harder to deal with. so i would say try and find out the life span of the pills shes taking so ya can keep it level in her system.it also can be that its getting worse, my mom is 71 and has had it since she was 65 and yes we can see a difference in her monthly.     as it gets worse yes she will have different changes and they sre not good.    so it could be that to. the most we can do is keep their meds to them on time, and maybe call or take them to the dr and tell them whats going on now so that they can adjust their meds.my heart goes out to you and your family i know how hard it is on ya. please take care of yourself as well.

post_6869813	Apr 30, 2011	1662361	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Hi, Thank you. The people doing her pills now come when every they want, The basically found out my mom and I were getting paid for it which we weren't my grandpa gave us like 5 dollars here and there and said that we need to break and took over and my grandma just went along with it.They were getting their pills once at 7:30 am and then at 3:30 pm they love to go to bed really early. They are now just dropping them off at 10 and 6 or 8 and 5 and they never know when the pills will come and they dont let them know when to take them and its confusing for her.    I know its going to get worse. I just hope that with her meds being at whatever time is convent for the people doing her pills now isnt making her like progress faster ya know?	post_6868382
post_6872849	May 02, 2011	212161	None	None	hum dont think not gettingh er pills on time will make it go faster but do know it does not help her not to get them on time. ya need to talk to whoever is giving them to her and tell them she needs them on time and that if they cant do that, ya will take back over with it. talk to her husband and let him know how inportant it is she gets them on time.	post_6868382

She tried walking out yesterday gown and all. she gets so agitated till she cant breathe. Told me she hated me,and never wanted to see me again. shes just gotten so bad I figured I had time but I guess not. and we got the pills back so we can help regulate her times, but its looking like she may need a round the clock care or a nursing home. I just miss my grandma.	post_6868382

She had a bladder infection a few months ago, it makes her stomach swell up,they have been doing urine samples on her since she got in the hospital and see no infection but she shes really dehydrated.    She's just got bad heart problems right now, if we could keep her heart rate normal we could take her home but as of right now, shes tied to the bed so she cant leave because she trys to run, she gets really mad at you when you tell her shes in the hospital and called me her sister today and not to tell dad.Her doctor had the nerve to tell me she wears him out, shes exhausting to take care of. Im like you have a full nursing staff, its just me and my mom at times. don't tell me how tired you are.Hope things go ok with your mom at the dr's.Thank you for all your help :)	post_6868382

Natural, inexpensive and easy!That's basically a coconut oil regimented supplementation program.Check out coconut    research center, Dr.Bruce Fife and his new book "Stop Alzheimer's Now"I'm a Coconut Oil user for a number of years. Superb health benefits!Should you have any questions please post again.BlessingsNikodicreta	post_6861293

post_6864170	Apr 28, 2011	212161	None	cess21	hi, wanted to say take a deep breathe and relax. first does this run in your family? i can tell you my mom and grandmother has it and so it scares me to, the thing i have learned is if you let it bother you, you will seem to forget more often. i know i worry about it and it seems to make me forget . than i get all up set thinking i have it and that makes me forget more.ok at our age am 51 i tend to forget names to, i think it comes with age. but you can go to your dr and talk to them about your concern.    they have test out that you can take but i see no reason to if all your doing is forgetting names.even if you do the test they say it is not 100 precent that you will get it and knowing me i would worry the rest of my life away and not enjoy it. so i choose not to get any test done and to take it year to year and see what happens.yes there are meds out there to take if yoou for sure have it, they say the meds help to slow it down. as far as inprove your memory they do not do that. but there are ways you can help yourself.stay busy, learn something new everyday. recall what yoou did 3 days ago, work puzzles/play on-line games . my dr said anything that keeps your mind thinking .i hope you have a great day and try not to worry.Barbara	post_6823128
post_7228512	Sep 10, 2011	547368	None	None	Hello Again,I am so very, very sorry to hear about you mom's decline... and I am so very sorry I was not here when you wrote this post. Please excuse me!!I do understand what you are experiencing. My father lived with us for almost eight years. I watched him decline year by year then month by month and finally day by day. It was heart-wrenching. He left this earth a year ago with me at his side..... still in our home. Not a day goes by that I don't miss him immensely!    It was and continues to be thee most difficult thing I have ever done in my life. My heart truly goes out to you!!!Like you I was blessed with sharing our home with dad . I cherish those moments and memories.. as you so wisely have stated.    I gave up much of my life for some years to care for my father, just as you have ... but just like you I have never resented or regretted one moment of that time. I would do it again in a heartbeat... again as I am sure you would.It's been a week since your post. How's your mom doing now? How's your dad holding up? You're right, he needs keep be busy. For many ppl that can be a good coping mechanism.Thanks for reminding our members to love their families. I will add not to forget to hug them, every chance you get. I so wish I could hug my dad again. And don't forget to tell that how important they are in your lives. In the final months my dad enjoyed the reassured that he was a wonderful man, a great human being and a the best father ever... and I told him so often.As I have said here often, don't forget to take care of you too!!! As a Caregiver you must be as strong and healthy as possible, mind, body and spirit. Taking care of you is also taking care of your mom or whatever loved one you or any of us may be caring for! I had great support from this forum and Hospice, that along with my faith got me through some very difficult times. Now the Hospice staff are gone and only my Faith sustains me. I am so very grateful that my dad took me to Church and Sunday School every Sunday when I was growing up. It has been so instrumental in my life. I hope that you have some spiritual support.Please let me know how you are doing. I am feeling better and will be monitoring our site more closely. I'll look forward to hearing from you soon.(((HUGS)))~Tuck	post_7198209
post_7268558	Sep 25, 2011	212161	None	tuck	hi. just got back on today had a few moments as my mom is still asleep. thank you for sharing, your great journey with your Dad, i know its not easy to do,my mom is bed ridden now she has not walked in 2 months and its so sad to see her laying in that bed 24/7 as she was always a go getter.dont seem to bother her most days ever now and than she will want to get up and it breaks my heart to have to try and tell her she jst got back in bed that we went shopping. i know its not true but it seems to help her and shes ok with being in bed than.last night as i was sitting on her bed and holding her hand she told me she wanted my sparker thing. i learn that it was my dia necklace so i took it off and put it on her , she was very happy to have it on her neck. that necklace came from my hubby its a journey necklace and it meant a lot to me . well now it means even MORE. my mom is wearing it for me and one day when i recover it again i will be proud to wear it because she did. its the little things that matter to me know.    when she smiles it makes me happy because she dont do that often, they say thats the last thing to go is the smile, so i look foward to seeing her smile.God Blessed me with great parents Tuck like you was and they took great care of us so in return its our turn, they saw us into the world and we are seeing them out. That is    a Blessing both ways, they were here for us now we are there for them. Hugs to you and yes i get them everyday from my mom and dad because i to know one day that will be gone and when it is i want to feel their arms still around me .	post_7198209
post_7275057	Sep 27, 2011	547368	None	None	Your journey necklace brought tears to my eyes. ... along with the wonderful ways you find to comfort your mom.Your love and kindness means everything to your mom and you now. You won't ever forget these moments.I few weeks ago I drove three hours to visit an old friend of mine who is unfortunately in the dying process. He was healthy and active until a few months ago now he will soon leave this earth. He said one simple sincere sentence that has stayed with me, "It's the cycle."I knew what he meant immediately... the cycle of life, one leaves, another comes. And so it is with our parents and the grandchildren that come to not take their place but make a new place. One day it will be us... I can only hope that our children are as kind and loving to us as we have tried to be to our parents. "It's the cycle."God Bless You and Your Mom.~Tuck	post_7198209
post_7376258	Nov 03, 2011	212161	None	tuck	how are you doing these days?    you always have kind words and its easy to talk to you. as i know you have been where i am at and going.    what do you think is going on in there heads when they try and speak but the words come out all jumbled, do they    here them self saying it right in there head but just cant get it out, how scarey for them, what if they are hurting but cant tell us because they just cant say the right words?    i worry about that and always try and listen to every word she gets out and try to make real live words out of it, its like a guessing game.my mom is now still in bed and eats little, she just looks out a window everyday cares nothing about life really. i have gave her a little stuffed dog that she now pets and talks half the night to, i cant wait to find her one that moves when she pets it or even a baby doll that has some kind of action to it so she can love them and feel like they are real.my mom means the world to me and i want to do whatever i can to live a somewhat good life in her bed and in her own world.	post_7198209
post_7426814	Nov 20, 2011	547368	None	None	I am so sorry I missed your post!! We relocated (to our winter home) and I have had issues with my laptop and internet connection.I wish I knew what they were trying to say... most of the time I think they don't actually know themselves. Sadly when dementia is first beginning many patients are aware of what is happening to them. However I have been told that as time goes on they no long understand what is happening to them or what is happening around them. I pray that is true.I think it is kinder to allow them to remain in their world and make them as content and comfortable as possible. I know it's heartbreaking. So many of my patients families would tearfully say things like, "Is my mom in there somewhere?" .... or ... "Where has my Dad gone?"How are you doing? How's your mom? You have taken on a huge challenge. It's so important to take care of yourself. Of course you love your mother but don't be afraid to take breaks from caring for her. It will renew your energy.I am glad that the dog brings her comfort. She must have loved them in her active years.((HUGS)) to You,Tuck	post_7198209
post_7585524	Jan 13, 2012	212161	547368	Tuckamore	hi, been a while since i have been in here , things are still about the same to me but the nurses of mom says shes crossing over soon. not sure i see all that as she still eats some days and does not seem to be a whole lot worse.she does talk less that we understand and now when i sit by her bed and talk to her she makes no since to me at all but am sure to her shes saying all the right things and i agree with her and go on. i try to talk about what ever comes out of her sweet mouth. strange thing is she can always say back to me how much she loves me, Praise The Lord it keeps me hanging in there .you know mom still seems to understand us so i think she still knows whats going on around her i think, some days are harder to see that.i ask her every day where was she when i came to visit her and she gives me a i dont know so i tell her i knew she had to go to the mall and pick up a few pairs of pants for dad. she just smiles and says yes. i dont want her to feel like shes laying in a bed and wasting away (even though she is) i want her to think shes helping us out and doing all the things she did as a wife and mother, it puts smiles on her face and i can see light in her eyes so i know she belives she really did everything i tell her she did.i hope your doing good , and i hope your holidays were good, i know they were Sad without Dear Dad but hes in your heart forever.my mom will play with my long hair and i tell her mom you made that hair, she just beams, i will forever have her smile and her sweet shinny eyes , in my mind as how proud she is that she had me and how close we are.its been 5 months now since mom walked, its not been easy taking care of her needs, but i will be there every step of the way , i promised her i would take good care of her and for her never to worry i would never put her in a home (she ask me one day if we were) and that she would always be safe and warm in my Home.	post_7198209

post_7234208	Sep 12, 2011	547368	None	None	Hi Upsgrrrl,Welcome to the Senior Health Forum.Your mother's pain level will be similar to anybody else's pain level.... high. This surgery is usually very painful. My adult son had a similar shoulder surgery    though less extensive this winter. He had difficulty sleeping the first few nights, even with pain medications. So expect that she will have significant pain.It's important that she is kept comfortable. Sleep is important for healing and reduced pain levels also promotes better healing.It's my guess they will begin physical therapy as soon as she has healed some. PT will be painful... stretching and strengthening those repaired areas can cause increased discomfort. However PT is an important aspect in a good recovery. If her pain levels are kept to a minimum she'll be more apt to do well in PT.Best of luck to your mom. I hope she'll have lots of support during the post-op and recovery process. I wish her a quick and uneventful recovery.Warm Regards,~Tuck	post_7232851

I have had a difficult few weeks and have been unable to be here as often as I would like.... sorry.I am also very sorry to hear about the loss of your sister. I know the pain of losing a dearly loved family member and my heart goes out to you.I understand your concern and embarrassment. You're pretty young to have a prostrate issue but it could be a possibility. Have you consulted a urologist? They are the specialist in the field. There may be nothing wrong but it can't hurt to have it checked.How much water/liquids do you consume in a day? Certainly too many liquids can cause one to have to urinate during the night. The question in my opinion is why is this not waking you? Are you on medications that make you extra sleepy? That could be a contributing factor.I hope you are still monitoring this site and I again apologize for my tardy response.I'll look forward to your updates.Take Care,~Tuck	post_7179830

There are no physicians in this community but we have some great supportive members.You don't say if you are taking care of your mom or if she lives independently. She's young in years.... too young to be having these medical issues that surely must greatly interfere with normal, daily activities. It's heart breaking that at 62 your mom has so many significant medical issues that are apparently not being addressed.Obviously you mother needs some good medical intervention and care. Her knee pain should be investigated and treated. This alone would allow her to be more active which may help in weight reduction and control. Does she require a knee replacement, physical therapy or medications to ease her pain? Please see that she has this evaluated.Treating her severe knee pain would also insure that she is physically able to get to a bathroom in a timely manner. That alone may help with her bowel and bladder problems.A urologist can determine the reason she has poor urinary control. However if she has both bowel and bladder control problems this may be related to a spinal nerve compression or other systemic problems. Both bowel and bladder incontinence is not common at 62, Again she requires a thorough clinical evaluation.And certainly your mom should not have to live with severe chronic untreated pain. You don't provide a lot of information so I hope you will be able to see that you mother obtains the medical care and support she requires. If you have any additional or specific questions please feel free to ask.Please keep in touch and let us know how your mom is doing.    I'll look forward to your updates.My Best to You and Your Mom,~Tuck	post_7010908

There are certain predisposing conditions leading to dementia like Parkinsonâ  s disease, multiple sclerosis and brain infections lyme disease. Some reversible causes are brain tumors, changes in blood sugar, sodium and calcium, chronic alcohol abuse, low vitamin B12 levels, etc. Symptoms of dementia include difficulty in language, memory, emotional behavior etc. mild cognitive impairment is the stage between normal forgetfulness due to aging and development. There are certain tests like B12 level, blood ammonia levels, blood gas analysis, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, etc. treating conditions like anemia, depression, nutritional disorders, and thyroid disorders. Medications include antipsychotics, mood stabilizers; stimulants etc. consult your neurologist for more details. Take care.	post_6824323

post_6994080	Jun 16, 2011	1711289	None	None	My daughter had both an EIF and multiple Choroid Plexus Cysts found at her 20 week ultrasound.    By the 28 week ultrasound, the Choroid Plexus Cysts were gone.    The EIF was still there, but that was to be expected, as a calcification doesn't just disappear.    I cried and stressed for weeks, but then gave it all to God and knew that what was meant to be would be.    And my beautiful baby girl was born in April of 2010, as happy and HEALTHY as could be :)    So don't stress, Dad... they're SOFT markers for a reason..and they are SO common.    My midwife told me she would bet that nearly ALL babies have Choroid Plexus Cysts at one point or another, but a lot of ultrasounds aren't done during that 1 or 2 week time span where they can be seen...and then they disappear on their own!    And even if they don't disappear, there are children (and adults) who still have cysts in their brain and it does not cause any change in development or learning abilities.Not sure if you and your wife are planning to do the amnio.    I did not, as it is around a 20% chance of miscarriage.    I knew I would love my little girl no matter what...and I do!    And she is absolutely perfect.    Your little boy will be too!    God doesn't give us more than we can handle.    The best thing you can do now is to support your wife.    Make sure she isn't stressing about these findings, as that can cause more harm to the baby than anything else.    Just relax, and in a few months, you will get to meet your PERFECT baby boy :)- Kara	post_6913800
post_7453618	Nov 29, 2011	1908166	None	jib307	Hi, I was just wondering what u ended up doing in that situation. How is your baby boy? I am in the same situation. I had my level II u/s yesterday and they found echogenic cardiac focus on one of the babies heart. I am carrying fraternal twins. They told me the same thing that it is a soft marker for d/s. They also have bilateral choroid plexus cysts. They told me to do an amnio as well but with twins, it is double the risks of miscarriage. I really don't know what to do. I'm 18 wks and 5 days. The hardest part about all this is that I don't want to risk losing the babies but i can't seem to relax after finding out. My husband wants to know just for peace of mind and I do too but its too risky. I don't know anyone who has had an amnio done.	post_6913800

post_7430114	Nov 21, 2011	526144	1762584	bboopy	Hi,How are you? Do you still experience hair loss? Are there other symptoms present? Hair loss is often caused by a sudden physical or emotional stress ( Telogen effluvium) such as fever, severe infection, major surgery, major illness, sudden blood loss, severe emotional stress, crash diets, and certain medications. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Complete medical history and diagnostic tests may help. Take care and do keep us posted.	post_7148469

post_7265535	Sep 23, 2011	None	1257808	MR_WHY	G6PD varies from person to person. Some people who carry it have no symptoms while others do.Answer1:    It is inherited, yes.    You cannot be "infected" with G6PD, it is a gene change that exists in a parent that passed it to you.Answer2:    If you were to have children with a woman who also carried G6PD, the odds or risk would be as follows:50% of girls would be carriers with no symptoms, the other 50% could be affected, but may or may not get sick or have symptoms.50% of boys would be carriers like you, who may or may not develop symptoms, and the other 50% would not be carriers at all.Hope that helps.	post_7261060

post_7200526	Aug 31, 2011	419309	1779334	MahmoudAhmed	The chromosomal DNA anomalies that cause Fanconi's Anemia are inherited; in other words, they are inborn.    They cannot be caused by either HCV infection nor HCV treatment.    The condition of Fanconi's Anemia is a recessive condition caused by DNA differences on the human chromosome, and are passed on from parent to child.    HCV infection and HCV treatment does not affect the human chromosome, so they CANNOT cause chromosomal anomalies nor can they cause Fanconi's Anemia.    However, HCV treatment can exacerbate the symptoms of Fanconi's Anemia in a person who has FA.    Hope that helps. ~eureka	post_7192093

Does your son have any other symptoms.....poor eye contact, trouble with friends, etc?As for the constipation, has he ever been on a completely dairy free diet?    No milk, cheese, sour cream, butter, etc.?    My daughter spent her whole life constipated.    She never drank milk, but she would have one or two slices of cheese/ day.    I read on the internet that cow's milk is the #1 constipator.    So I gave it a try and voila!    She started going every day within a week of starting the diet.    She used to go every 4 or 5 days when she had milk products in her diet.    If she cheats even on sour cream    she gets constipated.As for the negative celiac test:    celiac disease is an autoimmune disease.    Many people just can't digest gluten (they lack the enzymes), and they don't have the autoimmune part.which is gluten intolerance.    Just a thought.	post_7225492
post_7177286	Aug 23, 2011	419309	998108	PARANOID44	There are certain screening tools that can be used to assess risk of spina bifida to your baby.    Neural tube development can usually be seen by ultrasound after 14 weeks, though best visualization by level 2 ultrasound is usually between 18-20 weeks.Your doctor can also order a blood test called AFP (alpha-feto protein) after 15 weeks to see if there are blood levels indicating increase risk for spina bifida. If you have a high level of concern about pre-existing risk, your ob/gyn should be able to refer you to genetic counseling if you let him/her know about your history of spina bifida occulta, though it's a good thing that you have no symptoms... :).Good luck to you and your new pregnancy! ~eureka	post_7176343

It was very common in the past to have relationships with first cousins. Your children if you choose to have any will be perfectly normal.

I think there's enough separation there. I would suggest not stressing about it. Continue with your relationship the way you would have if you never found out, and if marriage and children are discussed in the future, at that time you can worry about seeking genetic counseling.	post_7113284

post_6909399	May 15, 2011	419309	1624353	lisaob1	Genetics is much more complex than boiling it down to "one in four chance."    That particular phrase is used most often in the context of what's known as "recessive" genes, but that is only a very small part of genetics.    The risk of 1 in 4 associated with recessive conditions does not apply to many other genetic patterns. Different genetic conditions exist, and many of them do not follow the rules of recessive inheritance."Recessive" in genetics refers to a condition that is usually benign in a "carrier."    The 'you and your partner' part with recessive conditions depends on the fact that we each get half our genes from our mother and half our genes from our father.    So, for example, you are a female, and you one set of X chromosomes (where genes are located) from your dad, and the other set of X chromosome from your mom.    (The *normal* female pattern is XX; men get their "X" set from mom and their "Y" set from dad.)Now, mom's chromosomes have thousands of genes and and strands of DNA just like dad's does.    However, when eggs and sperm are made, they aren't full human cells, 46,XX, or 46,XY.    Instead, eggs and sperm are haploid, or half of that: eggs are 23,XX and sperm are 23,XX (make baby girls) or 23,XY (make baby boys).    That's where the 1/4 chance happens, because depending on the combination of egg/sperm, recessive genes can express.You can find a useful chart and explanation of how recessive inheritance works here:http://anthro.palomar.edu/mendel/mendel_2.htmRemember, however, recessive conditions are but a small fraction of genetic diseases that exist.    Hope that helps answer your question some.    ~eureka	post_6899581

If you or your doctors suspect that you might have EDS, an evaluation by a medical geneticist would be the best first step.    I'm not sure where you are located, but large teaching universities and affiliated hospitals are the best places to find genetic specialists who can make such a diagnosis.    Good luck.	post_6884656

I gave her a cell phone so she could call me when she needs to...the other night she called 911 five times to report 'George' attacking the kids...the nurse gave her a pill and hid the phone....I'm afraid they just might take it away from her, ha...	post_7559427

I love my mom and its a Blessing to have her with me at this time so i can take care of her like she did me,,,,,,,,,,,	post_7559427
post_7571818	Jan 09, 2012	1923572	None	None	There was a person named George that was a good friend of my step dad's, at first she said this guy just looked alot like George, so she started calling him George.    Then for a little while she thought it was really George (he passed away from cancer about 8 yrs ago).    She told me she thought he took the same drug that Juliett from Romeo and Juliett took when she faked her death, ha...she gets quite creative. Anyway, she has since backed off from that therory, maybe just to appease me.I have recently been diagnosed with Hep C and will be starting treatment in the next 2 weeks, so I have told her I need to back off a bit from helping her with all her stuff.    she said ok at first, then completly forgot by the next day, ha....I need to remind her constantly that I can't do all her running around and will need to focus on my health for a bit...some days that gets her to back down, some days she just gets get mad at me...The main thing is her trying to get out of the nursing home.    she doesn't want to be there, and who could blame her, but she can't take care of her self, and I can't take care of her like she needs either...of course she doesn't think she needs any help and is completly upset that she is in there...her poor room mate is completly scared of her...my mom threw her container of water at the room mate the other day thinking she was George...that went down on her permanant record unfortunatly...she is a hand full and most days I don't have the patience to deal with it, but can't really say anything to her cause whats the point...so I just stay stressed and take deep breaths, ha...I wish she could hallucinate a buddy that she likes and could talk with and would make her stay at the nursing home enjoyable!	post_7559427

She suffers from depression and anxiety....but also diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia (last week they decided to tag it as Lewy Body)....there are a lot of meds that cause issues in the elderly.    We have learned to stay away from SSRI re-uptake inhibitors, she also has to stay away from anti psycotic drugs which will make it worse.    We finally found a doctor who says there are 3 groups of seniors, those with dementia, those with dementia and depression and those just with depression and    they all need to be treated differently.    As we have gotten my mom off of these meds, the hallucinations have stopped.    She takes Pamelor for depression and depakote for anxiety.	post_7559427

She had hallucinations really bad and they were directly linked to that drug. We found out that Seroquel has an adverse effect on elderly people. It is widely prescribed...I can't for the life of me, understand why.    Maybe there are a lot of Dr.s out there who have stock in the company that makes it.	post_7559427
post_7861545	Apr 14, 2012	2113792	None	None	Serquol can be used for several things but that's the first time iv heard of it being used on a alz. Patient they make meds just for the halluctions ,pills and recently the FDA approved a patch. Even with the meds their will still be hallucanations,xanax or ativan can help with keeping the patient calm some. My mother always thought someone. Was outside lookinh thru the windows and they where there to break in and kill her sometimes that would go on for hours.you don't want to upset them or make them mad cause they can get violent so my family and I. Would just take turns following her from window to window because she would pic up stuff and beat the the windows .having to take the stuff away from her upset her so she would useher fist.very tiring but just remember its the disease not ur family member that has alz.when u start to get frustrated....	post_7559427

She faded slowly and died peacefully. I don't believe she had a moment's pain. I wish the same for your mother and all those reaching the end of their lives. My mother was 96.	post_7729005

post_7827660	Apr 03, 2012	1372465	2056525	judy28462	I have to agree with the Ensure, often people who don't want to eat will drink. I have found that alot of patients like ice cream, so what I used to do was mix an Ensure with a small container of softened ice cream and make a shake out of that. The shakes offer a lot of nutrition. Also another suggestion is finger foods. I am not sure if in Stage 4 (?) they are still able to feed themselves. But often in earlier stages the finger foods worked well. Good luck and prayers to you, this is a very difficult time.	post_7729005
post_7861445	Apr 14, 2012	2113792	2056525	judy28462	My mom. Had alz. Most diffently give her ensure,but later on. We used baby food and yogurt. Nothing with chunks of anything though you don't want her to swallow anything that could go into her lungs.if she can or you can still be fedher with a spoon ,if not you can use one of those syringes that you take cough syrup with, sometime you can get larger ones from a pharmacy,as far as cups go u can get those kids sippee cups or the ones that have abuilt in straw on the side.but no ice..you will learn as you go along,I'm so very sorry this has happened to your mother.	post_7729005

post_7807658	Mar 27, 2012	1530171	2073441	Faustina5	Hey Faustina5,Welcome to the forum.If he remembers about the pillow only    later and not upon awakening, it could be a sleep disorder. The electrical activity in his brain to get to the beta state ( normal waking consciousness ) might be delaying this process.An EEG would not be useful, unless it would be performed at the time of awakening. It feels a little impractical. Perhaps a sleep study might shed some more light.Meanwhile pay attention to any other subtle changes, that you may notice.But make sure you're taking notes for future reference.Wishing you all well!Niko	post_7764744

post_7721342	Feb 27, 2012	757137	2011819	leona123watson	You may not know the answer unless he is cured of his addiction. You say he has been "acting like an Alzheimer's patient." That "acting" part is interesting because this is what I suspect in the case of one of my older brothers who is 86. I believe he suffers from severe depression and that this is his way of keeping everyone at bay. Actually he wants to die, but family genes program him to a very old age.	post_7642072
post_7746985	Mar 06, 2012	2065683	2011819	leona123watson	It seems to me, from what you are saying, that there is more than med side effects there. it sounds like the temper tantrums are increasing, or more than before. Family members are usually the first ones to see the problem. A typical symptom of Alzheimers is denial. A person with Alzheimers may deny symptoms to the doctor; it is common. I know this is frustrating. My mother, who has dementia, and probably Alzheimers, claims a "fall on the head" caused itall. She told me she had Alzheimers, later forgot that, then got angry with me that I said she had it. She said I was working against her in telling the family doctor I thought she had Alzheimers. She even denies dementia. She went and got many friends to reassure her that they had the same memory problems at her age. My wife and kids were living with her, and she got really aggressive; moved out to my sisters, sold the house we were living in, sued us, had us evicted, forgot she sued us; all along she seems to think she is the victim of the conflict. You could be in for worse. Remember, your family member is not well. His brain is sick. Memory loss in Alzheimers is slowly progressive. Forming new memories goes first. Old memories are clear. It is a slow fade, and I wish I had known what I was getting into when I moved in with her. I wouldn't have done it. Dave	post_7642072

post_7721284	Feb 27, 2012	757137	1943948	awesomesgal	Not on that specific subject, but on the subject of short-term memory loss I may be helpful. In was in a double-blind study many years ago for gingko biloba. If Alzheimer's is not involved, it will turn the patient around double quick. It has been used for decades in Europe and trials have been made ad nauseum. It works.The question is why she losing memory. It could be depression. It could be insomnia (which is what it was in my case). It could even be something like a candida infestation, which someone claimed was true for his mother..But definitely try the gingko. I was taking Ginkgold, a high quality product. If she has trouble sleeping, give it to her earlier in the day. It is vaguely stimulating. No enough to bother most people, but my problem was insomnia so I was susceptible. Good luck.	post_7522506

I used to teach classes on different Alzheimer's Medical treatments/medicines and know these meds better than the reps that sold them. Namenda is an add on Alzheimer's medication use to help glutamate regulation in the brain.The standard dose in 20mg a day after titration, so taking three 5mg tablets is not a problem. In fact side effects don't really occur with Namenda until the dose is increased to <40mg (it is above recommended dose but many doctors use it at that level).Rest easy.	post_7672509

GOD BLESS YOU and I hope your brothers can see you need help and start giving you some relief. if they cant do it them self than maybe they can pitch in some money for you to hire someone.	post_7526967

post_7344462	Oct 21, 2011	None	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Hey Barbara!Well, since both the mother and the grandmother got the disease beyond 65 years of age, these are likely to be sporadic cases (with little genetics involved), as is seen in a majority of cases with the disease. Itâ  s only minority of cases (less than 1%) that are believed to be genetically linked. These usually present before 65 years of age. Environmental more than the genetic factors are believed to have a major role in the development of the disease.Though none of these have been proved yet, factors that may be involved in an early development of disease are hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, excessive exposure to environmental pollution, electromagnetic waves etc. Adequate control of the factors may play a role in preventing or in delaying the onset of the disease.Other factors that may be beneficial in preventing or delaying the onset of the disease include are a higher level of education, keeping the brain regularly involved, such as in activities like reading, solving puzzles, calculation, music, art etc., dietary aspects like following a â  mediterranean dietâ   (red wine, with plenty of fruits and vegetables), the Indian spice â  turmericâ   etc. Low dose aspirin/ NSAIDS and medical marijuana may also be effective in the process.Hope this information helps.Take care!	post_7333766

post_8169459	Jul 23, 2012	1530171	None	ALL	RH8823 why wait? Your grandpa's spirit is alive, so no matter whatthe pathology and symptoms are, you can be with him in a non-verbal communication, perhaps holding his hand,    as you let go of any limiting thoughts or feelings. There's a moment, when in a flash,something divine happens and you will know it. You and your grandpaare having a chat -perhaps the last one in the physical world-with no words exchanged. Far fetched you may say.Only because of the lack of understanding, as the conscious mindis trained to reject the notion of such a possibility. It is real though!I have experience it many times myself and I've facilitated it for others.As long as one is open to Spirit. Your Grandpa's mental filter ( conscious mind) is weaker, so he IS open to Spirit.I hope you can get the time off and be there BEFORE he passes on.heartfluttersflyawayplz    1sweetpea    midmurphyMy mom passed on in May. I had the opportunity to see her alive,as I'm 10,000 miles away, in February, after the passing of my younger brother at the end of January.We Always had this special connection- spiritual if I may say- and she recognised me from 100ft away when I went to visit her at the nursing homeI went pass all the medical labels and symptoms and reached for her soul.The staff there were quite puzzled, seeing her face light up, interacting and communicating with me with whispering words that made no sense at all, but I KNEW what she was saying!Every day we had this wonderful exchange for about half to one hour,for the following 3 weeks. meanwhile I had found out from the staff that her hearing was impaired, her comprehension was very limited and her vocal chords could not produce any sounds ( she was only able to whisper)So all our communication was non-verbal.We're accustomed to view things from the negative side in life.We pay attention to horrific events like mass shootings and we tend to overlook sometimes nice things like the spirit in our loved ones, seeing more their symptoms and their conditions perhaps, be it Alzheimer's or Dementia or anything else.Of course we cannot ignore their physical suffering so we must ensure that everything possible is done to alleviate this."Pass On" a poem by Michael Lee    (YouTube Video) is a MUST view for everyone but specially for the individuals that lost loved ones.Just do a search.

post_7982061	May 24, 2012	585414	2060367	sara304	What seems like extreme negativism and aggressive behavior patterns that worsen with age can sometimes be the onset of some form of minor dementia. It would be worthwhile to discuss with a gerontologist. Also see if you can have a social worker coordinate some of the assistance she might need to help. Additionally it would be worthwhile to see if there are some programs such as a senior center or community center that might interest her as she might have become depresed (which can express itself as irritability or anger sometimes) and helping her to keep active and engaged might help with this.	post_7737656

post_7374829	Nov 03, 2011	1840205	1870758	scimom2005	Hi.    Thank you for your reply.    I agree with what you said.    I to could be visiting a cemetary.    I am very grateful I am not!        It is hard to remember that sometimes.    Me and my son fight alot.    It seems we take our anger and frustrations out on each other.    I know we are just frustrated with the situation but it is hard.    It seems to be getting worse.    I honestly do not know how to find a balance between me and him.    I feel like I have to be selfish and demand a minute to myself.Do you ever get regular breaks?    What do you do for stress?    I love my son no doubt. I feel like he doesn't care about what I am going through because he feels he has it worse so what I am going through cannot be to bad.    It's not that it is absolutely horrible or anything.    In the morning is the worst.    Before I get him in his chair we argue about stupid little things and it makes me grumpy all day long.    He knows how to push my buttons I guess.    I guess other people really do not have this issue.    I just would like to find a way for us to not get angry at each other every morning.	post_7322648
post_7943910	May 11, 2012	1446412	1840205	scimom	I guess I a m a bit late arriving at this post/subject.    Hope all is going better for you and your son these days.I am also a single mom with an adult child.    Unlike you, who have only been doing this for 5 years, I have done it for my child's entire lifetime. 30 years+ without a single break or a single day off. It is a 24/7 job of dedicated loving care.    It is hard work but it is also the most rewarding job that you could ever do.    It does not get any easier to be a care provider as you go along in time.    You just adapt to your lifestyle and learn different coping skills.You both have a great deal to work through.    You thought your son would remain active and healthy and so did he.    What a shock to both of you. This does not just entail care giving on your part.    It entails entire lifestyle changes for both of you.    The more you show your son that you resent doing this, the more he will argue with you .    That is natural human nature.    He is testing you!    He feels bad.    When you argue, you force him to perceive himself as a "burden".    As the previous poster said "what if he did die?"    What if his perception of feeling like a burden led him to commit suicide (heaven forbid).    What if he just simply gave up?Like it or not, it is what it is.    You have to come to terms with it.    It is going to require that you change your life in so many ways.    You will find that old friends suddenly do not call to ask you to go places with them anymore.    Well, they were never REALLY your friends so get over it. You will find that as time goes on you will spend your time with new friends. Those friends will have disabilities or children with disabilities.    What you are going through now is that you are still attempting to live between two worlds. Your old "normal" world and the world of people with disabilities.    You are attempting to combine them both but that is impossible or you will tear yourself in two. Eventually, you will find that you have to make a choice. Your old world or your new world.I can tell you that this "new world" that you have begun to enter is a beautiful world.    It is much more beautiful than the one you are leaving behind with the friends who you are about to permanently lose. Your new world is a world that is many times more beautiful and REAL and has so much more technicolor than the old one. You will grow to love this world of people with disabilities and that is when you will find your "job" fulfilling and rewarding and not just "work"Think about this...If your son had remained healthy and active, you would have just assumed that that was the natural course of things in everybody's life and you would probably now be going out to work at a stressful job (if you could find a job in this job market or had not been laid off) and complaining about that (not saying that you are a complainer, just using as an example) or something else.    It is just human nature.    You would never have been exposed to this world of people with disabilities.    You would have missed so much wonder and beauty in your life and that of your son's.God has His reasons for everything that happens in each of our lives.    They are not our reasons. It is not for us to try to understand His reasons.    Our job is to accept His will.    If you can do that and offer your trials as penance and sacrifice for the will of God, you will find this road to be a very extremely easy one to navigate.    He will always console you and He will always give you whatever you need or ask for and make your "burden" light.You and I probably perceive this somewhat differently because your son was once "normal" (for lack of a better word).    My child was born this way.    I never had high hopes or expectations for 13 years which were suddenly and abruptly ripped away.    However, I have had to worry about medical issues and possible death.    That is a much harder option to carry around inside.    And that is what the last mother was trying to tell you in her post.    Be thankful for every day and every minute that you have with your son.It is not easy never to be able to go to the hairdresser or market or places that people take for granted without also having to load a wheelchair into your car and the time it takes to get ready to even get to those places in the first place.    that won't change.    When people pressure you to do something and you just cannot fit it into your schedule, you just need to know how to say, and firmly mean, these 2 phrases:    (1.) "my plate is full" and (2.) "NO".    After that, go out and have some fun with your son and laugh with one another and be fun with each other just like the old days.You had high hopes and expectations that were suddenly snapped away from under you.    That is the same thing that your son is probably feeling too.    You both need to heal and then go on to a new and more beautiful world and lifestyle where you will see the beauty in people as God sees us.    From the inside.    When you arrive in that place, you will never look at people the same way again. And you will enjoy every minute of every day even if you never have another single break or alone time again in your life.    You just cannot live torn between two worlds.    You need to make a choice and then go on.    You are here now!If you ever want to talk about coping skills or anything regarding disabilities, or just vent or anything feel free to give me a jingle. we all need to vent at times.You are NOT alone!Cead	post_7322648

post_7922361	May 03, 2012	144586	None	None	The trouble I have had with social workers, health care aids, and so-called "professionals" who specialize in "eldercare" would fill a book, and you would be bored after the third sentence. Better to watch re-runs of ER. Or worldwide wrestling.    I am involved in supervising (or interfering) in the care of half a dozen very elderly individuals, with no personal gain, and I feel like a lone B-17 pilot on a mission during WW2, going through 1000 miles of flak, two engines out, and no fighter cover. With no ammunition for the ball turret.    I have been forcibly thrown out of and banned from at least three nursing homes after preferring charges against the owners for elder abuse. In one case I informed the physician on duty that he was misinformed believing I was making a "suggestion" regarding his patient care. I was giving him a direct order. This fact was made clear when the police arrived. Sometimes I think the French army had the right idea during the first world war when they shot every other soldier to "encourage the others". Perhaps the practice should be considered for nursing home owners and those who own senior care businesses? Just kidding. But from what I have seen the eldercare world is filled with people who have no affect, common sense, or humanity. People who couldn't pour water out of a boot with directions on the heel.    Perhaps in a town in the middle of Colorado with only three people there might be one person, but I haven't found them. Tomorrow I will buy flowers take the train go to visit an elderly women forced from her home and involuntarily dragged 100 miles from where she lives (by a "non-profit" that specializes in sucking the lifeblood from the destitute) under a court order alleging she is incompetent (an 81 proceeding in this state) and being held prisoner with an electronic tag (like a dog) that sounds an alarm if she moves too far down the hallway. She was crying and holding me when I left her yesterday. I am in the process of writing a motion to the Supreme Court to relieve her court-appointed guardian (another poltical racket - hopefully sending him to a place with bars and no commissary where he can buy protection from the Mexican drug gangs to preserve his life) and secure her some dignity. And I will bring her flowers and her roomate, who is dying and has not had a visitor in a year. Don Quiote on the way to battle the dragon. I cannot visit my 107 year old pal at present (after years of daily care for her) because her brain-damaged son showed up, fired her attorney of forty years and hired one he found in a health-food bar who believes in astrology, the faith-healer "John of God", and the virtue of Bernie Madoff, and they promptly had her declared incompetent by removing her hearing aid and glasses and bringing her before a judge in a sequestered hearing. And banned visitors. Presumably, hoping she will die soon so the son can make his "motion picture" with the sale of her estate. I have recently come to the conclusion there is such a thing as evil in this world, and many of the demons seems to have found a niche in the care of the elderly.I don't know what the answer is in finding people to assist in the care of your elderly loved one. Supervision involves a situation somewhat like the captain of an old sailing ship who would remain on the quarterdeck. Be though familiar but not vulgar. And be prepared not to be liked. Preferably being liked, but not necessarily."A man must do his duty and let other things trouble him not, for they are things without rhyme or things without reason, or things that have rambled and know not the way.."Marcus Aurelius - Commander of the Legion	post_7654042

Then I stained and urethaned the wood. They you purchase the supports which go in a groove under the rail. I got solid brass so they were expensive, but plated supports are cheap. They must go into a beam in the wall. Another possibility is aluminum "speedrail", which can be asssembled like a toy and which comes with a set of supports.	post_7665970

Think of the happy times together, and remember that we all have but a short time to live and to breath and all will eventually pass to the world beyond. The moving finger writes, and having writ, moves on.    At one time I didn't believe in life after death, or the human soul, but I have changed my mind. I believe some day you will meet her again in the afterlife. I used to ridicule those who believed in God and prayed, but I have come a hundred and eighty degrees. If you belong to a church go there and spend some time alone.    There is no answer to grief, except that time seems to ease the pain. You will get upset by the fact that others will listen to what happened and then change the subject to themselves within seconds. It's the nature of the beast. When you lose a loved one, the loss and grief is always personal. I will say a prayer for her.	post_7755361
post_7711103	Feb 23, 2012	144586	None	None	If you have a hired aide to take out your mom, dad or loved ones, you should establish a wheelchair protocol. Do not assume because someone has "been doing this for twenty years" they can pour water out of a boot with directions on the heel. I ended up firing thirty-seven (count em') heath care aides before fining several that were competent.(1) Instruct them that the patient will only be take    across streets at crosswalks and then only then the light turns green and only when the light changes from red to green.(2) no talking on their cell phones while pushing the wheelchair.(3) If there is a very steep ramp, make sure they hold on with both hands, and consider having them back down the ramp. In the case of my little one there was a specific steep ramp at her apartment    Immediately after tell me "I've been doing this before you were born..." she let the wheelchair run away and my little one barely escaped with her life. After this I kept a "safety lanyard" in the chair storage compartment. Essentially a short length of clothesline tied to the chair the air with another end to loop around her wrist whenever negotiating this dangerous slope..(4) Set up "approved routes" to take your loved one for an outing. Walk the aides through these routes. Avoid cobblestones and rough sidewalk surfaces. Do not assume an aide will be able to take your loved one out with such guidance.(5) When the wheelchair is parked with the patient, ideally this will be with the chair at the end of the park bench so the caregiver is next to them and able to both hold their hand and have them see them. Not with the wheelchair parked in front of them.(6) Instruct them to make sure to be extra careful when crossing in front of a the truck with a high cab. The driver will NOT be able to see you and many will "jump the light". Be careful if you see the light change to green and a tanker is approaching. In an unbaffled tanker, water, gas, oil or chemical, the fluid can slosh forward and slide the rig right across the crosswalk. After the vehicle has apparently come to a full stop!.(7) Seat belts are an issue. I see no need for them around the house (in the little four wheeled chair), but some health care aids will insist on using them for "insurance purposes". They can be psychologically upsetting to an elderly person. I solved this problem by cutting them off the indoor chair and forcing the aides to remove the belt whenever the chair was parked using the large outdoor chair.(8) Have the aides lower the chair over a curb while you are watching, and have them set up and fold the wheelchair under your supervision at least once.(9) On a bus always remain next to the patient (when if you have to stand) and preferably keep a hand on their shoulder. Some streetcars and subways have no way to secure the wheelchair in the car, so make sure both brakes are set with the chair at ninety-degrees to the wall.	post_7672130
post_7716374	Feb 25, 2012	144586	None	None	One of the "protocols" involving wheelchairs should be to insure the wheels are sanitized after a trip outside. I was in the habit of keeping a bottle of rubbing alcohol and a rag in the carrier behind the chair when taking my charge outside. When we parked I would wipe the wheel top.    I am willing to bet that the average wheelchair user never ever washes the wheels. Nor do the health care aides.The biggest problem in the park where I used to like to go was dog poo. It seemed to be everywhere, despitethe pooper-scooper laws.    It would get on the wheels and my little one would like to rest her hands on the wheels when we parked. Needless to say the elderly cannot afford infections and it is but a small distance from the bacteria on the wheel to the hand and to the patient's mouth.The wheels on both the small four-wheeled chairs and the larger chairs (with the big wheel) should be sanitized on a daily basis.	post_7672130

post_7654030	Feb 04, 2012	144586	None	None	Gaffer tape is a generic term for a tape used primarily in the motion picture industry. It provides a strong water resistant bond to secure photographic mounts to cars or painted surfaces that can be removed easily without leaving glue residue or damaging the surface. It comes in various widths and colors. It is sold on the internet, at motion picture equipment rental stores and the better photographic supply stores. It is ideal for covering extension cord or cable that must be run over a floor that you don't want someone to trip on. That's what it is commonly used for on a movie set. It's a bit expensive, but the greatest thing since sliced bread. You can use it for everything duct-tape can be used for, only it can be easily removed. Thus, for hurricane protection you will have a mess getting duct-tape off the windows if you have taped them. Gaffer tape comes off zip....	post_7556189

As you must know not many would take on the challenge. You have my admiration.I cared first for my Grandmother in my home and then for my father some fifteen years later. Dad was in our home for eight years until his death last year. I don't regret on moment. However not matter how much we love them some days can be difficult.... and though caring for a loved one brings joy and gratification it can also present some major challengesI am not sure what you mean when you say, "Fighting her battles." I would guess that most of us can't    imagine how draining it would be to spend three and a half years confined to a wheelchair and dependant upon others for most everything. It must impact your spirit and wear on your self-esteem. I would not be surprised if she is just plain tired of her physical situation. She may have lost her will to fight, understandably so.Is your MIL have contact with friends? Is she in therapy of any type? Imagine what she has lost!! My heart goes out to her!    The will to "fight" is often more mental then physical. It's my guess she no longer has that "will" to fight.I would suggest that you look into some therapy for your MIL. Maybe a good therapist will give you better insight    as to what is going on with your MIL. It will also provide her an outlet to share her inner feelings.... things a mother often can't share with a son.Again you have my admiration. Bless you and your partner for the care you are extending to your future MIL. It sounds like you have a good support system but don't forget to take care of you.... and your relationship!I hope you'll keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.... and how you resolve this situation.Blessings,~Tuck	post_7489234

When a person has had a stoke and has confusion, I believe the best place for them is a nursing home because they can have 24 hour trained caregivers. Sounds like he needs someone to be "watching" him day/night, something you can not realistically be expected to do. Try not to feel guilty and blame yourself, focus on your family/children and whats best for them too. What if something would happen (such as burning your house down) to one of your children, how would the guilt affect you then?    Although it may be tough, try to visit often, and make the best of the situation. Most nursing homes aren't as bad as people think. Take care!	post_7296989

The worst of all my symptoms, in the last year, has been the brain fog. It is absolutely horrible. It seems to be getting worse. I can't find a doctor that takes this seriously.

Macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects the macula, the part of the eye that allows you to see fine detail. It does not hurt, but it causes cells in the macula to die and may lead to a loss of vision in both eyes. Regular comprehensive eye exams are highly recommended for early detection.

post_7632457	Jan 28, 2012	419309	1992576	chikitachula	You did not mention why your doctor told you about a possible heart defect, but it would be important to know what testing you had and what the results were.    It's important to remember that "could" is different from "does", and also, that an isolated heart defect does not necessarily mean your baby has Down syndrome.Pregnancy can be complicated by any number of factors, and though most pregnancies carried to full term result in healthy babies, about 3% of the time baby may need some medical intervention for one health reason or another.    Because about 50% of babies with Down syndrome have some malformation of the heart, if a baby has a heart defect, it raises concerns for Down syndrome, but it does NOT mean baby has it -- it's just that heart defects are frequent in children with Down syndrome or other conditions like DiGeorge syndrome.    Oftentimes a congenital heart defect is isolated -- that is, not related to any other condition -- and in many instances can be surgically corrected so that baby suffers no long-term ill-effects.Please discuss with your doctor why he has concerns for baby's heart, and other testing options that may be available to you.    If you are in the second trimester of your pregnancy, you should ask your doctor about amniocentesis, which can test for Down syndrome, as well as fetal-echocardiography, a specialized ultrasound to look at baby's heart. Most large university hospitals have specialized Perinatologists who can assist you with consultation and testing options.Though certain conditions (like diabetes) or medications (Lithium) can increase the risk for heart defects in pregnancy, more frequently heart defects are just happenstance, just like Down syndrome -- not that mother did anything wrong at all.    Down syndrome and usually heart defects are 'genetic' -- don't blame yourself... do take care of yourself.    Hope that helps, and best of luck. ~eureka	post_7628045

post_7690485	Feb 17, 2012	1809109	None	None	The best way you can understand your chances of having a healthy baby is to talk to a genetic counselor. Blood groups rarely have any impact on the health of a fetus (with the major exception of a Mother who is Rh - and a baby that is Rh+). Really it's the hidden genes that are scary. For example, if you have any family history of diseases like cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, etc. these can stay hidden for generations because they can be "carried" without being shown. I suggest you talk to an ob/gyn or your regular dr to help you get in touch with a genetic counselor. Then make sure you take in all your medical family history - you never know if a second cousin who has a genetic disease could be relevant to you. The more info the geneticist has, the better they can help you. This geneticist will also help you learn what your baby is most at risk for, how to test for these and what to watch out for. (For example Caucasians are more likely to carry cystic fibrosis than another ethnicity.)Also it's quite possible your relation has nothing to do with not having a baby yet- it takes an average of a year for a normal healthy couple to conceive. It's still a good idea to get checked out with a gyn if you feel that something could be wrong, but right now you're still ok. I know it may seem like forever, but a few months is nothing.I still think it's a good idea for you and your husband to seek out a genetic counselor though to fully know what possibilities you have at a genetically healthy child.	post_7690456
post_7660022	Feb 06, 2012	1809109	None	None	Personally I agree with you, you do have a lot to offer as a subject- particularly in fields like immunology which are still trying to be understood. I know the many medical research happens at Universities. I suggest trying to contact some of the more prestigious ones around where you live and seeing if they need a research subject. Also if there is any place like the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (which is in Seattle, Washington) near where you live that might be another place to contact.	post_7659755
post_7619188	Jan 24, 2012	1872071	None	None	For instance, babies who suffer from mental retardation due to fragile x are often born with things like flat feet, strabismus, double joints, low muscle tone.    Are those, and similar characteristics the characteristics that set fragile x apart? I know the ate lots of characteristics a fragile x baby is born with but that's all j could think of.    Also is "stimming" more common in people with fragile x vs.    someone who became intellectually impaired for other reasons?	post_7619149
post_7620627	Jan 24, 2012	1809109	None	None	The only kind of drug I can think of that causes an obvious mental disability is fetal alcohol syndrome. But the physical characteristics are pretty obviously different from fragile X.Stimming is honestly a big red flag for autism. All spectrum of autism seem to have that in common. It might be rocking back and forth or other similar motions, but that repetitive body movement is something I know they look for when trying to diagnose autism (again any spectrum). I've only ever met one child with fragile X and he was diagnosed under the umbrella of autism too. So my experience with fragile X is pretty much limited to textbooks.I do know of one child I grew up with who, although she had a reading disability, she had normal intelligence and no obvious signs of autism. She used to flap her arms whenever there was something exciting or big happening around her. When she was about 11 or so a doctor realized she was legally blind and found some corrective glasses; her stimming stopped. For her, Stimming was a way to unleash the tension from all the sensory input that her body couldn't make sense of. So I know from at least one case, stimming isn't necessarily caused by a mental disability or autism.	post_7619149
post_7622248	Jan 25, 2012	419309	1872071	GirlTalk2012	I cannot speak to what other conditions may or may not mimic the symptoms of fragile x, but what sets fragile x syndrome apart from other mental and developmental delays/autism spectrum disorders is that it has been mapped to a specific gene location on the human chromosome (genotype), and there is some understanding how the expansion manifests itself (phenotype).Although many other causes of developmental/autism spectrum disorders have yet to be identified, fragile x is specifically an expansion of genetic material on the X chromosome.    Though it's possible that many other chromosomal variations and/or drug exposure in-utero can cause similar symptoms after birth, fragile x is an inherited disorder, and its presence cannot be impacted by a mother's exposure to drugs or medications during pregnancy.At this time, there is no "cure" for fragile x; identifying the cause of mental disability/autism as fragile x or not helps physicians and caregivers identify the best course of management.    Hope that helps.	post_7619149
post_7609330	Jan 20, 2012	1809109	None	None	No and yes. Type O blood type is caused by the recessive gene of O,O alleles. That means that the only allele a person with type O blood can pass    down is O. Someone with B type blood must have the genotype B,O-so one that person's parents must have to have a B blood type or an A,B blood type in order to pass that down.HOWEVER there is a VERY rare condition that I studied while I was taking genetics. I just can't remember what it's called. I thought it was something like Pompeii syndrome I can't find it and my text book is in storage. :/ Anyway the ABO blood typing is decided on based on the antibodies and sugars that hold to the blood cells, and in this freakishly rare disorder the sugars don't hold on to the blood cell. So a person can show type O blood while in reality not being type O at all. Basically a person can really have type B blood and have those antibodies that show they're type B floating around, but because of a mutation that antibody won't stick to the blood cell and it looks like they have none. This is the only way it's genetically possibly for a parent to show type O blood and have a child with B (Or for a parent with A,B to have a child with O). But this is a very very rare disorder that really only shows in people with a very specific ethnic background (I believe from only one part of Italy). So while it's theoretically possible it's extraordinarily improbable.The negative or positive comes from a different gene. A positive Rh is dominant to negative. So if someone has the genotype +/- they would show positive. If both parents are positive there could be a 25% chance of having a baby with a negative Rh type. However, this can lead to problems. My sister in law was told that this could have been the reason she miscarried one of her babies and it caused some major health problems for one of my nieces. Because the baby was Rh-, her immune system was fighting off the maternal blood which lead to a severe case of anemia. She's fine now, but it initially caused a lot of problems. On the reverse if a mother is negative Rh and has a baby with +/-, she herself could die. The baby's blood would get mixed into the mothers and the mother's immune system would attack the fetus; usually causing a miscarriage and making the mother very ill. SO if a person's parents are both Rh+ they can have a baby with Rh- blood type; however if both parents are Rh- they cannot have a baby with a Rh+.If you are worried that you are type B and your parents O, or that your baby is B and you and your partner are O I would suggest retesting the blood type first. Then I would suggest maybe looking into seeing if someone was unfaithful, the hospital messed up, or someone was adopted.	post_7609149
post_7577318	Jan 10, 2012	1809109	None	None	If you're worried about the drug you're on, look it up in a medical book or online. These usually tell you what kind of class their in. Like Vitamins are in A or something because they're usually really safe to take... where as my lipitor is in X because it's known to cause dangerous problems (deformities or miscarriages) during a pregnancy. If you don't trust your doctors opinion, as a pharmacist. Usually they've got an extensive knowledge on the type of drugs they hand out, so they will know if something is flagged as dangerous. That being said one of my friends did loose a baby because of an anxiety disorder that cause lots of stress, high blood pressure, and occasional panic attacks. So even if you are wary, remember you are prescribed them for a reason and can even help keep both you and the baby safer than without them. (This is usually where the doctor's opinion comes in because they have to way up if it's safer to have the drug or not.)Panic disorders aren't necessarily hereditary. Sometimes if someone has something like hyperthyroidism that causes frequent panic attacks then there is a strong family history associated with that. So no guarantee either way about passing on it to the baby; it really depends on what causes the disorder. Even then genetics aren't always a clear copy and paste- environment plays a huge factor.I really don't think a c section would make you less likely to have postpartum depression- that might be a little hearsay. Postpartum depression is really caused by the huge differences in hormones and your body trying to regulate them (or at least from what I understand). Personally, it's a very scary thought and I might be more at risk as I have suffered from major depression in the past. That being said, although I'm not currently ttc, I have taken steps about it. 1: Talk to your partner. Let them know how you're feeling, and what to watch out for. Any major mood differences, sometimes an outside person has a better chance of seeing that then we do.    If you are doing this alone, ask a friend or relative to help you in those crucial few weeks after birth to make sure you're mental health is doing ok. 2: talk to your ob/gyn they will help you learn about preventative measure, vitamins and the like that might help lower your risk. They will also help give you a list of what you need to watch out for. 3: if you do start feeling a little down, maybe talk to your doctor about seeing a counselor or psychiatrist. There is no need to jump straight to pills, but maybe just talking to someone could help.As far as your morning sickness- some people have difficultly eating ANYTHING because they just feel constantly sick. Others have difficulty not eating or cooking food because they get so hungry so fast. And others still have no obvious symptoms of pregnancy until they get the belly, boobs, and kicks. A woman can even experience different symptoms during different pregnancies. My mom's friend had 6.. her first one the only thing she could stomach the first 3 months was a baked potato. Her second one she had no morning sickness at all, she would just have to eat. Each of her pregnancies were different. But all of her kids and heck even her kid's kids are healthy and good. Whether or not you have morning sickness doesn't mean you'll have a bad/good/hard/easy/unhealthy/healthy pregnancy. It's just down to the woman, their pregnancy, and what's going on in their body at that time. No worries.	post_7577148

post_7566990	Jan 07, 2012	None	None	None	Honestly there is a lot of risk.. I mean it's high potential for two second cousins but because your parents were also cousins that means there could be worse risk factors.I suggest you talk to a genetic counselor who will help you see and determine the risk factors. It's not just what you have too that could be passed, as I see you are aware, it's what's hiding. If you can, get a health history dating back through his parents (and yours) and grandparents to where your family trees meet. Taking this to the genetic counselor might help them determine the full risk factors of having a baby and the possibility of having a healthy one.Besides adoption, have you thought about a sperm or egg donor? It's not that one of you guys are completely damaged but the risk of you two coming together.. so it could be an option.	post_7566650
post_7561046	Jan 06, 2012	1809109	None	None	Yes there is some part of genetics associated with cancer, but that doesn't mean someone is powerless. Even with something as well known as the breast cancer gene -if you have it you still have a chance of never getting breast cancer. And you don't have to have the gene to get breast cancer you can still get it. Your environment matters greatly. Know the symptoms and risks for what cancers run in your family and lower your own- Don't smoke, eat plenty of high fiber, fruits and veggies, exercise. Etc. Maintain a healthy life style and never ignore symptoms that seem suspicious. Your healthy habits will pass on to your kids and hopefully help prevent them from getting any thing.We are not bound by our genetics. Family history matters because it shows us what we may be more at risk for, but the ultimate choice is the way you choose to handle what you're given. That really determines your health.	post_7560876

It is not at all unusual for women to have early miscarriages or chemical pregnancies; however, since this is repeated losses for you, additional testing could be considered.Though most likely your doctor is correct and this may not be genetic, it would be appropriate to test the fetal tissue from your D&C for chromosomes, and perhaps also do peripheral blood karyotype (also a test of chromosomes) on you and your partner if it has not already been accomplished.

post_7526653	Dec 25, 2011	None	1952671	bani93	The above results you posted do NOT at ALL mean you are likely to have a child with Down Syndrome.    The chromosome analysis shows that the large marjority the baby's cells were normal female: 46,XX, but there were some cells that were missing an X and some that had an extra X.When cells divide during a development of a pregnancy, sometimes there can be errors in division, but the result of that testing on your pregnancy does NOT mean you cannot have healthy babies.    Many times the presence of extra or missing chromosomes is happenstance and has nothing to do with the parent, it's simply bad luck.    However, with those results, you might benefit from genetic counseling and testing of your own chromosomes to exclude contributory factors.    Best of luck.ducky406:Many women with Turner's syndrome are highly functional and suffer no mental retardation, and although infertility is the norm other health problems may not be present in many cases.	post_7523252
post_7524109	Dec 24, 2011	1809109	None	None	I'm confused, is that your karyotype for your current pregnancy? Even if it's not it sounds like you are very likely to have a child with down syndrome, or like the karatype is- turner's syndrome, or Triple X. These are caused when you're eggs don't divide chromosomes right, making some with too many and some with not enough. This likely caused your miscarriages, as most errors in division aren't viable.With Turner's syndrome (Having only one X) the female child is likely to be moderately to extremely mentally retarded, infertile, and may have other health issues. Down syndrome comes with it's luggage of higher risks for heart disease and the level of mental disability varies based on how much of the chromosome is doubled (sometimes only part of a chromosome is added). I'm less familiar with Triple X, but while it can cause some issues, the child is much more likely to be "normal" in appearance and mental capabilities.	post_7523252

post_7366015	Oct 31, 2011	1809109	None	None	There is something called the Autism Spectrum. This is a large bubble that they put children into who have specific traits: typically low ability for empathy or social skills, ocd traits or repetitive behaviors. Now the problem with the Autism Spectrum is that every child is unique and they can fall anywhere from being a functioning brain child (considered "high range or functioning") with no apparent social skills to a mute child unable to handle any changes or variations in his or her daily life (considered "low functioning"). Also many other genetic and environmental issues can act similar to Autism.Pdd and aspergers are both TYPES of autism that fall in the higher range of the spectrum (Well I'm not sure about Pdd, but aspergers definitely does). So with your child what happened was at 2 they noticed specific traits unique to children who fall within the Autism spectrum. Because there are so many types, they didn't know what it would be classified under so they might have just said you're child is autistic. When he was 2, pdd was diagnosed- and personally I feel like this is just a temporary diagnosis until they can better qualify where your child is and what specific need he will have. However by 8, they had seen enough to be able to be confident that he definitely has aspergers.Now as far as the genetic goes, as far as I'm aware they haven't linked any specific chromosome to autism although there is definitely a genetic connection somewhere. (My nephew and his father both have Aspergers.) Now they ruled out Fragile X syndrome which can be a misdiagnosis of someone within the lower functioning autism spectrum. Fragile X is also a productive mutation as one of the "arms" of the Chromosome X duplicates then gets "longer" with each generation until a fetus is no longer viable. So its possible that a small duplication on the X chromosome that could be considered Fragile X Syndrome and could have been the cause of your child's behaviors. However, that was ruled out so it's not. You don't have to worry about it.Now a triplication chromosome 13 ptsktsktsk is telling you that on one of his chromosome 13 (everyone has 2 of each kind), a specific gene or allele mutated. In this case, if I'm reading it right he has 2 more tsk than he needs. Unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done about this, this is his DNA. Sometimes one good chromosome can pick up the slack of the malfunctioning one, or at least limit the effect. However, sometimes it's not enough and there is an issue. I'm not very familiar with your child's specific mutation but you might want to consider talking to a specialist. He or she will be able to let you know what to expect, what to look out for, and how to help your son live a happy life.	post_7365244

Seems odd to think of but there are realistically thousands of bacteria on your penis and your hands so you need to make sure you keep good hygiene, even if you're just touching the outside of your body.	post_7329909

post_7293323	Oct 04, 2011	1809109	None	None	Have you ever taken any genetics or had any introduction to genetic diagrams? It's kind of hard to explain otherwise, but here's a go...Using a cystic fibrosis as an example, because it's a serious genetic disease that is actually pretty common. Cystic fibrosis is a what is called an autosomal recessive disease. Autosomal because its not on the X or Y sex chromosomes, but on one of the other ones. It's recessive because if one parent has the normal gene and the other parent doesn't the child will only show the normal gene. Which means the disease can stay hidden for many many years. So what does that mean for you?Well if your great grandfather was a carrier of cystic fibrosis then your a grandfather has a 50/50 chance of having it, as does her grandfather. Now unless my math is wrong that means that both your parents would have a 25% chance of carrying the disease and you each would have a 12.5% chance of it. This 12.5% chance doesn't seem like much and it is a recessive gene if you married someone in another family you probably wouldn't have to worry about it. However, because she also has a 12.5% chance of also having it that means any baby you two may have has a 6.3% chance of having this disease. True still doesn't seem like much but when the normal rate for a disease is more 1/1000 people or even greater, that 6% it's a HUGE leap.So moral- yes there are issues with this. Many royal families have been littered with genetic diseases like hemophilia because of cousins marrying. Many of these kinds of diseases can stay hidden for centuries so there is no real way of knowing if either of you are carrying them unless you get yourselves both checked for genetic diseases and meet with a genetic counselor. The only way remove all chances of genetic issues is to decide never, ever to have children or decide to fall in love with someone else.	post_7292901

post_7315217	Oct 11, 2011	1809109	None	None	Blood typing is all about the signals on a blood cell. While there are possibly hundreds of ways to type blood there are only two classifications that are used by the common masses. First there is ABO which is type A, type B, Type O or type AB. When someone has O, they express the geneotype O,O meaning they received one O allele or trait from each parent. So two parents with O blood can only give O alleles and therefore the resulting child could only show O type blood. (There are very very rare exceptions to this rule- but they do exist.)By "hr" do you mean the Rh factor, which typically expresses itself as Rh+ or Rh-? I forget exactly what the Rh stands for, but it is something else found on the blood. (Most cells in a human body have thousands of different signals and signs to identify them.) For instance I would say that I am A+, my husband is O+, and my ex flatmate AB-. That positive or negative sign is actually another genetic trait independent of the ABO and is the second way that blood is usually classified.    Now if someone is Rh + they may or may not also carry the - allele. Rh+ is dominant over Rh-. So if you are both O+, you could also carry O-. This means that your babies possible traits are OO/++ (25% chance); OO/+- (50% chance); or OO/-- (25% chance). (If only one of you is OO/+- than there is a 50/50 chance your children will be OO/++ or OO/+-; if you are both OO/++ or OO/-- than all children will be the same).Unfortunately, the Rh factor can cause pregnancy problems. My sister in law is actually +-, as is my brother which they only discovered on her most recent pregnancy (the Rh- allele hides itself so you never know for certain if you have it). Because of the +- traits it was possible to have a baby who was Rh-. This may have caused to my sil to miscarry a previous child at 6 months and it DID cause my niece to have to be in the ER for a few weeks after she was born. (My niece's blood started to fight the remaining maternal blood in her body and she became anemic and jaundiced and had problems for several months.) Unfortunately there is no way to know for certain if you have Rh+-, until this happens so you can't protect against it.However if your wife is OO/-- and is pregnant with a baby who is OO/+- it could be deadly for the mother. The Rh+ blood from the baby gets transferred to the mother via the umbilical cord and the mother's immune system attacks the fetus, usually resulting in a miscarriage. (Although sometimes it could make the mother very very sick.) So if you are O+ and the mother is O-, you need to see a doctor before getting pregnant. There are certain things they can do to keep both mother and baby safe.	post_7314240
post_7302362	Oct 07, 2011	1809109	None	None	The odds of having a child with Down Syndrome only increases as you get older. I don't remember the exact rates but I know it skyrockets after 35 and just increases. I also heard that having one child with Down Syndrome increases your rate of having another, although I don't know if it is statistically significant. Also, your age doesn't just put you at risk for Down Syndrome but also other genetic diseases caused by Trisomy (duplicated chromosomes) or mutations. I think it may also put you in a high risk group for additional complications during pregnancy. My advice would be to talk to an OB or a genetic counselor. They will really be able to give you a full picture of possible complications and how to best keep yourself healthy if you consider another pregnancy. Also, you might want to look into adoption. There are tons of children in need of a good home.	post_7302224

Check Candidiasis links to GAPS and autoimmune disease also.One doesn't need alcohol to get the same results as the body can make it    on it's own. lol!Some of the symptoms of Candidiasis:Chronic fatigue,tiredness (specially after meals)DepressionGastro Intestinal issues: bloating, gas, intestinal cramping, chronic diarrhea, constipation, heartburn and other.Allergies ( including both food,drink and environmental )Severe pre-menstrual syndrome (F)Impotence (M)Memory loss, mental fog, severe mood swings.Recurrent fungal infections like " jock itch "& athelete's footExtreme sensitivity to chemicals, perfumes, smoke etcVaginal or urinary infections and Prostatitis.Light headedness or drunken like symptoms after minimal alcohol, or certain food consumption.I suggest carb and sugar avoidance including artificial sugars and dairy.Consumption of extra virgin coconut oil, as it is a great antifungal, should help. Start with 2T daily for the first week.Visit the cocnut research center website for more info.If all this makes a difference,then it probably confirms the candiasis suspicion.Taking good quality probiotics will help restore your intestinal flora.Please let me know if this resonates well with you.If you have any questions please post again or pm me directly.Wish you well.NikoPSLook also into "oil pulling" (one of my top recommendations.)I personally do it every morning using extra virgin coconut oil.	post_8217995

post_8426854	Oct 16, 2012	1530171	669502	Ann1955	Hey Ann.I was introduced to "oil pulling" about 3 years ago and it has beena true blessing in my life.It originates from Ayurvedic medicine, a very old Hindu traditional healingsystem.Basically it involves taking a teaspoon of oil -I use coconut oil because of all its healing properties- and swishing well for 15-20 minutes each morningbefore breakfast, working the oil around the mouth just like mouthwash.After the swishing, you must spit the oil out completely and rinse the mouth very thoroughly.Through this process Billions of harmful bacteria and toxins, residing in the oral cavity (a very desirable location with almost perfect conditions for them)and the salivary glands, get excreted, leaving the mouth fresh, clean and healthy.It almost guarantees the elimination of any focal infections from the mouth,one of the very origins of systemic infections and disease -besides dental and gum infections- such as various forms of Arthritis.At your next dental appointment,your dentist, after you have done oil pulling for a few weeks will ask you, if you have been cheating on him/her,as your gums and teeth will be so much healthier and cleaner! lol!Wishing you well.Niko	post_8217995

post_8268255	Aug 24, 2012	1530171	1979418	jenphilly	Hi Jen. Welcome to the Alzheimer's Disease Community.You onto something very valid with your suspicions.Indeed, new research now discovered the brain produces insulin.Insulin will drop when consistently too much sugar is overloading and overworking the system.The amount actually of insulin drops dramatically as Alzheimer's advancesaccording to studies. There's neuronal apoptosis, due to    decrease of insulin growth factors, along with the insulin decrease, which leads to eventually serious memory impairment.Because diabetes and "brain diabetes" leading to Alzheimer's, are similar but separate conditions, they don't necessarily influence each other, but share probably some co-factors. Some people therefore may have diabetes but not the Alzheimer's, or vice versa, however, the risks of developing the other, are much greater, compared to the general population.I suspect that yeast overgrowth along with "brain hypoglycemia" can wreak havoc and exasperate Alzheimer's symptoms.One of the reasons, and this is based on my own personal conclusions,is why ketone based protocols are the most successful approaches so far, in dealing with Alzheimer's (prevention and treatment).In the most fundamental and basic form, this consists of adequate consumption of virgin coconut oil (VCO), as VCO can cross the blood -brain barrier and supply much needed energy to the brain when glucose uptake is restricted for various reasons.Also,VCO, being a significant antifungal agent- much more effective than prescription antifungal drugs- inhibits the neurotoxic effects of    yeast overgrowth conditions (plus alleviate or eliminate any other symptomscaused by yeast overgrowth conditions)Dementia and Alzheimer's may co-exist and with many overlapping symptoms and frequently exasperated by the same medications that are commonly prescribed for their so-called "treatment". Other meds taken for other conditions    can contribute to creating a potential "Molotov-like cocktail"! lol!Medications do have their place, nonetheless, the safety factor is grossly overrated, when prescribing considerations are employed, resulting inless than desired efficacy for arresting or treating the condition itself.In an overburdened medical system, facilities with limited resources,and time constraints - health care providers and family members alike-unfortunately the direction of Alzheimer's patient management and care,is downward- to state it politely!I have been through all this with my mom who passed on in May of this year.She had suffered also -besides her physical pain and limitations- traumatic brain injury, following a horrific accident caused by a drunken car driver a few years ago.TBI, PTSD, heart issues, Alzheimer's and paraplegic. What a combination!I found a "common space" where we communicated effectively, during my last trip (in greece) before she passed on. It was mainly non-verbal, and it reminded me of the silent spiritual communication that takes place in Ashrams, after the spiritual seekers have retreated in complete silence there for weeks.And it was very cathartic for both of us, as we could let go completely, of all the debris and all the nonsense that was surrounding us.I wish I could explain this better, but was not an intellectual process, butrather a spiritual one.We see in these conditions mostly the physical aspects, the symptoms, the "problems", of our loved ones, influencing us to forget and ignore their souls and their spirits along with or own souls and spirits.And this is where we can all seek and find comforting awareness.Thank you for posting and    for reading mine as well!!Blessings.Niko	post_8260335

post_7947777	May 12, 2012	2149993	2149993	bery120	sorry. hit the wrong button. Anyways, I have dealt with 2 loved ones that have alzheimers. My grandpa passed away due to complications of the disease but he lived for 10 years with the disease. My family opted to keep him at home and believe me it wasn't easy. He eventually had to go in a home for 2 years before he passed due to the fact that he was completely unable to help us take care of himself. He could not walk or talk and he needed more help than what we could do. However, we went and fed him everyday and went to see him everyday. You really have to be emotionally strong in order to care for someone with this disease. As the disease progresses they become mean and say hateful things things and you can't take it personally because they don't know what they are saying. Basically this disease makes them revert back to childhood and eventually back to a baby state. My husbands grandma is the other loved one with the disease and she is now starting to get worse. She still recognizes us and our children but her short term memory is fading. So she can't remember what you told her 5 minutes ago. The family has her on medicine to try and slow the process but as of yet there is no cure. They have chosen to struggle to pay people to be with her during the week and everyone takes turns on the weekend taking care of her. Including cooking for her, helping her use the restroom, bathing her, going shopping, and everything else that comes with caring for someone who can't do it anymore. I am very sorry to hear about your situation. Be strong and if you ever need to talk I am here. I hope I have shed some light on the situation. Take Care and God Bless!	post_7947654

They say she has toileting issues.    She doesn't understand how to go to the bathroom now.    She needs prompts for everything from sitting on the toilet, cleaning herself after and pulling up her pants.    They tell me she urinated on the floor of another resident, and that they have found waste in her bathroom in inappropriate    places (wastebasket, hamper, in towels, in the sink).    They put her on a two hour toileting schedule but still have concerns for the long term.    They also mention she is pouring her beverage into her food, and seems to be getting confused with how to feed herself.    We visited the skilled nursing facility at this facility and others in the community as well, most people seem so much more advanced than her, I fear she will give up if we move her. Even now at the Adult Care level she asks us to take her home whenever we visit.    She doesn't remember her home of 47 years just knows where she is isn't it.    Again, thank you, I don't wish this on anyone. It's a nightmare.	post_7887644

Most nursing homes only provide a thin cushion upon which to soften the seat.(24) Obtain a colorful velco snap-on bag for the patient's wheelchair to transport accessories. Write their name on it in magic marker.(25) If you go to an art supply store purchase a box of HB pencils or number 2. HB are better for drawing and shading. Plus a soft eraser. Get an art sharpener, which differs from a regular sharpener in that it only shaves the wood off and the artist sharpens the point with a piece of sandpaper or a little booklet with tiny sandpaper strips. As an alternative you can use sandpaper boards used to file fingernails. Get an inexpensive plastic box to hold art supplies. A selection of colored pens from a store such as staples are also nice. Everything should fit in the small box, which can go in the drawer next to the bed.(26) A box of pastel envelopes with colorful commemorative stamps from the post office. Let the patient stick them on. The post office has a wonderful selection of colored stamps if you ask. Plus a pad of lined stationary from an art store.	post_7973278

post_8283360	Aug 29, 2012	144586	None	None	I would recommend joining the American Geriatric Association, that has a membership fee, but lots of material available to the caregiver/supervisor. One of the biggest problems if the "chain-of-command". People only work well for one master and the universal practice of the commercial services is to have the aides report to a nurse, or worse yet to a nurse who reports to a "care coordinator". The "care coordinator" nonsense is new, and they will soon have to be licensed! A sinecure for social workers. And in New York, it will be the care coordinator who will be responsible for selecting and hiring the aides. There are many senior centers who have once-a-day home-delivered meals at a very modest rate (In New York $1.50 a day) that include a five-minute daily visit. A lot depends upon the type of disability of the elder person. My experience has been with the stroke-disabled super-elderly, those with difficulty swallowing, as well as those with pegs, which, contrary to popular belief are not necessarily painful nor do they mean a person cannot eat some meals (soft and special;ly prepared) normally.	post_7973278
post_8283395	Aug 29, 2012	144586	None	None	An aide will become something like a "member of the family" and this always results in a somewhat delicate supervisory relationship. Especially when the aides do not consider you a "doctor". As an example, many elderly people will suffer ocassional blackouts on the toilet when constipated. This is solved with good attention to keeping the bowels soft, but it sometimes happens. It means that a well-padded carpet must surround the portable toilet and an aide must remain with the patient throughout the process. If the patient faints the drill is to lie them down immediately, with the feet elevated six-to-ten inches and to make sure they have a good airway. And hold their hand and provide reassurance. This is one of the reasons one of my "rules of the road" was "use the toilet BEFORE breakfast and ensure they are well-hydrated. In any event, if you know what happened this is not necessarily a 911 call. Dragging a 100 year old woman to the hospital when this happens is not appropriate. Recovery will take place naturally. The drill is to avoid straining.. But the care services, to cover their legal buts will always call 911 if the patient faints, and if you are not there, there will be an unnecessary ambulance trip, an inappropriate intravenous line (paramedic protocol), and a waste of time, money, and a frightening episode for the little one.	post_7973278

post_8209184	Aug 05, 2012	None	None	None	That's tough when they have the emotional strength to act normal in a social setting but you know at home, they are far from normal. You could try keeping a journal of sorts: dates and notes on his behavior. Not just that he got angry but details that show his paranoia, confusion, anything way outside the norm. I've been doing that in the case of my mom. At the doctor's office she can be talkative and smile. That's easy to do for 15 minutes. It's harder to keep up that pretense for hours. So she's isolated herself from everyone.At some point, you may want to give the notes to his doctor, express your concern about what you're seeing. Then the doctor can decide what kind of testing should be done. They can't fix what they don't know.	post_8178926
post_8181616	Jul 27, 2012	187666	None	None	Being BPD alone is extremely difficult. It can distort his thinking and behavior in so many ways which also makes life difficult for you. I know since I grew up with a BPD mom. Add his health problems and constant pain and I'm not surprised he's stressed to the max.Has he been diagnosed with BPD? Is he compliant with his doctor's instructions on dealing with the migraines and IBS? My mom complains constantly about her health but is very uncooperative on taking her medication. It becomes a vicious cycle of pain, complaints, refusing treatment and more pain.Have you considered talking to a professional about all of this? Unfortunately you cannot fix his problems. You can care about him, love him but you can't fix him. For your own health it will help to talk to someone who can help you deal with this situation, teach you how to care but still keep some boundaries in place. It was only recently that I realized I couldn't deal with what was happening with my mom and I spoke to a counselor. What a huge help. My mom will never change but I feel healthier and better able to do what I can for her. I can't do it all but I can give her some encouragement and support without giving up my whole life.A book that's excellent to help you understand BPD is Stop Walking on Eggshells. It was the first book I read about this and it was so helpful.	post_8178926
post_8202888	Aug 03, 2012	2191415	187666	ireneo	Thank you for your reply. My boyfriend also has tendencies to be uncooperative in taking meds and refuses to go to the hospital because he "wants to remain in pain" despite complaining of being in pain, which is very conflicting. "chooses to remain in pain". It is concerning to me that your mom has not been able to treat it, is there no treatment for it? I heard that fish oil and dalectic behavior therapy helps but am aware of limited options. this is no longer the person he once was and it is concerning to be if he is unable to heal from it. He is very controlling and demanding to me which is not healthy for him nor fair for me but I often appease to him for sake of keeping him from getting riled up and destructive. This is enabling him at my expense but I dont know what else I can do to help the situation while keeping it stabilized.	post_8178926
post_8203493	Aug 03, 2012	187666	None	None	My mom, like most BPD people, doesn't believe she has a problem. She thinks everyone else is crazy, evil, rude, on and on. An example: while my Dad was laying there in a hospice bed at their home dying from cancer, she would stomp around complaining about how she had to do everything, that he just sat there waiting for her to wait on him like he was a king. See the distorted thinking?    Now years later she will say, "If I had known he was so sick, I would have been nicer to him."    Really?    I doubt it.Treatment for BPD is very difficult since it's hard to convince the person that they even have a problem. It seems most people with mental or personality problems also have some trouble taking medication. Either they take it and feel better (that's why they need it) then decide they're fine, don't need medications any more. Of course they spiral down again. Or like your boyfriend, they seem so comfortable in their misery they are afraid to change.I know you want to support your boyfriend, help him, encourage him. But this is way beyond your ability to fix. You can love him without enabling him. There is a difference. But again, I recommend you speak to someone who can teach you how to set boundaries for your sake and what works, what doesn't when communicating with a BPD person.Some people have to break away completely, go NC, non-com. Others like myself, feel a need to be there for that person. Taking care of my elderly BPD mom is not easy. I struggle all the time to keep myself emotionally healthy so I can assist her without being "hoovered", sucked into, her anger and drama. It's tough.So first help yourself. You have to be prepared and strong if you want to be there for him.	post_8178926
post_8206858	Aug 04, 2012	2191415	187666	ireneo	I think his symptoms maybe be beyond bpd into brain injury as his condition is much more extreme than your mothers. he was codependent but now he has become extremely possessive and obsessed with me. He is extremely paranoid haunted by childhood pain and relationship deception and harping on even trivial lies in addition to distorted thoughts and recently he has been experiencing auditory hallucinations. He is self destructive and suicidal and cannot handle demands and stress as it has resulted in new self inflicted concussions. whatever the case is that he needs desperate medical attention. In addition already lives a life of chronic physical pain. Publically he can appear normal emotionally stable and    cognitively functional but internally I fear he may be listing his mind.    there is so much darkness inside him that he fears he may be spiritually attacked.	post_8178926
post_8214318	Aug 07, 2012	2191415	187666	ireneo	My boyfriend is very reluctant about going to therapy and I think this is a symptom of bpd so it makes it very challenging. Is your mom seeing a therapist or on any kind of treatment? Has her condition ever improved? How do you handle her when she throws a fit about something that you refuse to appease to. Are they capable of learning from actions and taking responsibility? My bf also seems to be in denial or have an inability to deal with guilt and instead gets mad at the victim which is also very concerning. Is your mom extremely emotionally volatile, paranoid, unable to be alone, easily stress and irritable, destructive, self destructive, suicidal? I have read that these are symptoms of bpd as exhibited in my bf and is what makes my situation so much more dangerous and this is what makes my situation incredibly challenging.	post_8178926
post_8215196	Aug 07, 2012	187666	None	None	Getting him to agree to therapy is going to be next to impossible. A BPD person either feels they don't need therapy or they enjoy going in and charming the therapist, doing all they can to convince the T that they are a victim of others.My mom has always been volatile, not physically violent but verbally and emotionally abusive. Ah, the stories I could tell. . . .    but this isn't about me. Yes, when she makes a mistake, she insists it's someone else's fault. She's convinced someone is coming into the house and moving things around or taking them even though she has an alarm system and a barky dog. It goes on and on.The key is knowing that I can't make things better. I've tried my whole life to be good enough, to do things the way she wanted, to make her happy but it never works. Her anger was always there. I was afraid of her, felt that there was something wrong with me because it seemed everything I did was wrong. You can see that a lifetime of that is not healthy. So I had to find ways to detach myself from her manipulations and control. I still help her with things that she needs done. I do let her complain about how her life is worse than anyone else's. It does no good to point out the good parts of her life. But if she gets angry with me, I ignore it. I may even tell her that her anger disturbs me because I haven't done anything wrong.Please, learn coping tools for yourself. I know you care and want to help him. That's very kind of you. But unless he's willing to recognize his distorted thinking, he's not going to be helped.	post_8178926
post_8400163	Oct 07, 2012	3908302	187666	ireneo	I just read your comments regarding dealing with a loved one with bp, thank god! I have a gf who has pretty much drove me away with all her abuse. I don't know if i can stand anymore of it. She lost her career because she stopped her bp meds, began self medicating with narcotics, and diverted narcs while at work. She was a nurse like myself. Believe me she was a better nurse than i will ever be, but she believes her bs can get her by and that she is the victim! It's terrible. She lost her license 2 mths ago. Asked me to help her with her car payment while she tries to get a job as a pharmacy rep! I have not had the heart to tell her that this will probably never happen no matter how smart or crafty she! She started 3 weeks ago texting me that she would kill herself if i don't keep supporting her! I feel like i am the victim here. I loved her but l don't think anytime she tells me she loves me that it is real! She could just be saying this to pull me back in and use me? I don't initiate conversation with her anymore as i am worried as to what is real here, what is a delusion, and what is manipulation? I do care and don't look at her threats as total bs but i am floundering her on the edge. Do u know of any support groups that could help me or else i may have to go NC as u say. That would be hard to do because i do love her but in the end i must take care of myself. Any advise would be much appreciated. Thanks Nurse Chuck	post_8178926
post_8400861	Oct 08, 2012	187666	None	None	One thing to know, you can legally call 9-1-1 if a person claims they're going to kill themself. If that makes you feel uncomfortable, then call her bluff.Tell her you're worried about her when she talks that way. If she continues you will call 9-1-1 because you don't want to see her hurt.BPD folks are quite good at "hoovering." That is, they will push you away then say and do things to draw you back to them. My "nada", as a non-mother is called, is doing that to me right now. The past 4 days have been difficult with her making accusations against me. Now she wants to just drop it, pretend nothing happened. Nope. Long story.There is an excellent support group online that I visit. It's for non-BPD people that need to vent, share their stories, what's worked for them and what hasn't. And really, only someone who knows or lives with a BPD person really understands what you're going through. It's quite a supportive group.I can't give out the web address here because it's not allowed. Perhaps you might find one online yourself. Mine is WTO which stands for Welcome to Oz. LOL Obviously we know we're not in Kansas anymore when we're with them. It feels like a different reality. I do hope you can connect with a support group. And do read books on the subject.	post_8178926
post_8289163	Aug 31, 2012	3222955	None	None	PS> He is 85 Years old....... (Two of his doctors said, "Why did they encourage him to do this surgery? He is NOT going to get anything but worse in most every other physical realm of his being!"....) ........	post_8289159
post_8289811	Aug 31, 2012	144586	None	None	You have a terrible situation and I am somewhat at a loss to provide advice. Home care aides will not take abuse and will quit. You will not get part-time care under medicare if he curses or abuses them in any way.    This is the case with all agencies. In a nursing facility they will use a "chemical straitjacket" which will be a drug that will sedate him. Square one is to get legal advice and to get a guardianship arranged. There are various types of guardianships. I have been involved in several guardianship proceedings. You can do this yourself and it is not very expensive. It is going to be difficult to find a nursing home, let alone a nursing home nearby to accept him. Let me think on this.	post_8289159
post_8290439	Sep 01, 2012	3222955	144586	caregiver222	Thanks, SO MUCH, for taking the time to advise me, .... joyful news or not, haha.Honestly? He is really not abusive to anyone but my mother and me. When people show up, strangers? 95% of the time, it's "OH Hiiiiiii!", IF he's able to speak that day. On occasions, my mother will have Bible Studies or a friend will visit for a 'catch up' couple hours.... And as i said, SOME TIMES, he will start yelling, "You're my wife! You, you, you... Wife!"... Then tries to get up and walk to the room, which he really can't. He takes 5 minutes to get up to totally bent over standing position... THEN, to get to the end of the table, another 5 minutes.. By that time, he's COMPLETELY exhausted. SOME days, he can move SLIGHTLY better than this... But to be totally honest, those days are worse... he falls FAR more when he thinks he's 'getting better'... Which really is just a pause in the Spinal Stenosis inflammation or the Diabetic Neuropathy is not quite as bad. The swatting at ME is the only real time he's aggressive.. physically. BUT, he DOES in fact yell at her, as I said... Not constantly, just enough to be VERY disconcerting.When in a recovery/resting/nursing home after Open Heart Surgery.... they basically had to tie him down 90% of the time, unless we were there. That rope thing. He would NEVER stop, whenever awake, trying to get it off or have his bed neighbor to do so for him. He wasn't physically violent toward them, and I'm pretty sure the report on him from there would be moderately positive... Aside from the constant attempts to get out of restraints(who wouldn't, right?)..... Also remember, that at this time, he was actually walking with a walker(just months ago), almost solo, for around 200Feet or so..... Since being home, he's severely declined.... And as a matter of fact, they noticed it before he was leaving... "Moments of REALLY bad stability, etc."... Then, in Physical Therapy... I was told, "I just can't justify another 5 visits... it's so hard on him, one. He doesn't want to be here, two. And, well, he's gotten nothing but worse over the last 8 weeks. If you want to continue, we can... BUT, ... I    PERSONALLY don't think it's worth it. He has NO recall... I have to tell him everything over and over and even then, he wont follow commands at all, pretty much... or very rarely at least." ....... now all the doctors are basically telling me to "Mark, it's time to keep him comfortable".... WOW, is that ever easy to say, right? :(	post_8289159
post_8291770	Sep 01, 2012	144586	None	None	In the United States, to get medicare to pay for full-time nursing home care he will have to be down to under $1,500. They will then take his social security, and he will be permitted $50 cash a month, It sounds like you have been doing a great job. There are assisted living facilities, but he won't be able to get in without both a medical clearance and what they call a mobility clearance. There are electric recliners available with a certificate of necessity that will push him into a standing position. They cost about $1,400, but the reimbursement is only $600, If he is a veteran, the VA social workers might be able to suggest some options. You might want to try some Ambien. It is a curious drug. It is prescribed to help people go to sleep, but for some reason it helps some people with dementia and memory loss.	post_8289159
post_8309505	Sep 07, 2012	3222955	144586	caregiver222	Hey there, .....First off, PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR THIS MANIC, LONGGGG, UPCOMING MESSAGE? :) lol..... Secondly, but more importantly, ....THANKS, AGAIN, for just honestly and sympathetically answering me, Caregiver222:)Well, ...... we(the entire family and Living Trust Agent and some Financial Family People) all met, with my mother present, ....and I gotta tell ya... THEY WERE WORRIED instantly, just SEEING my mother. She was nodding out, right there, at 7:30, eyes bloodshot beyond the norm by FAR... etc. Then hearing the full story, ...these people/family ALL quickly jumped in and said, "Mom,.......THIS IS NOT right to continue to do this to yourself, FIRST OF ALL... But VERY important, as well, is the fact that you just can't ask your son to care for his stepfather to this extent any longer... I DO THIS type finance for families... And it tears them apart all the time.. But WORSE, it KILLS THEM, high percentage... and I have to be honest.... You look VERY unhealthy/exhausted and overwhelmed... And your son is half your age and doesn't look much better. He CAN NOT do this another day, 18 hours a day either helping or on call, after 9 months straight! We have to find a solution, RIGHT NOW, or at least start the process... HE HAS TO be placed somewhere, ASAP!".........Of course, as you know, cargiver222.... that's always easy to say... But with all these minds at work, ... and some of them working in this field to one extent... we might have figured some things out(At least an A, B and C avenue map out to try and get the feelers out there RIGHT AWAY.A. (Which seemed to be the most likely path that everyone wants to take... )>>> Take him to the ER when he's wanting to be checked/in a panic about the pain and inability to walk, etc..... Tell them the truth, .."He's falling ALL THE TIME, and you can't turn your back on him for a second. My mother is TOTALLY incapable of lifting him off the floor, and to be honest, can't really be entrusted with the 'full duties' of caring for him without someone there..... And I'm spent. He's a danger to himself, claims he's dying and is VERY manic with some demented behavior. He needs to be evaluated,... and his Primary Care Physician, Neurologist and the Psychologist who recently visited feel that he is desperately in need of 24 Hour skilled care."..... We might have to go to the Neurologist first, to get STATEMENTS, LITERALLY, in hand..... But they can all visually observe him for 5 minutes and see all they need to know in regards to at least one of the points... which is; HE IS NOT ABLE TO CARE FOR HIMSELF/NOT ABLE TO CHECK HIS BLOOD SUGAR ANYMORE, WHICH HE DID FOR 30 YEARS/NOT ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET 6 INCHES TO THE BEDSIDE/COUCH-SIDE TOILET WITHOUT LOTS OF HELP.... which is actually around 20-30 times a day on average!He's been repeating himself.... Like saying, "I, I, I, I, I, (around 20 times), I need 10 dollars"..... We ask, "For what?", ..... He answers, "I, I, I, I, I,, need 10 Dollars", ... finally getting out of him, that "he needs 10 dollars for a haircut".... And when we do get that out, he repeated it for about an hour. So I finally spoke very clearly to him and said, "Hey, I hear ya... You want 10$ for a haircut at that salon we go to? Don't worry, I'll cut your hair again".... He kept at me on the "10 dollars, 10 dollars" for a while.... But eventually he gave up and said, "Ok, you fix?".... I said, "YEP", and I did, that day, which is important... Cuz when it comes back, a controlling person like him is going to be MORE AND MORE INSISTENT on it until you either meet their request or come to a compromise(I AM NOT about to take him to a Salon any more... He's VERY difficult to manage and get to the car and get out and get in the barber chair and ..... My back is ALREADY INJURED with 4 Herniated Discs that I manage to keep under check... but WOW, this is pushing it. Taking him to the movies? SAME THING... NEVER again... He's wanting to get up and pee after 30 minutes and will NOT stop trying to get up, etc.... This REALLY upsets my mom....But she just wont accept that he's both a. Dimented and (b.) often very much passive aggressive.To be continued............	post_8289159
post_8309506	Sep 07, 2012	3222955	144586	caregiver222	Cont.,................Last night, I went in to his room for the 5th time, around 3:30 AM, because I KNEW I'd heard something.... He had gotten up and somewhat half crawled around the bed, turned on the light on the way and when i came in, was looking for something... He couldn't articulate it... and at 330am... I interrupted him and quietly but firmly said, "Sir, ... I am not going to look for something at 330am... and this is VERY dangerous... You can NOT get up and walk around the room like this... You can hardly stand, and when I got here, you were already going down to one knee, on the opposite side of the bed.... If you get out of bed again, I and fall, I will have to call 911 to come and pick you up... They will probably want to take you to the hospital for a few days to check you out, because you're not listening to basic safety boundaries, at ALL!".... He got up RIGHT THEN AND THERE and was trying to continue his search... So I pulled him gently back into bed, told him, "SIR? I wasn't kidding.... You will not stay here in your own room through the night if you can not stay in bed and try to get some sleep. I WILL take you to the Hospital, NEXT TIME that you get up beyond using the toilet."... He stopped his adventures.. BUT, this morning, was right back at searching for something,... by now he can't explain what it is(speech is so bad)....The other night, he quietly crept out of bed and 3 times, from 12am to 4:30am wound up on the floor... By the time i got there, he had urinated all over the floor and was laying in in... I cleaned him up each time, got him into bed, and told him, "Just call me"... "Ok" he said,.... each time He wound up on the floor. The 3rd time, I said, "This is REALLY scary, Sir... you need to stay in bed", while I was replacing the pee pads on the floor for the 3rd time, I feel something on my head... I look up and his foot is coming on down on me... I said, "WHAT are you DOING?".... "I, I, I, I, I, I,.............got to peepee"...... (Just that day, when I turned my back to use the restroom for 2 minutes, I came back and he was over the porta-potty SIDEWAYS, ... trying to get his diaper off his foot... peeing on the floor and seat top... YES, with his rump facing one handle and his crotch facing the other handle... THAT TYPE OF STANCE!).......Honestly, Caregiver222? >>> I think I am the type of person that's ALWAYS tried to 'SAVE' people(including my mom, I suppose, in a sense, pertaining to the risk all this puts her at)... even past when I should... I've grown over the years to the point that I HAVE GREAT EASE in setting my boundaries and I will NOT enable people... BUT, I wasn't sure until that very moment, 100%, that NOT ONLY am I DONE with this... I realized, as my heart raced to around 140bpm..... "I'D BETTER NOT do this another day without having SOME TYPE OF HOPE for relief".... I realize I AM NOT "helping" my mother, any longer, by staying here and putting my own health at risk... Nor by 'lengthening' his stay here, and subsequently furthering the ''signs of wear" upon here via trying to fill in the gap that I can't fulfill(I can't do this 24 hours a day, 9 months straight, obviously... So for 6 hours or so.. she's on her own, and it's KILLING HER, quickly! Not forg. to mention... 'When HE KNOWS I'm sleeping or gone... he IMMEDIATELY turns into 'GO-GO-JONNY!'>> CONSTANTLY trying to get up, knowing that she can't pick him up if he falls, etc., etc., etc.)Therein; It seems that my only choice is to MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN that will allow her to not have to live on food stamps and tiny bits of aid, barely able to pay the bills(they'll take all his Social Security and Pension.... Which will DRAMATICALLY reduce her 'comforts', and she'd have to get rid of Cable TV/HER FAVORITE THING, and internet, her other things, and basically begin to really live hand to mouth)... SO, as I said, we've figured out, for the most part, that WHAT LITTLE MONEY she/they do have saved?.... IT CAN NOT be touched. Just have some more fine tuning to do.. Then offer the opportunity to his children to take over at least 66%(otherwise I WILL leave) and they'd have to do it for NO PAY(or pay out of pocket for care), period.... If ANYONE is getting paid, it would have been me... BUT, that would have been very difficult to achieve through Medical/would have required us to drop medicare/would have made the transition to a 'skilled nursing facility' VERY MUCH more difficult......... BTW, I wont say I know the hearts of his children... That's not my job/right to judge.... BUT I CAN judge the Character and level of Sacrifice they've offered... and IT'S NOTHING.. Nor has even his son, who's 6 miles away or so, bothered to come more than 6 times in 9 months... FOR A TOTAL OF 4 HOURS MAYBE?(one time he took him with him to his house/my stepfathers old house/ ......and yeah, that's not happened since for around 5 months). I doubt they're likely to come down and take over for me... Especially when they find out they will GET NOTHING for their time... That they'll actually have to do it out of the love of their father/kindness of their hearts >.< ....Not sure if it's ok to ask.... BUT PLEASE, PLEASE PRAY for a QUICK AS POSSIBLE solution to this problem... Otherwise, I'd have to leave and basically be homeless in order to FORCE THEIR HAND! I WILL, if it will save my mothers life/add years to it possibly... BUT; Why should I, if I don't have to? I am NOT OBLIGATED to care for him every day for years... And I did so with a willing heart, not asking for anything... But at this point, this is slowly killing me and I can't go on any longer. Bottom line, 'HE'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER, not likely, and HE WILL get worse at times and more and more needy... As that happens, my mother will draw closer, MUCH FASTER, to a premature demise... And I CAN NOT allow that, period!	post_8289159
post_8309690	Sep 07, 2012	144586	None	None	There is another possible answer. That is to involve adult protective services. They will visit and order a psychiatric evaluation which will take place in the home by a visiting psychiatrist. That may provide a recommendation for nursing home care.	post_8289159
post_8309695	Sep 07, 2012	144586	None	None	Wandering around aimlessly in the middle of the night is a hallmark of dementia. Typically the patient struggles to get out of bed, makes it to the other side of the room and suddenly becomes puzzled, not remembering why they got up, and then falls and calls for help. With a patient I was caring for this would happen every fifteen minutes.	post_8289159
post_8310496	Sep 07, 2012	3222955	None	None	Oh my goodness! Every 15 minutes? Wow, ...... that's incredible!Thanks for not razzing me for ranting, caregiver222. It's all factual, nothing bolstered... In fact, I've not even shared the HALF of it... BUT, at this point, I don't think that's necessary... I'm glad I didn't lose you completely here with the tangents other than 'I NEED THIS'! lol.Hmmmm, Adult Protective Services, eh? That can be tricky, right? I mean, ... he doesn't always seem so bad, as odd as that sounds. Today, while I was out doing errands, apparently he walked almost all the way to the room(holding on to things the whole way, but nonetheless).... BUT, then after a short period of him being more alert and physically more capable ... he slips back into being unable to walk and that seems to go hand in hand with more symptoms of dementia.Last night, he knew what he wanted to find... He just couldn't get it out in speech. Repetitive "I, I, I, has, i has, i has, i has", ....kinda thing. I video taped this and a few other 'DANGEROUS' moments recently.... Just placing the camera down to film while I spoke with him and tried to reason with him a lil bit(VERY useless :(     )..... Some times, the speech and then gazing off at the TV in mid sentence and then coming back to trying to spit it out comes back... Others he's repeating something that 'HE WANTS, RIGHT NOW!'... I'm just not sure how much is dementia and how much is the fact that his 'demanding/entitled' nature hasn't left... it's increased, while his ability has decreased. Either way, there are CLEARLY signs of Dementia. Also, as I think I said... some days, he has NO CLUE what year/the prez/date/etc it is... Just shrugs his shoulders... Others, he seems to do better, like Yesterday at the eye doctor, where he read off all the letters to the lady. (do you find that dementia comes and goes? Bad days and good? My friends an RN and says it's very common.. They'll be great one visit, then terrible the next... Just goofy smile or frown and unable to speak very well, etc.)... I suppose he could be having more mini strokes too.. They said that's very common.Do you find that when they're seemingly 'doing better', they get into FAR more trouble and are TEN TIMES the work than when they're a mess? When a mess, he just wants to sleep all the time and doesn't get up as often. When 'doing better', he seems FAR more restless and refuses to sit still for 10 minutes. YET; Even when 'doing better', he seems to spend around 12Hours in bed through the night(along with constantly getting up and down) and then naps for around 2-4 hours a day. That's so unlike him... AND, the Heart Doctor does NOT WANT him lying around.... But then, he doesn't have to deal with him if you don't let him...

post_8133521	Jul 12, 2012	187666	None	None	I'm collecting information now (phone numbers and general info) on agencies that can provide some in-home care for my mom. From what I've read, going over the list about "should this person still be at home?" she should NOT still be living alone. So I'm going to start with small steps. I hope to find someone to come in once a week to help her with errands, medications, cleaning up. She recently mentioned this herself. Mostly I think she wants company; she's alienated all her neighbors.My question: how do you know if the person you hire is really there to help or whether they want to weasel in on the elderly person's affections and bank account? I've heard of this happening so frequently that I'm more than a bit concerned.I do spend 2 days a week with my mom, call her at least twice a week as well, more often than that lately because she's so fearful of everything. But more than house cleaning and running errands, I think she needs more company.	post_8131676
post_8134667	Jul 12, 2012	144586	None	None	That is a very difficult question to answer, ireneo, In my own experience the problem was never dishonesty. It was a lack of common sense and conscientiousness. In order to obtain insurance reimbursement one is almost forced to hire through an agency. Worse, under some new state regulations under the new Obamacare, you may no longer be able to hire aides directly, but must employ a "care supervisor" (who will choose and "supervise" the aides), a new layer of bureaucracy, expense,    and unnecessary licensing. The perfect solution to which no known problem exists. The issue of "needing more company" is most important. The sense of "affect", or caring for another human being is, apparently, not genetically distributed in equal amounts. For different people In have hired aides from agencies (never ever satisfactory), hired sand trained them myself (best), and had an ocasional live-in. The live-in was for three months. He was an elderly physician from Australia recovering from heart surgery, agreeing to provide medical help and companionship in return for room and board. Another "live-in" was a European nursing student who was in the United States for six months of training. She also provided companionship in return for room and board.    In these cases the number of hours they were to devote to the patient were spelled out clearly. I also had great sucess with several Korean girls, who I hired to come over and take my little camper out to the park and play with her. I hired these girls because I was totally upset at the ones sent over by the agency. These girls were wonderful and sang songs and prayed and laughed. I obtained them through a Korean pastor. They had immigration issues and would only work off the books. That proved to be an issue. The only problem was that they tended to cook inedible (understatement!) meals. In the Korean (and asian cultures) elderly people are revered and worshipped. This proved to be true. They disappeared when they found American husbands. It takes patience to find the right help-person, and observation and supervision. They are out there. I finally ended up with four aides who were absolutely positively wonderful in all respects. That is, after thirty-seven of them went through the meat grinder.	post_8131676
post_8135091	Jul 12, 2012	187666	None	None	Looks like I have my work cut out for me. At this stage I spend more energy and time with my mom than I do with my own grown children and grandkids who live only 5 minutes away while mom is 30 minutes away and across the border. But dear old mom still expects more.Today she was complaining that people ignore the elderly and she told her doctor that she had no family to help her. Somehow I managed to keep my mouth shut but I'm sure steam was coming out my ears. She thinks as people get older, all the family should be parading in and out day and night to care for the senior. I calmly told her that in this mobile society I don't think people live close enough to do that. She still expects it though. Thus I'm willing to go through all the hoops to find some extra companionship for her.	post_8131676
post_8135272	Jul 12, 2012	144586	None	None	Finding someone to assist is a somewhat labor-intensive operation, but it is possible. To evaluate I would take the girl out with my little one and explain that I wanted them to make her really have a good time, and then excuse myself and tell them I would be back in an hour or two. I would then go over the hill and observe with tasco binoculars. A beautiful 33 year old Korean girl named Sua took my little one to a pond where there were ducks, and I could see her point to the ducks and laugh, then kneel down next to my little one, hold and kiss her hand and sing songs to her and brush her hair for an hour. So people exist who can be very worthwhile. I hated to lose her, but she got a full time job at a doctor's office and I couldn't use her more than a few hours.	post_8131676
post_8137774	Jul 13, 2012	144586	None	None	I have hired girls to be "companions" for several elderly people and find things work out best when there is no "hourly" fee, but a "flat" rate for up to ten hours for two weeks. Bi-monthly. These were not certified "aides". Circa 2012 you can do quite well for ten dollars an hour or a hundred dollars cash for a ten hour "flat".    Invariably the girls ended up spending far more time that ten hours. If you don't agree on a "flat" you will be involved in aggravating niggly-piggly over hours worked every week. Arghh! ("I came in at seven-ten and left at nine sixteen....how many minutes is that") Let the girls keep their own hours. I would pay them bus fare and the cost of snacks (usually tea, coffee, pastries and juice). I would reimburse reasonable expenses without question. They enjoyed watching television and would often spend an additional eight hours watching movies with the patient. I have hired agency girls on 12 hour shifts and others on a semi-live in basis of two or three days duration. On the books.    The problem with the 12 hour shifts was that the aides would come in from another job and in the morning leave for another job. My standing rule was that "duty" on a 12 hour shift would be exactly that. I prohibited second jobs where the aide would work either before or after a shift. Trust me on this one.    If you don't insist on this they will consider the shift to be "sleep and rest time". Most of the agency hires were useless as a screen door on a submarine, with one exception. Many spoke no known language. For the "live-ins" on two or three day shifts I would spell them for a minimum of three to four hours during every day and an hour at night. They would have to buy outside supplies at times and I would designate one girl to do so on her own time, estimating four man-hours (or girl-hours) a month and give that person an extra $40 cash to pay for this. I would also give the live-ins a ten dollar daily meal allowance (for themselves) and usually cook them lunch (an extra one). I would prepare the meals myself and store them in the refrigerator to be microwaved. I have had terrible experiences with so-called "clean teams". I would divide the patient's room into four quadrants and "G.I." one quadrant every day.	post_8131676
post_8140001	Jul 14, 2012	144586	None	None	The professional care services have one advantage if your loved one requires 24/7 care. That is, they always have someone from their pool available to "fill-in" if an aide cannot be in for work. The downside is that the aides (in general) do not get paid for sick days and will show up with the flu, coughing and sneezing, so as not to miss a days work. In general, their aides arrived with the common sense of a moth. My little one required special feeding (she had dysphagia) and the fill-in aides invariably failed the "feeding" test. And the service would not call me if there was a fill-in. I would always offer to pay aides their salaries for three days if they had to stay home because of illness. For a while I engaged the services of what is alleged to be "the largest and best provider of senior aids in the United States", founded by a late physician who "wrote a book on geriatric care", with a web page chock full of testimonials. I would describe my experience with this care providing service (their website shows smiling aides in bright uniforms and laughing seniors in wheelchairs) as "A nightmare on Elm Street". There was the aide who deliberately forced boiling hot soup down the throat of my little one (true) because she was "mad", the other aide who showed up with the flu and coughed in my little one's face, then spit yellow flem(phlegm)on her finger and forced it into her mouth, the other one I fired who deliberately threw away her favorite stuffed animal (Inez cried for days). My experiences with them upset me to this day. Then they had a male supervisor who would have ended up in a duel with me had it been 1810. So if nothing else it proves that internet web sites are no guide to the care these people can provide. I eventually worked out a back-up plan for instances where no aide was available. I engaged the services of a church-non-profit who ran a nearby clinic several blocks away with nurses who agreed I could wheel my little one over in an emergency and they would park her in an air-conditioned patient room to watch television and feed her. For a few dollars one of their aides agreed to come over and pick her up, if necessary.	post_8131676

There are different recipes. You can use Tobasco sauce instead of cayenne pepper. Basically two tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon, 2 tablespoons of natural maple syrup and 1/10 teaspoon of cayenne pepper (or a few drops of hot sauce to taste), in eight ounces of warm water. Stir thoroughly and then chill. Serve in the little two-ounce plastic cups. This is especially helpful for those with thin-liquid dysphagia. The hot sauce helps trigger the swallow reflex.	post_8125152
post_8130385	Jul 11, 2012	144586	None	None	I have nothing bad to say about the commercial nutritional drinks, except to say that usually you can do a little better. Many have a somewhat "chemical" taste. In a home-care scenario the system works best when the attendant shows up and beverages are readily available, pre-made and stored in a large refrigerator. This should be done by a family member who has been designated the task. The beverages are purchased and prepared without involving the aides. Trust me on this one.    This means that someone must insure there is an appropriate inventory available. At least one shift each day should perform an inventory and be in contact by telephone with a responsible person to report shortfalls.    If there is thin-liquid dysphagia present you can add a bit of thickening agent (available at drugstores) to all thin liquids. Since the attendant may have a different idea of how thick the solution should be it is best you do this yourself.    I would store the beverages in 32 ounce Tropicana glass containers (They can be sterilized easily - plastic cannot) in a large family refrigerator. The orange juice with "lots of pulp" works best with elderly patients with thin-liquid dysphagia because the pulp promotes swallowing. All the attendant had to do was to open the door. I would supplement the 32 ounce orange juice with 2 grams (2000mg) of vitamin C, in crystaline form. The crystaline form is the only kind that readily dissolves. That provides about 62 mg per ounce of Vitamin C. Be very careful in providing too much vitamin C to an elderly patient because in addition to being an anti-oxidant C is a diuretic, and induces urination. If you do, insure that during that period hydration of the patient is carefully monitored. Tomato juice in metal cans was immediately transferred to a glass container, lemon juice and a few drops of tobasco aded, and the container shaken and returned to the refrigerator. I am a fan of malted milk powder, available in plain and chocolate. It makes an excellent shake with bananna, a cube or two of ice milk and maple syrup. It is expensive, but I always liked maple syrup as a sweetener. Sometimes I would use cane sugar. That means a small blender must be purchased. And ice-cubes kept available. I would usually flavor the milk with a few drops of vanilla or maple syrup. A chocolate "egg-cream" is a real treat, made from seltzer and chocolate milk. I would avoid soda, except on a special ocasion, such as a birthday.	post_8125152
post_8130452	Jul 11, 2012	144586	None	None	There are also a few companies that sell pre-thickened fluids for those with swallowing difficulties, including thickened-water and thickened-coffee. You can find the source on the internet. They are all excellent, but I preferred to do the thickening myself. You can also purchase packets of powder that produce drinks with flavored electrolytes in many health food stores. I haven't mentioned warm beverages, such as broth and soup. When serving such beverages I also used the small cups and followed the "two-cup" rule. Thus a two or three-ounce cup of chicken broth and a two to three-ounce cup of split pea soup. Soup consumed is logged in the same manner as any other liquid. Whether you have someone helping you for four hours a day, twelve hours or have 24/7 care for your loved one one of the primary duties is not to have the floow swept. That duty is to insure hydration. At the brginning of the shift beverages should be offered and available, preferably on a tray placed front of the patient within a forty-degree line of their head. Not on an inaccessible table at the side of the chair or bed. The rule is "in view at all times".At the end of the shift there is a logged record of liquid consumed. I cannot emphazize how important this is. If there was a table extension I would put the beverage on a tray with an edge to prevent mess if the cup tipped. The cup of liquid should be offered to the patient, but the patient should take the cup and take the drink. This is a way to prevent laranygospasm when too much liquid goes down and ends up in the trachea. When going outside with the wheelchair to the park I always kept two small vaccuum flasks filled with different beverages and a supply of the small plasticn cups. Upon arrival at a destination the first thing after getting set up should be to offer a beverage to the patient. The paid caretakers should be instructed in this drill and it be made part of "Standard Operating Procedure".	post_8125152
post_8130981	Jul 11, 2012	144586	None	None	Bear in mind the elderly I have cared for with have been very old and enfeebled. With a younger patient the problem may not be as severe. The main problem is that the "sense of thirst" tends to disappear in the 90's. They have to be encouraged to drink. The norms established for hydration of younger people don't apply. I see ninety ounces of fluid recommended for a hundred pound female. In an elderly patient you are lucky to get 28-32 ounces in them in the course of a day, even if you try youe best. Lack of hydration causes bowel impaction and increases the probability of a stroke, among other problems. So it is extremely important. One of my little girls is a hundred and eight years old. The super-elderly require care that is beyond the abilities of the average run-of-the-mill caregiver. And it is labor-intensive care. My little pal Claudine died a month ago because of a lack of that care. Care that I wasn't around to provide because I was in the hospital. Even the best nursing homes are understaffed. If you can afford it and cannot do so yourself, it is worthwhile to supplement nursing home care with someone else coming in to assist, especially during the evening feeding time, with your loved one.	post_8125152
post_8131521	Jul 11, 2012	187666	None	None	Wonderful information on hydration and how to encourage the older folks to drink. My mom, 83, tends to live on Pepsi and Sierra Mist. It drives me nuts. She tells me she can't drink water because it "goes straight through" and within seconds she swears she has to run to the bathroom. But she'll down 16 oz of Pepsi and never piddle a drop. Well, that lovely reasoning goes with all her other biologic impossibilities. I only spend 2 days a week with her so whatever happens is beyond my control at this stage.	post_8125152

I semi-scolded my daughter when she was in the hospital because she wasn't eating the meals they brought in; her husband was scarfing them up (he's a bit of a garbage disposal anyway). I told her they track her food intake to make sure she's getting what she needs after surgery. Duh!	post_8120953
post_8121361	Jul 08, 2012	144586	None	None	Over the years I fired thirty-seven of them. I eventually sought out educated individuals with advanced degrees (immigrants) from Georgia (the Nation, not the State) with no certification whatsoever who had an interest in caring and trained them myself. I gave them CME every day (continueing medical education), assigned them readings, and followed the training curriculum used for State Certification. This was conducted during a supervisory visit to each shift. I had 24 hour coverage. The universe of people who become health care aids, and the certification requirements guarantee problems. Until recently, in my state they didn't even have to be fingerprinted or subject to a police check. The fact they show up from an agency dressed in a nurse costume does not guarantee they will perform satisfactorily. That being said I do not wish to condemn every person working in such a position. I do maintain that they have to be supervised, and that is difficult. After a while they become sort of part of the family. The rule is "Be thou familiar, but not vulgar". Another problem exists when they are supervised by a nurse from an agency or a "care supervisor". A person can only have one master. And in such a situation every little thing gets blown out of proportion. When I ended up hiring them myself directly I eliminated this problem. In nursing homes, no matter what they say, they don't track food intake or hydration. It's a big problem.	post_8120953

He was trained to move them properly from bed to chair to bathroom, etc. He knows how to change sheets, use pillows and such to avoid bed sores. And yes, he had a background check in order to do this. And he's just a volunteer. I would think aides who are being paid for the position would be trained and checked at least this much.

My Dad had hospice care when he was dying and he was only 79. The hospice team members were well trained and did a wonderful job. My husband is now a hospice volunteer and he's gone through intensive training and has to be up to date on all his vaccines. He's been trained on how to deal with body waste and fluids.

post_8079634	Jun 24, 2012	144586	None	None	I had a lot of problems with health care aids taking care of someone and I ended up firing thirty-nine of them (count-em!). There are a lot of part 19 scams and one of them is the "one hour visit". State law usually requires a minimum of a four hour block of care. Not an hour. The agencies commit fraud by billing from the time the person is supposed to leave the agency headquarters, which may be an hour or two away from the place of home care. In point of fact they schedule several people in close proximity, and the aid goes from one client to the other, all being billed for non-existent travel. I advise you to get the bills for every day an aide has been there for an hour. Then travel to the local F.B.I. office and ask to speak to the "qui tam" officer. It may be difficult at the F.B.I. office to find an adult to speak with (my experience) but keep trying. There is now an agent designated in every office to deal with medicaid/medicare fraud. If it turns out they have been defrauding 1,000 clients and are forced to remit money - YOU get a percentage of the money for having discovered and reported the fraud.	post_7942578

"Do you want me to help with writing the checks for the bills or do you want to do it?" And I admit, some choices she makes are not ideal but if they cause no harm,    l let her do it anyway.

post_7947195	May 12, 2012	144586	None	None	Most assisted living facilities require three forms filled out by different physicians. One is the mobility assessment form. How well they can (a) walk and (b) climb stairs (c) propensity to fall.    And whether the patient requires a walker, wheelchair or cane. The second is general health. Medications especially. Some facilities do not have nursing staff certified to provide narcotics, for example. The third is a psychiatric evaluation. They do not want disruptive patients. (This is also something that many nursing homes consider when applying) In addition some facilities (requirements vary) will not take a patient who requires a wheelchair, however once the patient is in the facility, they will permit he/she to stay. Before taking a loved one to go for an interview make sure you have your ducks in order and no adverse information that could affect admission.	post_7845987
post_7958125	May 16, 2012	187666	144586	caregiver222	That's excellent information. I know she would flunk the mobility test. Partly because she has trouble walking since she refused to go to physical therapy any more. And partly because she exaggerates her helplessness when in public. She loves to have people watch her, help her and pat her on the back. At home she does quite well, vacuuming, bending over and picking up her 15 lb dog, lifting boxes out of the closet.As for meds, they are pretty standard for cholesterol and BP.Her attitude: she can be so funny and charming in public if someone's willing to talk to her. Otherwise, she's extremely critical and rude, complains about everything, insists that she's the only one who has problems. That gets tiring.I'll keep all this in mind if she ever reaches the point of needing care. She's independent enough but expects me to do so many things she could do for herself.	post_7845987

Some of these falls were real, however she admitted "faking" falls when she decided the staff were not paying her close enough attention! When you mentioned "she loves to have people watch her, help her, and pat her on the back", you are describing the patient I know to a "T". Cholesterol meds have positives and negatives. Sometimes they are absolutely positively needed, but other times their prescription is questionable. Remember that memory is preserved in cholesterol depositions and inappropriate prescription of drugs that dissolve cholesterol may affect memory.	post_7845987
post_8054472	Jun 16, 2012	187666	144586	caregiver222	I didn't know that about cholesterol. I suppose it's a balancing act (no pun intended) for the elderly: to have enough for brain function but not so much that it clogs arteries. Contrary to what she says, she has no heart problems so I'm not sure why she has the statins.I noticed she has bottles of meds backed up (multiple bottles of the same med). She blames Express Scripts for sending them too often. I checked the dates and they send them on time according to her prescription. It looks like she's not taking most of her meds anyway.She has Zoloft but only takes it when she feels bad, treats it like it's an aspirin. Take one and feel better in 15 minutes. I tried to explain that it doesn't work that way but she doesn't get it.I did go to a counselor for help. She gave me some more "tools" to help me deal with the emotional side of this, a couple books to read and she's available whenever I need a tune-up.    :-)    It doesn't change my mom but it's helping me cope.	post_7845987

post_8062737	Jun 19, 2012	144586	None	None	Entry into a good "assisted-living" facility is best accomplished with "massage". That is to say a little help by someone in vouching for the person going in and assuring the staff they will not cause trouble.    Ordinarily this involves a referral by a social worker. You have to be careful you don't have one that "damns with faint praise". Eventually there is a one-to-one interview with the prospective tenant. If this is a relative, meet with them beforehand to prepare a little "monologue" and preferably accompany them to the interview. Bear in mind that many patients who would benefit from assisted-living have mild dementia. They may be asked who the president and vice president are, who is running for office, and the year and date. Recently a patient I was helping was denied admission because she could not name the president, vice president or the year. I had been with her for a time and she had extremely short-term memory, but was otherwise a good candidate. She blew the interview.    During the interview they must be careful about what they say. This is not a time for "stream-of-consciousness" and a recitation of all their problems. If you have the time "play-act" with being the interviewer. Make sure they dress appropriately. This was another issue with the patient was rejected. She insisted on wearing her somewhat wrinkled and soiled clothing and the social worker who accompanied her did not insist on her changing. Most especially, avoid them mentioning violence, suicide, or "problems" they may have had with neighbors. Tell them to imagine they are going to interview for a part in a movie and they must appear, happy, contented, have no real problems - even if they do - (except shopping alone - that's something they can emphasize). Have in hand a medical proxy and the mobility, medical and psychiatric clearance sheets. The psychiatric clearance is tricky, because even with a medical proxy you may not be permitted to have access to this document. The "so-called" confidential psychiatric clearance may blindside them and prevent them from even being considered for many nursing homes. You will never know the reason.    Typically a patient gets blackballed because they have a confrontation with some nasty hospital or rehab home staff member which results in them flailing at them with a weaklened 90 year old hand. This get's marked down as an "assault on staff". I have been through this drill with several geriatric patients and I speak truth.    If you anticipate a problem, have an arrangement with a private psychiatrist to meet with them and provide you with the clearance.	post_7845987
post_8066414	Jun 20, 2012	187666	None	None	I never knew it was so difficult to get help for the elderly. It's very discouraging to know that homes created to care for the seniors are so **** picky. They want the easy ones, the people that will just sit there and cause no trouble. Where does that leave the people like my mom that complain constantly, wander around trying to remember the basics of living and converse only in a negative "stream of consciousness" style? I used to try to follow her dialogue, help fill in the blanks when she would forget what she was saying but I just shrug my shoulders now.And what about seniors that smoke a lot, have a pet? What happens to them?I am just so tired of trying to cope with this. My husband is feeling the pressure, my kids keep asking to spend time with us. Normally I love being around them but it's beginning to feel like another obligation. I survive (that's how it feels) the visits with my mom but it's still taking a toll on me.	post_7845987
post_8067917	Jun 20, 2012	144586	None	None	Some nursing homes permit smoking, even where the home is filled with signs and the state prohibits smoking. They tend to keep this policy quiet because it isn't very politically correct. I think this is a good idea. In one home I know there is a designated smoking hour every day and residents are issued two cigarettes or small cigars by the staff.	post_7845987
post_8054531	Jun 16, 2012	187666	None	None	Did she fall? Is it soft or hard? Is it discolored? I ask because of the blood thinner, even a sturdy bump against something could cause a hematoma. That will gradually resolve on its own but takes time. If she fell and cracked a rib, that should be quite painful, even when she breathes or tries to raise her arm. If that's the case, I'd say have her checked out.	post_8021034
post_8053139	Jun 15, 2012	144586	None	None	The first thing you need is a medical proxy to discuss his treatment with his physician. Without such a proxy you are likely to have problems. Only the physician in charge would be in a position to provide you with an answer. Bear in mind they only like to have a point-of-contact with one family member. It is sometimes difficult to identify exactly who that physician is. This should be a priority. People with similar injuries may be admitted under the care of different "services", for example. The issue is not always the "rating" of the hospital. In most modern big-city hospitals in the United States, with the exception of some small ones, the treatment in an ICU is exactly the same. I would not be so quick to recommend transfer to another facility. The fact there is no head injury is very positive. Visit him on a daily basis and hold his hand while you do so. He will know you are doing that.	post_8028825

post_7929032	May 06, 2012	144586	None	None	The site has some facets of interest, however the main problem is simple companionship. Sitting next to an older person. Holding their hand. Listening to their stories. Not arranging a duty roster. There may be a niche for a computer database of "assigned tasks", but psychologically, this is not the way do do things. Certain tasks (such as mowing the lawn) should be paid for, especially if the elder person has means.    If this is not the case, it requires human effort to arrange for someone to help. Person-to-person contact.    It's pretty simple to take a pencil and paper or notebook and do everything this site does. Without leaving a permanant on-line record of material which may well end up in a court proceeding, such as a Guardianship. And the file on this net site will be available to a Court officer with a subpoena duces tecum. I am currently involved with a senior who has been before a judge to determine Guardianship and even a person's e-mails will be available to the court. So the issue of privacy "guaranteed" by this site is illusary. There is nothing offered on this site that cannot be accompsished more easily and more effectively by a cell phone and notebook.	post_7928527

post_7804861	Mar 26, 2012	144586	None	None	Novalog is a fast-acting insulin and is both expensive, and requires constant supervision by a physician or nurse who knows exactly what they are doing. Blood sugar levels of 500 are in the lethal range and are unaceptable, however there are many missing pieces to this story. What is her hba1c for example? And what is her fasting blood sugar in the morning and what is her diet? With proper diet there is no reason to obtain a fast-acting insulin. Novalog has advantages, but is not recommended for those who live alone. Lantus, a long-acting slow-release insulin may be more appropriate. I am not a happy camper knowing she is buming unused insulin from others. It is obvious her diabetes is completely out of control. Her diabetes needs to be evaluated by a qualified nurse, nurse-practicioner, and preferably an endochronologist and dietician who will come up with a plan of action that will preserve her life. As soon as possible. She might have a problem with so-called insulin resistance. There are lots of missing pieces to this story, and I would suggest you not be involved in obtaining Novalog for her without a physician's approval and prescription. There are many alternatives to controlling diabetes without using expensive fast-acting insulin.	post_7804377

This will give you physical proof that you did or didn't perform your obligations.    It will also be good to keep your brain stimulated with information and challenges to maintain neurological networking to prevent further degradation of these channels.    You will most importantly continue to confer with your neurologist for checkups in order to ascertain whether the dementia is progressing or regressing so that you avoid becoming a danger to your own health.Best in Health,JAG	post_7867311

post_8238689	Aug 14, 2012	585414	3192789	Whyy	Yes dementia is always a concern among people that are elderly when they encounter changes as you described. However dementia generally doesnt vary from day to night and doesnt involve involuntary movements. Have they ruled out the potential of nocturnal seizures by conducting an eeg and especially an eeg with a sleep test overnight? However of course only a doctor would understand the clinical specifics. But if the doctor examining him couldn't come to any conclusions it would be worthwhile to find a referral to a neurologist who is a gerontologist as well who could further follow up and provide a conclusive diagnosis and treatment.	post_8238664

An elevated ferritin level alone is not sufficient to accurately diagnose hemochromatosis that is why serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation are often performed together. A repeat test may be done to confirm this. Healthy people usually absorb about 10 percent of the iron contained in the food they eat,    while people with hemochromatosis absorb up to 30 percent of iron. Because the body has no natural way to rid itself of the excess iron, it is stored in body tissues, specifically the liver, heart, and pancreas. Take care and regards.	post_8214903

post_8063927	Jun 19, 2012	3049062	2202992	bikerchickmorton	Hello.    I took my six year old son to a pediatric dentist today and was told there is no enamel on his molars that just came in.    His bottom 2 front teeth came in fine.    He has not lost his baby teeth on the front top.    The dentist told me we would have to wait and see how those look, but since those teeth typically form at the same time as the 6 year molars, chances are they could come in without enamel as well.    I was told it was probably caused by an illness or high fever that he had sometime at the age of birth - 3 years.    The only thing I can think of is ear infections that he had during that time.    Seems like ear infections are common in kids, and therefore this problem would be more common and more known.    I had no idea teeth could come in without enamel.    I will be on pins and needles waiting to see how his next teeth come in.	post_8015028
post_8066970	Jun 20, 2012	2063512	3049062	jumpinbean600	My daughter    -who is now 14 - had so many ear infections in her first 2 years that she had burst eardrums x3 and 13 courses of antibiotics in 12/12. When her incisors came through they were half white, half yellow but when her first molars came they were ochre coloured and disintegrating as they emerged! So she had 8 completely wrecked teeth. I was read the riot act by more than 1 dentist about sweets and fizzy drinks -neither of which she has touched by choice EVER to this day. Her back adult molars came through ok - proving that it was the infection just at the time the first ones were forming that did it. Luckily as her teeth were crowded the dentist was able to monitor the timing and take out all the damaged molars (13 teeth in one go in hospital)    and allow the others to move forward and fill the gaps perfectly - So there is plenty of hope! All that we will do when she is adult is either whitening or veneers on her top incisors.	post_8015028

Did your dentist offer advice on how to care for her teeth throughout the years?    Obviously with enamel defects, the teeth are more susceptible to decay.    Our dentist went ahead and put a filling on my son's molars.    I'm wondering what the process will be if his front teeth come in the same way and if he fills them, how that will look.    Our dentist did not want to discuss options with me at this point.	post_8015028
post_8308414	Sep 07, 2012	3249813	None	None	I am 40 and have the same thing.    I have a sister and mother that have it also and my son.    I have two boys and their baby teeth were and are perfect.    They appear white but if you look they aren't glossy with that enamel look.    My oldest son's permanent teeth are now all in and he's teeth are yellowed and spotted just like mine were growing up.    Unfortunately there is not a permanent fix until you stop growing at about 18.    I was in my 30's when I had full cosmetic dentistry done on my teeth consisting of crowns and veneers.    My son and I also have extremely sensitive teeth.    From all my dental work we found that my nerves in my teeth also never receded like they typically should when you become an adult.    Eating cold foods hurts, whitening hurts, etc..    The only thing that I have found to help with trying to whiten my teeth and my son's is walnut powder.    I also have him brush with whitening toothpaste at least once daily and walnut powder as needed.    Consistent applications of fluoride can help with the sensitivity issues available at your dentist.    Walnut Powder I found at an herbal shop, but I'm sure you can find it online.    I have a small jar and it has lasted us 10 years plus.    It only takes a little.    It's a very fine powder and if your worried about it being abrasive, why? you already don't have enamel and I have yet to see any visible defects from using it.    To note that when you can get cosmetic dentistry done that you can end up with root canals due to the sensitive nerves in your teeth.    It can be very pricing, but it is all very worth it.    I love my smile now, but I do hate that my son is having to deal with this.    Like I said the walnut powder, whitening tooth pastes and fluoride helps.    I've been there and I'm there again!    I hope this helps someone! Best of luck!	post_8015028

However, there are many factors to consider that can affect this outlook such as the risks for medical conditions like    autoimmune diseases(type 1 diabetes, lupus, and hypothyroidism); obesity; osteoporosis; lymphoma and others. At this point, it is difficult to say which conditions will be present in the future.

post_8076267	Jun 23, 2012	526144	None	None	Hi,How are you? Epistasis describes how gene interactions can affect phenotypes or outward appearance of an organism to a given characteristic. Epitasis is not restricted to the interactions of only two genes but may occur in several scenarios such as whenever two or more loci interact to create new phenotypes; whenever an allele at one locus masks the effects of alleles at one or more other loci or whenever an allele at one locus modifies the effects of alleles at one or more other loci.    There are several examples of epistasis that may help you more in this link: http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/epistasis-gene-interaction-and-phenotype-effects-460Take care and best regards.	post_8051632

Everything that you put into your mouth while you are pregnant passes through your placenta and directly to the baby.    Why do you think some babies are born addicted to drugs?Nobody can tell you how your baby will turn out.    Only God knows that.Take care of yourself from now on.And if you really want to know how it will affect your baby,    from my experience, it is usually the moms that took excellent care to do the right things during their pregnancies who ended up with special kids.While it is true that genetics is all a crap shoot at conception, what you do during your pregnancy is not.    That is for you to control.Eat right, follow your doctor's orders, and take care of yourself for a few more weeks and pray that you will have a healthy child.Cead	post_8082310

If you had a bone marrow biopsy and genetic test, your geneticist should have answered your questions for you. If not, ask for a referral to genetic counseling.If you are of childbearing age and intend to have children, you should consult a geneticist for the possibility of transferring your balanced translocation (if that is what you have) to your offspring as an unbalanced rearrangement to your offspring.	post_7930340

Management of IBS depends mainly on dietary modification. Foods high in soluble fibre form the basis of all meals and snacks, and are the first thing to eat on an empty stomach. Safe foods include rice and pasta, oatmeal, fresh white breads, rice cereals, flour and corn tortillas, carrots, yams, potatoes and sweet potatoes. Insoluble fibre foods can also be eaten, but with care. Then, there are the trigger foods which are to be completely avoided. Consult a dietician for a diet chart.

post_7791160	Mar 21, 2012	1809109	None	None	Neither.Each egg has 23 chromosomes. Each sperm has 23 Chromosomes as well. However, these chromosomes from either egg or sperm are NOT identical and there is tons and TONS of variation in every single egg and sperm. So it really doesn't matter. Every egg, every half sibling on your mom's side has different genes and chromosomes that she personally supplied. The same goes with your half siblings on your father's side. There are some similarities with every sibling, but honestly even if all your siblings shared the both parents with you-NOTHING is the same unless you have an identical twin.Personally I have 5 half siblings. My two eldest sisters who share my father, I never talk to. However I do have some facial similarities. My three other older siblings I share a ridiculous amount of similarities with, ignoring the fact that they have a different father and spent every summer away from me and my mother to live with him. And honestly this starts to argue Nature over nurture. Do we have similar humor because of our shared mother, or because we grew up together? Either way my eldest half brother and I have identical hair color and very similar eyes. Our blood doesn't match up at all though- that's the fun part about knowing differences. Their father is O +/- or O+ and our mother is A+/- or A+. My brother is definitely A/O +/- and that's easy simple genetics that .. well honestly would be easier to explain if I drew it all out but having this kind of variation can be really interesting from a scholarly perspective.Now if you're asking about medical history honestly it gets complicated here, but I still take in all their medical info- alcoholism, cervical cancer, arrhythmia, depression- and call it family history. It's hard to know where this is coming from -our mother's side or their fathers, but if I assume I'm at risk and watch for it. It won't matter if I'm wrong, because I'll be prepared and hopefully catch anything early.	post_7790594

There are still other options as regards medications that you could discuss with his neurologist.Some of these medications can cause cognitive confusion as a potential side effect such as one you described which I have taken under the prescription name Artane (again the names of the medications vary in other countries). The standard carbodopa/levodopa combination for Parkinsons' (which can vary by name) is medically neccesary for Parkinsons but can create movement disorders over time. The other medications are similar to Piracetam which is not a prescribed medication in the U.S. but is in other countries. I take it under medical supervision and have not experienced any side effects of concern but each person responds diffrently to each medication.The best thing to do is to go to the medication website or the P.D.R. (physician's desk reference) and then discuss the information with his neurologist. They would also have a physician's only database where they could find the full information on all of the medications and make an informed decision within their clinical discretion. Also be sure to discuss any other medications that other doctors he is seeing or has seen are prescribing or have prescribed with his neurologist so that can rule out medication interactions.	post_8287466

post_8271715	Aug 26, 2012	585414	3218691	Strwberryblnd67	There are other options as regards treatment for dementia. For example I have known some people who have dementia who responded well to Namenda although each person responds differently to each medication. There are some concerns and contraindacations about the use of antipsychotics in people who are elderly and have dementia which would be noted on the medication websites. It would be important to find out why they considered the use of these medications to begin with. Also they need to diagnose the cause of the dementia as what would be used to treat it might vary dependent on that.Care at some nursing homes isn't always what it should be and it would be essential to have further diagnostic work and follow up from an outside treating physician who most likely should be a gerontologist. It would be worthwhile to find out if she could live in the community with a home attendant or if that would not be possible in a setting where she could recieve some supervision but be more able to interact with people in general as that can be helpful to anyone.	post_8271468

post_8254262	Aug 20, 2012	3050656	None	None	Hi! I, obviously, am no doctor (b/c I'm posting questions also-lol), but wanted to throw in my own experience. I have NO idea what's going on with me, no official diagnosis for anything, but I have noticed the same problem. I have memory loss/confusion, but I have noticed that it is almost impossible now for me to remember something if it is TOLD to me...conversations leave my memory almost immediately. Someone can tell me something & within the next few sentences from them, I have forgotten what they said in the beginning. And they get so frustrated when I ask a question & their only response is "I JUST said that". And I have a habit now of saying "I know you did, but it doesn't matter if you just said it, can you say it AGAIN". LOL    I wish I knew more about neurology & how the memory works, but I have ALWAYS had an easier time remembering things when I SEE them (that's why I never forget a face, & never forget directions of how to get somewhere once I've BEEN there.....well, until recently when the memory loss/confusion started). And while my memory is impaired these days in EVERY aspect, I do notice that it's easier to remember things if they're written. If you come across an answer to this question, I would love to know also. :)    I'm sure it has to do with which area of the brain is affected, but I don't know if there are treatments depending on which area of the brain is affected. That is very interesting & depending on what MY diagnosis is, I would be curious to know if there is a way to manage this type of symptom also. :)	post_8245436
post_8269871	Aug 25, 2012	1530171	None	ILADVOCATE, kimtexas1026	Hi!A friend    of mine was DX'd with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA)and also presented    signs of    Adult Acquired Central Auditory Processing Disorder (CAPD), which has similar symptom presentation as what you're posting.The DX criteria are almost non-existent in CAPD, however, impairmentor damage of the central auditory nervous system seems to be at the root of this. Have you had any    recent brain MRIs showing any abnormalities?Neuroaudiology is a new emerging field in medicine.You may want to go to the neuroaudiology website and under patient information look at the 2nd article for more info regarding this.I will look at Dr.Daniel Amen's book "Change Your Brain, Change Your Life" to see if there's any references to CAPD or similar conditions.More on this next time. Gotta run!Blessings.Niko	post_8245436

post_8257236	Aug 21, 2012	3050656	463897	MH Community Mgr	Oh thank you for the info. :)    I noticed after I posted my initial question (that I thought I was posting on a doctor's forum, where doctor's answer, since the previous posts showed that), that the last time someone had answered was like 2010, & 2007. So, I realized it might be an inactive board where docs weren't answering anymore. I was pretty sure I followed the link through the "ask a doc" forums to get to this one, so that's why I wasn't sure what I had done. :)    So, I haven't posted on the "ask a doc" forums again, afraid no one's actually there. LOLThank you for the info though.~Kim	post_8243266
post_8245207	Aug 16, 2012	None	3050656	KSalabama	Hi Kim.Well well! You're leading quite a challenging life, my dear!Things to do:1. Complete Nutritional panel including tissue analysis for minerals.2. Complete hormonal panel including thyroid function. If the latteris negative again, checkout type 2 hypothyroid. (thyroid tests are notoriously inaccurate or inadequate!)3. Neurotransmitter deficiency! You really need to be tested for this.For now, take extra virgin coconut oil (EVCO), 2T daily to start in place of cooking oils, which are pro-inflammatory.EVCO is one of tha few things that can cross the blood-brain-barrier to supply your brain with much needed nourishment and energy! You most likely have an impaired glucose uptake.B12. take only methylcobalamin sublingual drops. (NOT cyanocobalamin!)D3. take also sublingual drops.Omega-3 from small cold water fish. Highest quality.Transdermal magnesium oil daily!Glutathione. Take Undenatured whey protein 10-20grams x3 daily in your shakes smoothies or yogurt or juice. NO blender-NO heat. Just mix well manually. Your glutathione levels when high, regulate the JNK gene.The JNK gene when activated, it leads to SERIOUS disease over time.Dementia, Bi-polar, Alzheimer's, etc.( JNK type 3 is specific for the brain.)I suspect your glutathione levels are low.Just curious. Do you have a health coach or somebody helping you with your health issues management?This must be tough for you under the circumstances.Please post again for details, questions or to just comment.You may also pm me if you prefer.Wish you well.Niko	post_8229151
post_8251424	Aug 19, 2012	3050656	1530171	Nikodicreta	Hi Niko!Thank you for your post. Actually, I am going to research the impaired glucose uptake... b/c when my memory issues first started, with the confusion/etc, I thought it was low blood sugar..had all the symptoms of low blood sugar. But my blood sugar was within normal limits (lower than it SHOULD be, I thought, but still "normal").    You mentioned both vitamins B12 & D3..... my doc put me on 50,000 IUs a week of vitamin D about 6wks ago, & the neuro I saw (who gave me 10 different possibilities for my memory loss), mentioned low B12 as a possible cause. So, I immediately started taking a B-complex vitamin...and have been on that for over a month now. But that's one of the tests I'm asking my doc to do, is a    B12 test... b/c either my B12 was never a problem (since nothing has changed since I've been taking it), or I have a problem absorbing the B12 I AM taking in oral form... since nothing has changed since I started taking it. ;)I haven't heard of the JNK gene, or glutathione levels, so I want to research that too. Is that something docs would normally check out? And no I don't have a health coach necessarily, I have my regular primary doc. I also plan on having my thyroid checkd again, it's been a year since it was checked last & I'm not sure how quickly things could change with the thyroid, but since my mom is hypothyroid, and I have 75% of the symptoms of THAT, I want to keep on top of it if it DOES go low.Thank you for your info, & insight... I just hope my doc has an idea of which direction to go, or else I'm afraid her next referral is going to be to a psychiatrist. LOL    Although, I have to admit I have thought about possible psychiatric causes also. But the only thing that comforts me there, is thinking that the very fact I even considered a psychiatric cause means it's probably NOT. ;) OH, & I've never heard anything about EVCO either... I need to research that too. :)I don't know much about Medhelp yet, so I don't know how to PM people. :) Any pointers you can give in that area? LOLThanks again, for the info, & for the help.~Kim	post_8229151
post_8251951	Aug 19, 2012	1530171	3050656	KSalabama	Hi Kim.Just go over my name and this will open my profile box.At the right side it gives you the option to "leave a note""send a message" or "add as a friend".    You can try all those 3while you're at it, if you wish. I will get notified by email shortly afterwords.When you have a new message, it will also show at the top right side of this page under "inbox", and any recent member activity within this part of the forum will be showing below that.The glutathione levels, normally do not get checked. There are over 80.000-not a typo- studies on glutathione!The jnk gene is something that many MDs don't even know what it is!Conventional medicine unfortunately leaves out many fundamental wellnessaspects, that could dramatically improve the health condition of mostsufferers. I could write an entire book on this.lol!I'm sure I must have some reference on my medical record of possible psyche patient, as my Neuro many years ago suggested that all the symptoms were in my head-after his inability to keep my medical records and his notes in order and come up with anything useful to find some answers.When I confronted him that he had my file mixed up, following some bizarre suggestions that had nothing to do with my case, he almost flipped!I simply told him that would be the last time we would have any discussion,as he couldn't even diagnose boiled eggs lol! and walked out!It all turned out great,at the end and I'm now enjoying excellent health.More on this another time perhaps.For details on EVCO visit the coconut research center website.gtg as I'm the cook tonight!PM me anytime!Cheers!Niko	post_8229151
post_8254236	Aug 20, 2012	3050656	1530171	Nikodicreta	Wow, thanks for the info on how to navigate MedHelp & pm. :)    I would definitely like to keep in touch, as you seem to have some very good info! I am just getting into holistic medicine, & even going to take classes to become an ayurvedic practitioner (although I am JUST learning about the field). But I DO think traditional western medicine falls short SO much... and so many people I have talked to in my life have experienced this too...doctors just not having answers, & acting like if it doesn't jump up & slap them in the face, then it doesn't exist. It's sad really.And I laughed out loud when I read your comment on what you said to your neurologist... I wish I had thought of that b/c that sounds like the neuro I saw a month or two ago, & I REALLY wanted to tell her how very little I thought she knew or understood about ANYTHING. Her last advice as I was leaving the room (after she "guessed" at 10 possible causes for my memory loss & confusion), she said "And don't worry, it will get better". Really??? That's her medical treatment plan "it'll get better"??? ;c) Wow, that was a great use of 12 years of her life through medical school, huh? LOLThanks so much for the info. I'm sure I will have tons more questions for you, since I am JUST starting my journey in holistic medicine. :)~kim	post_8229151
post_8761636	Jan 21, 2013	657231	4748534	Michellejo	You may have to consult a geriatric psychiatric specialist. I know with my Mother in Law, we ended up having to admit her to get a set of medications to work. She had reversed day and night and kept forgetting that she went to the bathroom and wanted to go constantly.In older people, medications can work differently so I would contact the doctor and see if you can get a specialist to advise the doctor to prescribe a new set to try at home or to admit her for a short period to get a set of meds so she can sleep and be calmer.I would not try OTC items without talking to a pharmacist about her current medications. Even herbs and all can have unintended effects so best to check it out.	post_8757345

post_8761665	Jan 21, 2013	1530171	4751378	MommaTee727	My computer is acting up! lol! Plus something else came up.Let's start over.It's a delicate situation.When protein (mainly animal protein from diet) is broken down in the body by intestinal bacteria, in the process, there's ammonia produced, that his liver does not process, thus getting into the blood circulation and causing all sorts of complications.One of them is    ammonia toxicity in the brain.Should this be the case, then namenda, a glutamate blocker, would be    counterindicated, as ammonia in the brain inhibits neurotransmitter synthesis, including glutamate and GABA-all necessary for proper brain/neuronal function.Some of the common side effects include : confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, insomnia, agitation, and/or hallucinations.This analysis should be considered carefully and discussed with the prescribing physician, should it indeed be accurate.The possibility of the wrong medication with unwanted effectsis there, according to the limited information I have from your post.Also a very knowledgeable nutritionist/dietician familiar with liver issues andammonia toxicity, should be consulted.    Most doctors know    little about nutrition.I would question his Alzheimer's status, by looking into the    brain toxicitythat may have effects    mistakenly considered as Alzheimer's signs or symptoms.This being only my opinion, should not be used as a substitute for medical advice.Hope it helps and please let me know if you need more details.Niko	post_8758529

post_8620987	Dec 14, 2012	657231	4458811	strangecindy	I am sorry to hear about your sister.I would get the spots are *white matter* and can be caused by anything from small strokes to high blood pressure.There are many sites for dementia and Alzheimer - that can simple be looked for using your favorite search engine. It can be subtle to some especially if the person has a long progression of the disease? Also they list several stages and from the people I have known, the stages are fluid - people do not progress through them in order all the time. I know my MIL did not and now my FIL is not following the order either.I do believe the diagnosis is one of exclusion - so you rule out everything else and it leaves just that. It sounds like at this time your sister is in the process and the diagnosis is not final.From a dementia site - how to diagnose:"A thorough medical historyMental status testingA physical and neurological examTests (such as blood tests and brain imaging) to rule out other causes of dementia-like symptoms "I hope your sister gets other news.	post_8596057

post_8628174	Dec 16, 2012	1530171	4458811	strangecindy	Hey strangecindy.Unfortunately, a negative belief/emotion and the stress associated with this, such as in your sister's case, may indeed be a co-factor in her cognitive decline and memory issues.Probable Alzheimer's is, to my opinion, a disservice to the patients, as a significant aspect of a diagnosis, is diagnosis of exclusion of other conditions presenting similar symptomology.It is , again to my opinion, a way out    for the diagnosing physician,in the event that it turns out to be something else.You may be on to something here, with your suspicion.The static imaging of spots on the brain from an MRI, is hardly indicative of anything relative to Alzheimer's at all!The final diagnostic criteria for the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) has been approved by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) as of Dec. 5th, but won't be published till sometime in May of 2013.You may message me directly for a link for a website    that comprises a complete set of DSM-IV criteria for all currently used mental disorders.It is the only one that has a complete set of dx criteria.It is against MedHelp forum rules to post links for other websites and forums, blogs, etc.Cheers!Niko	post_8596057

There isn't one here.I agree the white spots are not relative - I help out on the brain tumor board so I get questions relative to the white matter spots frequently. They can come from so many sources.	post_8596057

What symptoms does the patient have? Is there a history ofdementia, stroke or heart disease? Rating scales like a mini mentalstatus exam or MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) are useful.

post_8678818	Jan 01, 2013	1722857	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	Thanks for the comment, Heart. I've been thinking back to all the sort of "lapses" I've had. I noticed a few at the beginning of this new school year (I'm a teacher).In the first few days of school I blanked on a co-worker's name. I was standing at the copier in the teachers room and he came in and said hi and I totally spaced out on his first name (I did remember his last name). Of course the second I walked out of the teachers room it came to me.I also did some odd things in October. One morning I poured myself a glass of almond milk before school and instead of putting it back in the fridge where it belongs I put it in the glass cupboard. I didn't realize this until I came home that afternoon, went to pour myself another glass and saw that it wasn't in the fridge. I immediately realized what I'd done and found it in the cupboard.Another morning my fiancÃ  and I were making eggs for breakfast. He was cracking the eggs into a bowl as I was making my morning coffee. As I was tearing open the sugar packets for my coffee I started a conversation with him and instead of pouring the sugar into my coffee I poured it into the bowl of eggs. My fiancÃ  asked what the heck I was doing and only then did I notice that I was pouring the sugar into the eggs and not my coffee cup that was right next to the bowl.Maybe I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but when I look at all the "silly" things I've done in the past four months it still sort of scares me. I have a doctors appointment on Thursday for an unrelated issue (I had my first migraine headache a few weeks ago).I don't know if the migraine was brought on by the stress of me worrying about the memory issues or if they're related in another way. I think I'll feel better once I talk to my doctor about what's been going on.M	post_8630027

She said sometimes your mind is elsewhere when you're trying to do something and it needs a moment to refocus. That's definitely me. I feel like my mind is always buzzing with something (I've always been a worrier)I'm actually starting to take fish oil supplements to see if t helps with my anxiety.

post_8685828	Jan 02, 2013	None	657231	rumpled	Hi rumpled.Valerian root tea is an interesting natural alternative to xanax.It has a similar activity to benzodiazepines (xanax belongs to this class of drugs) and also it may offer neuroprotection (in preventing lipid oxidation in the brain).It helps reduce stress and anxiety and there are no associated risks when taking 1-2 cups daily (last one should be about 1 hour before bedtime.)Melatonin is O.K too, but it has to be started at the smallest dose and increase only if needed. I find that it helps if the person is adequately exposed to natural light during the day, as this helps regulate the production and timing of the body's natural melatonin so the supplementation would be minimum. Use only synthetic as there have beenmany contamination issues from animal source melatonin.Cutting down on the length of naps, may help fall asleep easier and also sleep better at night.Hypnotherapy and Meditation have been my preferred methods of addressing sleep issues and insomnia, however, not recommendedin this case because of his dementia.The only exception for him, would be listening to binaural sounds to lower his brain activity to a theta and then delta state. The drawback is that someone has to monitor him for 5-10 minutes till he falls asleep.If you're thinking to get him off xanax, make sure the doctor can help himwean off it, as it could be very tricky. Benzos have a bad reputation for    withdrawal symptoms, dependant upon dosage and length of time taken.Hope this helps.Cheers!Niko	post_8683622
post_8686770	Jan 03, 2013	657231	1530171	Nikodicreta	I will see if we can add some tea - his appetite at this point is not the best. He is a big napper. He has a lung issue and his energy is not good for physical reasons as well as his body is not well at this point. He is not consistent, despite trying to keep him to a schedule as that really helps! in how he wants to do things even eating, exercising etc. He always is a stubborn man.Sounds are not much of an option - he is 100% deaf in one ear with poor hearing in the other and has never liked to listen to music much - something the deprived his poor wife of much enjoyment.Not looking to wean - he really needs the anti-anxiety med sadly.

post_8704656	Jan 07, 2013	212161	657231	rumpled	hi, and so sorry your going threw this, but what a Blessing to him to have you help him out. just never forget to eat and get rest yourself.first let me say , the pill he takes will only work so long, as my mother was also on that and its not a good sleep pill, and yes after a few months your body gets use to it and than it will want more. i would get him on something thats made for sleep and will keep him there .xanax is for anxiety and its just not a good pill the side affects are bad after awhile.next wow i would not leave him at home alone. my mom wanted that to , so we just keep her ourself, there is so many things that can happen in a short time and if hes up at night by hisself it could be trouble, he could wonder off, or cause a fire anything could take place. sad to say but there comes a time where we dont get what we want. he needs someone with him at all times if hes doing that at night.you can look into his health benefits if hes on medcare they will pay sometimes for help, or hire someone to stay with him at night. or the family can take turns staying with him. its really hard on us a care takers but better to be safe than sad.wish ya all the luck, talk to dr see if there is anything he can give him besides what hes on. Blessings to him and your family	post_8683622
post_8707795	Jan 08, 2013	657231	212161	heartfluttersflyawayplz	If it was my father, I would not leave him home but my husband is trying to respect his wishes of not going into a home. There is pressure on him by close friends (who emigrated with his father) to leave him home but his dad cannot afford 24 hour care so basically it is a nasty situation - my hubs feels compelled to leave him home until medicaid kicks in and then he will be in the worst home ever.    Dad cannot stay with us - I am disabled myself and he is a very difficult person even before this. I do all I can though to help him. He has caregivers through the day.He keeps calling the friends in the middle of the night though so maybe they will realize he needs more help? But they don't really understand the finances of it all. They think the government pays for home care which just does not happen.Medicare and medicaid will not pay at all for home care.	post_8683622

post_8639943	Dec 19, 2012	1530171	4527650	mingus78	Hi mingus78 and welcome to the forum.As Sarah mentioned the information you have provided, is far too little.The brain and the CNS are of astronomical complexity..In brain degenerative diseases grey matter is decreased in size or/and damaged, however, the extremely diverse etiology , complexity and the large number of these diseases, does not allow for speculation, given thelack of detailed MRI findings, symptoms and patient history.Studies show is that EPA has an extraordinary effect on the brain's ability to re-generate nerve cells and therefore improve brain function in all areas.This could be considered for immediate implementation along with supplementation of MCTs by consuming virgin organic cocnut oil.It has    been established that ketones from MCTs are the principal alternative fuel for the brain, when the brain's primary energy source (glucose) is unavailable or in short supply, as they can cross the blood-brain barrier.So while waiting for further investigation and possible treatment,consider looking into the above suggestion, which will not interfere with anything at all and considered safe at the recommended dosage of1000 mg EPA from quality sources and 3-4 Tablespoons of Virgin Organic Coconut Oil daily.May need to increase the latter dosage substantially, should there indeed be an impairment in glucose supply and delivery to the brain.Please do your own research or consult a holistic health care professionalexperienced in this field.You may post here again with more details or you can PM me any time.Take care.Niko	post_8637932

post_8628753	Dec 16, 2012	1530171	4458811	strangecindy	Hi again strangecindy.I just accidentally erased my reply to you so I'll repeat it but a bit condensed.heartfluttersflyawayplz offered you a good suggestion.Find fun and interesting indoor activities as a couple, as well for yourself.Look into full spectrum lighting for SAD (seasonal affective disorder)which I'm very familiar with, as I live in Northern Canada.Also make sure you know your Vitamin D levels.Watch those opioid meds. They may contribute to your depression,specially in the winter when the barometric pressure is lower, affecting you production of    natural cortisol - the feel good hormone- thus contributing further to your depression.Checkout natural alternatives* instead of opioid meds, but as you probably know, the withdrawal    symptoms can be nasty!You would need a co-operative and knowledgeable health Professional to help you wean off those meds.Yes, I know, what is going through your mind!. It's a difficult, if not impossible thing to consider at this moment and most people in your position would reject this suggestion instantly!However, it's a doable recommendation and with the above aforementioned suggestions, it may make a dramatic difference in your life and help rekindle your relationship with your husband.* Search for Dr. E Sarno, author of many books on pain, specially on back pain, and originator of the Tension Myositis Syndrome.TMS achieved a 57% success rate among patients with chronic back pain,according to a 2005 study at the Seligman Medical Institute, which is quite remarkable, considering that it is a totally holistic non-invasive and drug freeapproach.There are many other natural remedies and treatments that can help with DDD.For more responses you may try other communities, as this one is for Alzheimer's disease.Just check them out, by going to forums on the blue line on top of this page.If you need more info or details you may also send me a direct message,by going to my profile box that opens up when you go over my name.Cheers!Niko	post_8596143

post_8627846	Dec 16, 2012	1530171	4458811	strangecindy	Hey stangecindy.Sleep apnea dx is unfortunately open to debate, due to variability of    the symptoms, making the link to alzheimer's disease a bit of a challenge.We know that sleep apnea is characterized by low oxygen supply, which could be a co-factor, however the link has not been established scientifically, as there are no large enough studies regarding this particular area of research.The few smaller studies, show that there's a prevalence of sleep apnea inmainly female elderly subjects, diagnosed with dementia and with probableAlzheimer's disease.PMID: 4008448So not a rumour to my opinion, but more like anecdotal evidence from small studies.heartfluttersflyawayplz: Many patients don't even know that they suffer from sleep apnea, as the symptoms may not be so evident or significant.A 10 second pause in the breathing or very low breathing per every 5 minutes on average(which is the minimum established standard for sleep apnea) is perhaps a little difficult to notice. That's why an overnight sleep study is necessary( the most important diagnostic criteria is a positive polysomnogram/sleep study).Sleep apnea runs in my family.Hope this helps.Cheers!Niko	post_8596101
post_8595727	Dec 07, 2012	657231	4456445	4skippy	I found this:"The purpose of a pacemaker is simple: it prevents your heart beat from going too slow.    The device is attached to the heart via wires called leads and spends its life looking for native impulses arising from the cardiac muscle.    If your natural pulse rate drops below 60 (or whatever our programmed number is) the pacemaker will begin stimulating the heart with an imperceptible electrical shock once every second.    The current passes through the tip of the lead into the adjacent heart muscle, and then spreads to the entire ventricle by flowing from cell to cell at lightning speed.    The stimulus triggers a brief restructuring of proteins and results in contraction of the muscle fibers.    Within a fraction of a second the entire ventricle wrings out somewhere around a hundred milliliters of blood into the aorta.To summarize this series of events:Step 1. Pacer sends electricity to lead tip.Step 2. Electrical impulse conducts to tissue at the point of contact and spreads throughout the heart.Step 3. The electrical impulse causes the heart to contract.Now letâ  s talk about what happens to the heart at the moment of imminent demise.    One thing that a healthy body does really well is eliminate waste products (and, no, I am not complimenting you on your talents in the bathroom): the lungs eliminate carbon dioxide and the kidneys and liver break down and eliminate unwanted metabolic byproducts.    As these important organs deteriorate your blood becomes saturated with metabolic detritus and becomes an inhospitable milieu for normal cellular function.    Most notably, the pH of the blood drops and the normally neutral serum slowly turns into a weak acid.    Once the pH falls more than a fraction of a point the heart muscle becomes incapable of propagating an electrical stimulus or mounting an effective ventricular contraction."A regular pacemaker thus will not keep her alive just keep her comfortable. If she had one with a defibrillator than that would be a different matter as that shocks the heart into working. That feature would have to be considered to be turned off at some point if the patient and family desires.Does she have written wishes or did she express wishes? Is she healthy enough for the surgery? Patients with dementia are not always healthy in the end. Either way, the pacemaker is not going to extend her life.	post_8594360
post_8596797	Dec 07, 2012	4456445	657231	rumpled	Thank you for the information.    Yes she did sign a DNR years ago - but my 2 sisters feel it is not the same and that they want to replace the battery. I guess will see what mother nature has in store as I don't think a heart can take constant pulsing if it is 90 yrs old, had bypass 15 years ago, and now has dementia/alzheimers. Eventually the brain is going to stop working and the pacemaker will not be able to keep her alive. Just wondering how much longer you do stay alive with the pacemaker?? It has to extend your life. As I see it, what are we extending??	post_8594360
post_8599145	Dec 08, 2012	657231	4456445	4skippy	Have you spoken to her doctor about your concerns? That should be considered as he/she would be able to tell you about the pacemake vs DNR vs dementia and what should be the overriding consideration. Are your sisters close by and involved in her care? Are you? Those involved more should know more?Depending on how her POA is written - do all three have to agree, or is it just one of you making decisions?It can be very complex. Went through this recently with my aunt - the decisions made though I must say were a squabble among sons and my aunt died a very painful death due to one (who was not involved in her care at all) wanting to withhold morphine, not turn off the pacemaker/defibrillator when they could tell it was only extending, and she was brain dead - it was rather awful. So I do hope that you can work it out peacefully for your mom's sake.	post_8594360

post_8612277	Dec 11, 2012	1530171	4456445	4skippy	4skippy, why was this question even raised?When euthanasia is obviously NOT an option and    DNR is NOT applicable here at all!!! (the sisters are right), why would anyone question the replacement of a pacemaker, a rather simple procedure involving a minimally invasive surgery?It is implanted under the skin, it takes less than an hour and only requires a local anaesthetic. All she needs is clearance from the cardiologist.Her Dementia, unfortunately, does not allow her to express verbally her possible symptoms WITHOUT a new pacemaker:Palpitations, pounding in her chest, dizziness or feeling light-headed, fainting, shortness of breath, chest discomfort, weakness or fatigue.This is not a choice of extending her life or letting her go, it is about giving her the opportunity to live with less pain and suffering.We have no idea how people in her situation really feel, but we can only try to imagine.My mom was in a similar predicament, paraplegic,with TBI (following an accident involving an intoxicated driver, dementia, and in need    to have herpacemaker replaced.It was really an easy decision, as I had witnessed her almost daily scary and very painful"episodes", well before her paroxysmal tachycardia dx, that led to the implantation of her first pacemaker.I would not have considered an extra day of her being without a new one.She passed on last May at he age of 78 a couple years after the new pacemaker was installed, and I'm at peace with her passing and knowing that her life was just a little more comfortable.I'm hoping that my reply helps bring some clarity in this matter.Blessings to all!Niko	post_8594360

post_8483493	Nov 03, 2012	1530171	4259889	PaulMUK	Hi Paul and welcome to the forum.I would be worried too, if my girlfriend/wife was forgetful and mixing up words, at her age.There's probably a significant aspect of stress, well hidden within her.If I were a betting man, I would bet that she learnt from young that showingstress, worry and fear , is considered a sign of weakness.In terms of her vibrational energies, there are three underlying determinants of her behaviour, linked to her symptoms.1. Fear and    insecurity, arising from starting a new business.It takes a great deal of energy to rise above the fear. In many cases thenegative events of our world fuel it further.Frequency 100.2. Desire, to the surprise of most, is a negative feeling with a frequencyof 125 (baseline is Courage at 200). Desire leads us to expend a tremendous amount of energy in the pursuit of various objectives, usually material ones. Her desire to succeed in her new business is creating anenergetic deficit, consequently manifesting in a cognitive deficit.3. Pride at 175 is a defensive emotion, rendering one vulnerable to falling down to even lower vibrational levels, as it is fuelled by the ego.Denial is common characteristic of Pride and the downside is the restriction of energy flow, not allowing lower emotions to get expressed and flow through. Pride is influenced greatly by external conditions, so any positive factors/events will help bring the person closer to the baseline.Physical and molecular level investigation does have its merits, however,the basis of her issues is within the mental/emotional, to my opinion.By resolving the basis, the symptoms will eventually vanish, barring of course any serious physical damage.By treating the symptoms at the physical/molecular level will justdo that, until the mental/emotional is dealt with effectively.It would very premature and unwarranted to suspect Alzheimer's Disease,at this point.Perhaps you would benefit more if you would post at the Memory LossCommunity. If you do, you may also want to take a look at some of my recent comments there, as this could help shed some more light.Please feel free to post again if you need more details, or just to comment.Wishing you and your girlfriend well.Niko	post_8478400

post_8335879	Sep 17, 2012	1711789	3193432	cuzpach	Hi there!Though commonly linked with Alzheimerâ  s and dementia, brain atrophy/ shrinkage is common with age and does not necessarily mean that it would lead to the development of Alzheimerâ  s. The pathophysiology of Alzheimerâ  s is not clearly understood though several risk factors and genetic correlations have been implicated. As long as she does not have any neurological concerns, I would not suspect this to be anything to be worried about yet. The idea is to avoid risk factors such as alcohol, factors that could lead to strokes etc and keep the brain active preferably in high function activities such as reading, puzzle solving etc.Hope this is helpful.Take care!	post_8326467

(Had to be reminded where she was driving to)    However, how can you tell if this is normal age related forgetfulness or something more serious?    I have not seen anything too obvious myself    but will reccomned she continue to read and will get her some puzzle things.Her mother my grandmother is 82 and is in stage 6 alzhimiers started around 13-14 years ago, so we do have a family history.Thanks for your time.	post_8326467
post_8343881	Sep 19, 2012	1530171	3193432	cuzpach	Hey cuzpach.Brain shrinkage or atrophy starts in the 20s at an average rate of 1.90% per decade.Once people get in to their    60's the rate can increase to up to 1% annually!While some memory loss is age related and considered "normal" ,there are too many variable factors that have to do with acceleratedmemory loss and cognitive decline.Some lifestyle related factors can be addressed, so that their contribution to further damage is lessened or arrested and alongwith several mental activities and    exercises-as Dr Kaul mentioned-all this should help with her memory issues.At a cost of    approx. $1500.00 for genetic testing ( cost here in Canada)you can find out about genetic factors, directly linked to Alzheimer's.The only one gene that is known(so far) to lead to the development of alzheimer's (late stage onset) is apolipoprotein E APOE) if you wish to research thisThere are 4 types of this gene and each of us has two copies.We can know find out -according to which pair of APOE type-about the genetic risk factor of getting alzheimer's and perhaps when.Let me know if you need more details.Take care.Niko	post_8326467

I keep waiting for some turning point where the doctors will take notice and insist on some kind of assisted care. Unfortunately that usually means something dangerous has happened and I don't like that.I'm sorry your mom was hanging over that cliff but glad someone took notice and got her the care she needs and that you will surely appreciate.

There are so many possibilities that could cause a rainbow effect: cataracts, infections, corneal edema (that makes sense since light would pass through the extra fluid and cause a prism effect).

There are many possibilities, as ireneo stated, but in terms of differential diagnosis, "Prisms" around lights that come and go are hallmarks of developing diabetes. They generally correlate with blood sugars over 400. As the sugars go down with the day and exercise, the prisms disappear.	post_8503725
post_8434597	Oct 19, 2012	187666	None	None	What a difficult time for them all. And an 11 year old child is going to be upset under any circumstances if she's missing out on a fun trip to Disneyland.What I'm not clear about is this: the ill child (?18 years old?) is a cousin? And the 11 year old girl's mom is going on the trip? Is it really necessary for the mom to go or could they enlist the help of another close family member or friend? I think part of the jealousy is seeing her mom go on a trip with someone else.It would also be a huge help if dear old Dad would work with mom and be in agreement about this situation. He is not helping at all and the little girl probably knows this. In some ways his behavior is no better than the child's. Surely he understands how much this trip means to the dying child.I don't have any clear answers. I do know after raising 3 kids of my own and now dealing with 4 grandkids, there are times we have to be the adults and simply say no. We can be respectful, try to explain the reasoning behind our choices but we still get the final word and sometimes it is "no." Our kids will fuss and fume because they're not getting their way. Eventually they move on and will fuss over something else.

My irrational behavior towards her and interference with her being provided with pleasure haunts me to this day. I was a jealous monster.    I recently visited her grave. Frankly I should have been ignored. The dying childs pleasures should come first and the tantrums ignored. In years to come the child who has been "hurt" will fully understand and forgive you. If you allow her to ruin this cavation you will place upon her a burden she will remember for the rest of her life.	post_8431877
post_8435059	Oct 19, 2012	4122676	187666	ireneo	Hello ireneo, I commend    U when U stated:I do    hope one day this 11 year old girl will look back and understand the difference between a dying wish and a simple fun vacation. This is the way it is:THIS WIL NOT BE A FUN-FILLED vacation. It will be visiting the park for maybe 2-3 hrs. w/ a wheelchair/w/10 L. of    O2 for the ill child, slowly making her way    as far as her energy level and oxygen surfice. Most of the time will be in her room, resting, as she has not enough Energy to even "laugh" or talk for a few minutes. THIS WILL BE A Last Hoo-Rah. and I'm here, I see Disneyworld...I'm just so glad I have placed my feet here while I am alive and can see it.    This will be no fun for the mom, grandmother and yes, "mother" of the jealous 11 yr. old, but the other caregiver's NEED her help. It takes them all to do this and more.I feel as you said, the child will understand one day that this was NO fun trip, and if she went she would have NO fun. taking time to think about her going with her parent's later on by herself with her parent's is the FUN way to see it....I the devoted friend can only hope she will see this of her first cousin and be happy the child had the chance to live her dream. ty..	post_8431877
post_8435106	Oct 19, 2012	4122676	144586	caregiver222	thankyou so much for your sharing your feelings w/us. I can understand what you say.    Do U remember why you were so upsetting to the child? Did U do it for attention, or just the fact she received attention more than you even though it it "different" attention in almost everyway. People, caregivers, the nurses, they are all "doing" bringin""working"to just give this child a way to just be in existance...she has a IV in her chest, she is wrapped up with a tight binder holding her food contents because her g-tube can't be placed correctly due to her body breakdown. Her body will not heal anymore from cut's, etc. Her lung/heart are scarred and not functioning but just minimal. She is in constant struggle against this horrible condition...she deserves her famililes help and love,and yet I hear she NEVER complains...she just want's to live out her dream of the "magic" of Disney. It is a sad situation. We can not help or save them all, but we can    do what we can to make them comfortable while they are on this earth. why GOD chooses to uproot a child's life and from birth I might add, is something I will never understand.Please share more of your thought's when young if you can remember. It does help the adult's that read this to understand how a child could "think" of this in their head.    ty.U R blessed.	post_8431877
post_8437566	Oct 20, 2012	144586	None	None	I was jealous because she was receiving    very special attention, being fawned over and I was being ignored. I cannot understand to this day why I threw such tantrums and did my best to make her life miserable. Just being a kid, I guess.    I didn't understand she was dying. I know this. That even though this was over a half-century ago I still regret my actions to this day and wish that someone had put me in my place.	post_8431877

These"special need's" children,and the same with "terminal" written before a parent on paper or just in there "head" is enough to send some parent's on a roller-coaster ride spinning out of control, and most feel (in my opinion from hearing them talk) they will do anything they can to ensure a "happy as can be" enviroment for them on eath.I'm trying now to learn "how:" the innocent children that live with "special" chldren might feel, and as you say, feel later on in life.I think your feeling were normal. You are just one person, you R you! Whatever you did or did not do during that time is not YOU now. U did not know how to act, how could you, you had no one to teach you, this is not something we learn from life as a child...it is not expected as a everday lfe lesson.    I hope my question did not stir up much feelings that will hang around and bother you. Please don't let that happen, I understand, I might well have done the same if I where where you, or this 11 yr. old is right now...We are all a miracle in this world, U should let go ot the regret. U did not know how to react. I'm sure U weren't the only one then, and certainly not in the world today not knowing what it mean's to be "different" "special" "terminal"...hard words, but true.

I'm sorry, but why is this woman completely devoted to her niece and completely neglecting her own child? That is why the 11 year old is lashing out - it's because she knows her mother loves her cousin more than she loves HER! It's clearly obvious!It's not really about the trip, but the fact that this girl knows that she us unloved and ignored by her mother. Her mother would rather be with the family of the ill cousin than be with her daughter. And that family should be ashamed, they knowingly are taking a mom away from her own family so she can care for theirs. They know that the 11 year old is upset but they don't care about her - I bet they don't even feel guilty!Relay THAT to them. It seems the only children that are valued and held as precious to them are sick ones.	post_8431877
post_8411664	Oct 11, 2012	144586	None	None	You have my sympathies. I have some specific advice for which I cannot take credit for. It was suggested to me by a psychiatrist who referred me to assist several of his elderly patients. His advice was essentially that elderly people with anger, dementia and paranoia react very differently to personal visits than they do to telephone calls. And even differently to written messages (letters) or e-mails. It may not be possible to visit in person, but information and conversation that is face-to-face is significantly more therapeutic and significant than a call by telephone.His feelings were that "telephone therapy" is far less effective than person-to-person therapy. I realize that the telephone may be the only practicable means of communication in many instances and it is better than nothing. Nevertheless there is both a qualitative and quantitative difference between telephone contact and in-person contact.His advice was always to have a person-to-person talk with a patient who exhibits inappropriate behavior or reactions to your attempts to be friendly or make contact on a telephone. He also suggested that when such patients say "never see me again" they are being manipulative and want to observe your reactions. In other words, ignore them. Another comment involves the perception of time. You have no idea how a person who experiences dementia experiences time. All people do not experience the passage of time in the same way.    Thus, you may feel you have to stay away for a week after an argument, when in point-of-fact, an hour later the person has changed their mind, regrets what they have said (or may not remeber it), and anticipates your call.	post_8409923
post_8413924	Oct 12, 2012	187666	None	None	Thank you for the feedback. Yes, she does have trouble with time. Can't tell what day of the week it is, what days I come over, and at times can't tell day from night and she will sit there waiting for daylight to show. Well, if it's 7 at night, that could be awhile.According to 3 psychologists (2 of them are friends, one is the counselor I met with for coping strategies) my mom has borderline personality disorder. So she can be quite manipulative, has even bragged about    the things she does to confuse or upset people. Whew. But she is also very determined to always have her way. She's not afraid to hang up on us (phone) or refuse to answer the door when we come over. And from our last conversation, it sounds like she's ramping up the security on her home so the key I have will no longer work.I'm thinking of sending her a note, one of those "thinking of you" type cards. It's a chicken's way out. But after a lifetime of hurt from her, I'm not quite ready to put my feelings on the line again, at least not at this moment. I'm feeling better that we have her doctor involved now. But I can send her a note, tell her I'm worried about her, hope she's getting all the things done that she wanted to get done, things like that. No comments on the blow up. I want to keep the door open if she wants us to come back. But I'm just not up for being slammed again.It's been a difficult 60 years for me but I want her to have the help she needs. I'm just not sure I can provide it all at this stage.Again, thank you and I'll let you know how things go.	post_8409923
post_8415287	Oct 12, 2012	144586	None	None	I would also consider applying to the court for a limited Guardianship. There are many types of Guardianships and the judge tries to decide which type would enable the patient to exercise the most freedom consistent with their condition. The trick is to apply for a Guardianship before the patient becomes too confused and demented. Paranoia and accusations against the caregiver are to be expected.Another thought is to get her a pet. Kittens are in favor, but I have had a lot of experience with small birds. When my mother was eighty her constant companion was a talking African Gray parrot (very expensive but well worth every penny - arguably, the most intelligent of the bird species) and she also enjoyed the company of a ferret. Parakeets are wonderful, but you need to purchase a hand-tamed one (in the U.S. these sell for from $75 to $150), rather than the $4.99 special.And as a final choice some large fresh-water Goldfish.The job of feeding the animal every day and the interaction provides meaning to an elder person's life.	post_8409923
post_8415691	Oct 12, 2012	187666	None	None	Although she has lost the will (she hides things so robbers won't get them) I kept the power of attorney paperwork as well as the old wills before my dad died. The POA is set up that I will have authority to handle her affairs if 2 doctors determine she is unable to do it herself. If she recovers (say it was a stroke) then the power would be returned to her. Not sure how it will all work out.She does have a dog. The poor thing is filthy but she does remember to feed it. She adores the dog more than me LOL but the dog doesn't ever disagree with her.    Funny, when I went over to the house, the dog would grab my pants leg and pull me into the room and roll all around in front of me looking for attention. This has been a recent change in behavior for the dog. I don't do dog mind reading but I do think she is lonely.I'm thinking I'll send her a "thinking of you" card next week just to keep the door open for contact if she chooses. This way she will have the option of reading the card or tossing it. Control is very important to her. A phone call is intrusive and makes her angry. I'm still thinking this over.	post_8409923
post_8421870	Oct 15, 2012	187666	144586	caregiver222	Just a quick update: my mom called me this morning acting as if everything was normal. Asked me where her keys are (as if I would know). I asked about the keys by the front door and she said they are missing. I asked about the set of car keys that have everything on them but she can't find them. All she has is the key to the doggy yard out back. I suggested some places to look, places she's put them before but that was all I could do. She asked about my bleeding kidneys, what has the doctor said. And that was about it.She has a doctor appt. this Friday, I asked how she wanted to handle that. Never did get an answer; she just rambled. So I dropped it. I did call her doctor back and let them know that she contacted me. I'm really not handling this well.	post_8409923
post_8423087	Oct 15, 2012	144586	None	None	You are doing a good job under impossible circumstances. I would suggest you keep a log of bizarre behavior, because the situation may be headed towards eventual institutionalization. Such a lot will be useful in that event. One question is whether the nature of the dementia has been identified. There are many different etiologies. Some types of dementia are nutritionally related, some are structural (tumor, for example) while others are due to a degradation in micro-circulation.    In other cases the causation is a mystery. In most cases the doctors don't take the time to make a differential diagnosis.    It is important for you to have a medical proxy and request copies of her records. Unfortunately a patients psychiatric records are most important and most psychiatrists will not release them except to another psychiatrist. There are exceptions. You can find semi-retired psychiatrists who will do so. They are hard to find. See if you can get her to take cod liver oil every day. The new flavored ones taste quite palatable, and they do improve circulatory function. You have my sympathies.	post_8409923

Since it's not a fire safe, it would be fine to drill a couple of holes into the bottom of the box and insert screws through those and onto the shelf to keep it secure.	post_8384189
post_8383053	Oct 02, 2012	144586	None	None	In general, in U.S. federally subsidized housing for the elderly, about a week after the person's death a so-called "ten day notice" will be mailed, from an atrorney, generally to "John Doe" or "Jane Doe" at that address terminating residency. Meanwhile you are organizing a funeral and mourning. No time for the apartment.    The document demands surrender of the apartment after the tenth day. They will probably tape it to the door. Clearly this does not allow for a proper inventory of contents or an orderly removal of the deceased property. If you go to the managing agent they will tell you that the unit has been renting at 25% of it's market value, and since you are not covered by the law, you may stay an additonal 30 days if you pay them four times the rent (the market value - in advance). Otherwise they will tell you to be out.    Get out the violin because they will tell you about a 92 year old lady who is on the waiting list you are depriving of the right to live in a senior apartment. Yes them to death and be polite. Tell them you have to speak to your brother-in-law, who is an attorney. Then ignore them. In the small print in the eviction notice it will state "if you do not vacate legal steps will be taken to evict you". That's "due process". It means you will have a court date set for from ten days to two weeks after that date. Two days before the court date go to housing court and request an "all-purpose adjournment". That will buy you another two to three weeks. If after that time the apartment is still not cleared, show up with a medical note for a second adjournment. That gives you two more weeks. It is important that someone live in the apartment during this period. If someone shows up with a key tell them you have legal possession until a judge says otherwise and if they enter or remove anything you will call the police and have them arrested. Now you will have to get out, but this will give you a minimum of an additional month (or more) to secure the posessions of your loved one.	post_8379415

And bouncing his rear up the stairs is not an option. There will come a time when he has to come back down too.A lift is a possibility but not practical since you're talking about bringing him home tomorrow. He said you should talk to the health care professionals about this. They may have trained people that can transport him safely up the steps.I hope Caregiver stops by soon with some helpful instructions or advice.	post_8355695

post_8359041	Sep 24, 2012	144586	None	None	I assume he is being released from a hospital. What you need to do is to get him into a rehabilitation nursing facility equipped to deal specifically with these problems. There are two kinds. One is an accelerated rehab and the other is more drawn out. You can't switch once you start in one program., I am dismayed that the hospital has not provided you with more guidance. I am in the process of arranging for an 82 year old recovering from hip surgery to enter such a facility. You also need to see what "certificates off necessity" he may be eligible for. There is a catalog on the internet. The ambulance crew will bring him up the steps. If he intended to leave the house you will require either a ramp or a chair to move him up and down. Electric elevator chairs are quite expensive, but ocasionally you see them at auctions. I bid on two such stair-elevator units, crated, with track,    brand spanking new from a municipality that went for $250. Retail they would have gone for $12,000. I have also seen them at nursing home bankruptcy sales.	post_8355695
post_8329968	Sep 14, 2012	144586	None	None	Elderly patients with swallowing disorders often have symptoms that are circadian in nature. That is to say regulated by the "body clock". With my little one at age 102, she could swallow at night, but not during the afternoon. Scheduling meals at 9 P.M. was helpful.    I cannot explain the reason for this, but it was meticulously documented. Thus any "test" for swallowing, before considering a PEG,    should be repeated several times during a 24 hour cycle. A swallow test should include a variety of liquids. As an example, another one of my little ones "failed" her swallow test because the doctor tested her (I wasn't there) with cranberry juice, which she detests and is allergic to. She swallowed lemonade quite well.	post_8323650
post_8300545	Sep 04, 2012	144586	None	None	There are many issues in play here, however one common factor in dealing with the enfeebled elderly is often the feeling of helplessness they have and this helplessness is self-treated by attempting to exercise control, often in very small ways, after others. This can involve orchestration of little dramas such as the one involving the credit card.    For example I have been involved with a half-dozen seniors that invariably "cancel their appointments" with physicians after I have made them. Being contrary-minded or obstinate is another way of making their impact known. For the most part, loved ones simply have to go along with this. It is very frightening to be old, feeble, have no authority any longer in the work environment, or the world at large, and not be able to partake in the ongoing process.	post_8293843
post_8302299	Sep 05, 2012	187666	144586	caregiver222	Thanks for the reply. I do my very best to allow her to make all her own decisions when I'm with her. She wants to get things done, I let her decide what we shall do first, second and so on. Does she want to make an appt? Would she like me to make the call? (she has trouble using the phone). I do think she should be seen by a doctor to find out what's going on physically (pain, lump on her spine, enlarged lump in her neck, etc.) so I get worried when she cancels the appt.I recognize some drama when we're out and she shuffles along and asks me to read soup can labels. Yeah, it's for attention since she can read them at home. But I'm having a hard time knowing what should worry me and what should I ignore. I guess I'll have to let nature take its course. The day/night she goes wandering alone in the neighborhood will be a turning point. She's already been cheated by yard men and a neighbor. Just hope nothing horrid happens.	post_8293843

post_8297910	Sep 03, 2012	187666	None	None	Has he checked in with his cardiologist recently? Has he had a recent change of medication? Some heart meds will cause extreme fatigue for a few weeks till the body adjusts. His pacemaker should be keeping his heart rate up to a fairly normal speed (usually 65 - 70 bpm). If he's having bloating, he may need diuretics to control that or need an increase if he's already on them. That's something he should ask his doctor. And I'm sure his cardio has mentioned cutting back on his sodium intake. Overall it sounds like he's dealing with heart failure but only his cardio can tell him about that. If his meds are not helping, he needs to go back and explain what's happening. His condition can be improved even if he's not "cured."	post_8297169

It would be important to speak to his treating physician about how to address that as when that happens to that extent it is not good for a person's health. Also as he has multiple diagnoses it would be important to discuss the reasons some of the medications were prescribed as there are    noted concerns about the use of antipsychotics for people who have dementia. His doctor should be able to appropriately adjust and/or change his medication regime to best help him while managing side effects within his clinical discretion.	post_8677951

The wrong drugs administered can give rise to a bladder problem and of course should not be given to patients who have, for example, dementia.This is what I am suing today three major Hospitals in California and over 26-doctors and nurses etc., who were bent on fraud and in a conspiracy to commit fraud and who generally get away with it even if in our case those becoming defendants were generally all "Tagalog" Doctors and Nurses who were close enough to do the things that they knowingly did wrong and who thought that they could get away with it but no they will    not and it is their turn to take the poison that they had given to the patient falsely and of course none of what they did or didn't do came out right in their "Hospital fact documents" that mean nothing legally when fraudulently orchestrated by the group from "outside" the USA who dominated medicine in, for example, KP/MV-CALIFORNIA. good old USA. In the USA we are to easy on criminals with to many "do-gooders" stepping in for the criminal all the time just ask the NAACP, for one example of so many "Non-profits" across the USA making BIG money for the causes that they allege are "Just causes."Captain Kelly, D.I.

My brother who lives in CA. told me same thing, so i went out , & bought the movie. Lets say u were both right! I kept on fighting for my rights, & finally i knew i was right. My counciler tried to tell me i couldnt move out of the state. I could not get medical care in my state, so i was going to N.Y. to get medical care, 200 miles away! Also, another woman told me same thing, who worked for dept. of aging. It all started when my first primary care doctor, altered my medical records, but i noticed he had dates wrong on my heart attack, & my religion. I questioned him, & a few months later, i got a letter in the mail, saying he was moving on, to another state, to take care of his parents. I filed a report with medicare, & they told me once a doctor moves out of state, nothing can be done to that doctor. He was the only 1, that was smart enough to do so. I cant finish this letter right now, cas i am shaking to much, BUT, my incident, also involves 3 hospitals, numerous doctors, etc. The last hospital almost got away with legally killing me, by telling me to do Abilify. Since they were saying i couldnt go to CA., I brought CA. to VT.(my brother). After a week, took myself out of that hospital, & stopped the Abilify. I ended up with a brain bleed, enlarged prostate, & 2 eye diseases, & more. Will finish this post later, when i feel better later. Also my mind is going. Cant even do simple multification.

In the meantime you probably could inform his doctor even if they could not tell you anything in return. Also speak to the pharmacy that prescribes the medications about this. Its important to know as a fact that this decision was his doctor's and not his sister's decision and that any medications that are being changed and/or discontinued are done so within a strict titration schedule under medical supervision.	post_8717520

His doctor could help with writing a medical letter of support that would be needed. There are other supports and services he could be eligible for as well. Also there is specific assistive technology that might be of help. The dementia itself might make him not realize he needs help at this point. However there are pragmatic ways to provide the help he needs and keep his best interest in mind.Also ask his treating physician more about what his long term prognosis is so you can plan out how to assist him in the future as well. Also there are support groups that can be of help and books that help with concerns about assisting    a person with dementia and coping skills.	post_8678875

I lived with my grandad for just over 5 or so years after he was diagnosed, before we had to put him in a nursing home.He used to drive me to school when i was was in primary every day, but after a while had to stop, because he would have small crashes and he would speed. My mum and grandma said one day that enough was enough and that we weren't taking any chances. Although it took alot of heart to force him to give up his license, seeing he was reluctant and didnt believe he was sick, it was for the best. He would start to cry, and it made you feel so bad, but when you think about, you are doing it for his safety.You will know when the time comes that you will have to make that huge step.I would also suggest those support groups mentioned in the previous post. My grandad attented those, and i believe it is a good chance for them to get out of the house for a while.Although this all does depend on what stage he is at with this dementia, once he starts to get bad, please don't hesitate to do whatever you have to to provide for him, etc.P.S I also do not believe he should be livign alone is he is in that state, depending if he is in danger of himself or not....I wish you luck.	post_8678875

post_8469481	Oct 30, 2012	1573625	None	None	What kind of dementia? From alz.org: Those who have a parent, brother, sister or child with Alzheimerâ  s are more likely to develop the disease. The risk increases if more than one family member has the illness. When diseases tend to run in families, either heredity (genetics) or environmental factors, or both, may play a role.Exercise is a good way to prevent dementia. It improves blood flow to the brain. Diet may also help. A Mediterranean with relatively little red meat and many whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and shellfish, and nuts, olive oil and other healthy fats may help prevent AD.For some reason people in India get less AD than others. One theory is that it is their diet that is high in curcummin (from curry) which helps prevent AD due to its anti-inflammatory properties. People who engage in intellectual activities such as reading, playing board games, completing crossword puzzles, playing musical instruments, or regular social interaction show a reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease.	post_8469057

There are numerous causes of dementia and Alzheimer's is but one cause. Nutritional deficiency, retroviral infections, tumors, strokes, and atheroschlerosis are other possibilities. Medications, especially those that lower cholesterol, have also been suggested as possible causes (memory is stored in cholesterol-like substances). While it may be statistically true that Alzeimer's patients have a higher incidence in a family this is not necessarily true for the many other etiologies for dementia.	post_8469057

In particular, primary amenorrhea is when a girl has not yet started her monthly periods and is older than 15 years old. This could be due to hormone problems as well as anatomical issues such as blockages or narrowing of the cervix    and sometimes, the cause is not known. To determine the underlying cause, further evaluation may need to be done by your doctor. Blood tests and imaging studies may also be done.Take care and do keep us posted.	post_8604276

Normally one of the chromosomes is expected to get deactivated while cells that have two chromosomes may function well while in others even the single chromosome may get deactivated, on the other hand all male cells with single X chromosome do not develop the condition as well and mosaics have variable degrees of involvement.Take care!	post_8487552

The genetic screening ultrasound during this time is a screening test and not a diagnostic test which gives information if a mother is at risk of carrying a baby with a genetic disorder. A genetic counselor usually gives the risk factor for chromosomal abnormalities based on the test results and may warrant additional testing for making a diagnosis.    The cause is usually die to genetic or acquired issues during the first trimester. It is best that you discuss the results with your doctor for proper evaluation.

post_8572918	Dec 01, 2012	526144	4299972	chikosprincess	Hi,How are you? An ovarian cyst    diagnosed in early pregnancy may be caused by a variety of issues. One kind is    due to a physiological cyst known as the corpus luteum    which is a normal finding    during this time. This usually    resolves spontaneously after the first trimester and will not have any adverse effect on the pregnancy. Depending on the initial findings, repeat scan may be performed to monitor the cyst. However, if an ovarian cyst ruptures, twists or if there is bleeding into the middle of the cyst, further evaluation may need to be done. It is best that you discuss the results of your scan with your doctor to ease any worry. Take care and do keep us posted.	post_8500566

Aside from the last menstrual period, ultrasound and physical examination will help determine a more reliable conception date.

From what I remember (I may be a little rusty on some of this info) if you are type A you can have either 2 A components or an A component and an i component(AA or Ai).    So when you have kids they get one of the components from each parent (AA, Ai, or ii depending on what each parents components are).    If your child is type O, then you and your husband would be Ai +Ai and your child inherited both i components making them type O (which is ii)Hopefully I explained this clear enough for you to understand and as simply as I could (they're not actually called "components" but it was the easiest way for me to explain it).Laura	post_8406265

Your high blood pressure may be due to primary or secondary causes and needs to be checked by your doctor. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as amount of water and salt in your body; the condition of your kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels; and the levels of different body hormones.

However, to determine the cause, the genetic testing result would be very helpful. Congenital absence of muscles is sometimes associated with other deformities.

post_8719909	Jan 11, 2013	585414	346125	JenniferTaylor728	Some of the more minor concerns you are describing may be temporary side effects of the medications.    For example some of the medications you are taking can cause temporary movement disorders (especially if they vary during the day), ECT over can as you stated over time cause memory loss. The more severe and marked changes you are describing are most likely related to the findings they have from the MRI but only a neurologist would understand the clinical specifics. It would be essential to see a neurologist on a regular basis so they could keep track of what is happening and follow up with it and treat it.

Search for saliva candida test on YouTube. Then if positive, go for further testing or just do the anti-candida diet. (again Coconut oil is recommended as the top Anti-fungal agent. Works BETTER than prescribed meds!)-* Food intolerances , sensitivities and allergies.Do Dr. Coca's Pulse test. free download or visit a NAET or "Allergy Antidotes" Doctor or Practitioner. (holistic allergy elimination)-EMF Pollution.Get an EMF detector and avoid exposure.- Neuro-transmitter deficiencies.Did you get tested for these? This could be a challenge.Acetylcholine, epinephrine, norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, melatonin, both D- and L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, glycine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), adenosine and ATP plus other nutrients including minerals play an important role in brain health.Correcting the deficiencies by proper nutrition and dietary supplements.- *Heavy metals toxicity.Comprehensive Detoxification every few months.Go to Jon Barron's website for a good tutorial in simple language,regarding detox.-Digestive, G/I and elimination issues.All these systems along with organs like kidney, liver and bowel may produce toxicity when their functions are impaired, leading to brain issues.Poor diet, inadequate hydration, stress, toxicity,constipation, allergies, yeast overgrowth,will affect all these systems and consequently the brain.Look into the SCD program for that. It's a challenge though for many to stick withthis program as it is strict!!* Meditation is a great way to distress and empty the mind!it might work wonders for memory.Just get a good CD with binaural sounds, or go to YouTube for    meditation video clips. I like Sonia Choquette a lot and she has many YouTube videos.Hope this helps and please post again anytime!Cheers!Niko	post_8719051

You can speak to your psychiatrist about that as they would be the best one to advise you as to appropriate follow up and treatment. In the meantime you could also contact agencies such as the national brain injury foundation who could give you some information about supports and services and accommodations that might be of help. Think what areas you might need assistance with    the most or have concerns about.Also some pragmatic suggestions would be to use reminder devices such as times to take mediciations and every day tasks you need to follow up on. Keep thingsyou might need to access easiily such as keys in a readily and easily identifiable place.

post_8303219	Sep 05, 2012	None	3239434	Pkumarkv	Hi    Pkumarkv.If you look up "cerebral cortex" you will find out that it'a a layer of neural tissue,about 2-4 mm thick surrounding    the brain and related to memory, language,attention, thought, and other functions. Depending where the damage is, as there are up to 6 different layers, each with its own makeup of neuronsand connections, some of these functions will be impaired.The non-specificity of location of the atrophy from your MRI results-diffuse meaning generalized- only allows for speculation that your memory issues are connected to this.As far as septum pellucidum deviation-go to gray720.png for a Gray's Anatomy image- there seems to be no specific function associated with thispart of the brain other than blood transfer. So any narrowing of the space may have some constricting effects perhaps contributing to some of your issues.As I mentioned in my other post the newer SPECT testing shows blood flowin motion, for more accurate brain diagnostic work.The Memanine hcl is a drug prescribed for mlid Alzheimer's Disease,however, there's very little evidence that    it's effective!The alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine piracetam    is a nutraceutical supplement that theoretically enhances over time brain function.Please read my replies in this forum and also in the Alzheimer's Communityfor more information.Take care.Niko	post_8296587

post_8485377	Nov 04, 2012	1050827	None	None	When I'm stressed or depressed, I'll forget words or mix them up.    My sentences will be a bit jumbled.    It won't be every second of being stressed or depressed, but it does happen.    Just because someone doesn't "act stressed" doesn't mean the person isn't stressed, by the way.    So many people have a view of either, "I need to suck it up and deal with it," or that it's a weakness to display it or even that it helps them to just not deal with it that they hide it to appear normal and not stress other people out with concern for them.	post_8484528

I really appreciate you taking the time.We are still waiting for the blood test results and then we will take it from there.The brain is obviously a very complex thing. I am myself becoming anxious about what could be wrong with her.90% of the time things are fine, its just now and again she says something that doesn't quite make sense.Again, thank you.Paul	post_8484528
post_8494556	Nov 07, 2012	4259889	None	None	Her blood tests have come back normal. We have booked another appointment to ask for a CT Scan (this was recommended by a GP friend)Generally she seems well. Still confusing things occasionally but that is it. She is more than able to carry on with work and other day to day activities.We will continue to look into this...	post_8484528

I don't have the answer to your question but if you know there is somebody out there with the same problem, it could make you fill better, well, I occasionally forget the little things even those that I have been told _short term memory loss " well I changed my diet, I do more sports    and reduced my stress so it's better than it was. before . I used to freak out alot when I couldn't remember something that occurred a few minutes ago or what I had been sent for! Well I am alot better.    I guess the reducing stress, struggling to pay utmost attention to my surroundings, exercising& going vegetarian has helped me alot. Otherwise, I wish you the best	post_8484528

A complete nutritional panel, tissue mineral analysis and neurotransmitters.How is your blood pressure? Any injuries or traumas?Do you use recreational drugs? Alcohol?Do you know if you have any allergies?You can do Dr. Coca's Pulse test for allergies and sensitivities. Free download for self-test.Have you been tested for Candida fungal infection? You can do a YouTube search for "Saliva test for candida". Very easy and fast.Look into Hypnotherapy for stress and anxiety reduction.Cheers!Niko	post_8530384

That is where your brain is to big for your skull,so it grows down and forms like a tonsil into where your spinal cord and nerves go down your back. Your brain actually grows out of the skull.I have been on vicodon for 3 years now but my Dr. doesn't want me to have the surgery yet although my tonsil is 10 cinameters, I think that's what they call it long. The only way they can find is with a MRI    They also call this BRAIN TONSILS. It might be in your best interest to ask your Dr. about it.

post_8515335	Nov 13, 2012	1050827	None	None	There is such a thing as a TIA (transient ischemic attack), which resembles a stroke in how it works but reverses itself within about 24 hours if I remember correctly on the time frame.    However, please note that one of the hallmarks of a stroke or stroke-like event is the inability to speak in coherent sentences, can't stick out the tongue, facial weakness on one side, etc.    You mention there was no sign of the last two and I don't see anything that would indicate he had issues with speech, just with memory.    My instinct is this is something else.However, without having taken him to a doctor during this time as you probably should have since it was odd behavior and could have been something serious, there's no way to know for sure without those test results.I would have him go in for a full physical (and push for an early date with mention of what happened) and make sure he reports this incident so a doctor's professional insight can be added to this situation.	post_8514094
post_8531008	Nov 18, 2012	1530171	4325540	lah731	Hey lah731.Welcome to the forum.For starters, to my opinion this should be investigated thoroughly and ASAP!An MRI or CT scan or even better a SPECT scanwhich is a more dynamic imaging procedure that measuresblood flow, may help get some answers.Possible underlying causes would be TIA -as pointed out by thatquietgirl-Low grade(2 or 3) Brain Aneurysm or PTSD.Alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, anxiety, copper deficiency, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure are some of the possible contributing factors. Addressing    the ones present - it is rather easy to verify this - would be of great preventive value, for the time being until a firm diagnosisis given and also for the long term, regardless of the treatment offered.In regards to PTSD, Energy Psychotherapy is by far    the most effectiveand efficient Therapy for PTSD.END OF PART 1	post_8514094
post_8531010	Nov 18, 2012	1530171	4325540	lah731	PART 2A study conducted in 2009 by Diepold and Goldstein,    determined that energy therapy shows promise as a treatment for PTSD:"This study examined a group of veterans with PTSD and their family members, and after five days of daily treatment with energy therapy, the group no longer scored positive on standard military measures of PTSD. A one-year follow-up found that the group had maintained their gains. In addition, energy therapy treatment resulted in significant improvements in other co-occurring measures of psychological distress, including anxiety and hostility. The breadth and severity of psychological problems also decreased significantly, with gains maintained at follow-up."The study concluded that although the 5-day intensive treatment delivery protocol used in this study involves a considerable commitment of resources, the alternatives are more costly. The medical and economic costs to society of PTSD sufferers, who would otherwise face many additional years of impaired functioning, are substantial. Energy therapy merits consideration as a treatment for PTSD and co-morbid conditions in veterans and other at-risk populations."If you need any more details, as I'm familiar with this field, please post again or send me a message.Wishing you both well.Niko	post_8514094
post_8465702	Oct 29, 2012	1530171	4187621	Aakash71	Hi Aaakash and welcome to the forum.Anomic aphasia seems to have a very strong neuronal inflammation origin,as the majority aphasia types respond to TNF (tumour necrosis factor-a group of inflammatory chemicals) inhibitors. I have a suggested holistic approach to this.As far as your geospatial orientation disability, I have to continue another time.Hang in there and I'll reply soon again.Cheers! gtg!Niko	post_8439631
post_8471758	Oct 30, 2012	1530171	4187621	Aakash71	The geospatial orientation disability, may have to do with the function of the Hippocampus in relation to space. Theta wave activity (4-7 Hz) at the CA1 -just do a search    for Cornu Ammonis area 1 to see an image- , seems to be of interest as theta oscillations have been correlated to spatial navigation.Any significant lesion in the EC (entorhinal cortex) -->CA1    pathway, may be the direct cause of impairment, affecting spacial cognition, among other fuctions. An MRI would indicate such a finding.Long term stress is another factor, contributing to Hippocampus deterioration, being one of the most vulnerable parts of the brain.I can't comment with much specificity, since there's very little detail to go by, however, if you wish to offer more information, perhaps I can come up with some more accurate analysis.What happened before the onset of your symptoms, MRI results, other tests, medications, lifestyle, work and work environment, exercise and fitness, food habits, emotions, traumatic past events, etc.Take care.Niko	post_8439631
post_8490850	Nov 05, 2012	4187621	1530171	Nikodicreta	Thanks NikoThis in itself is awful information. I just cannot say that these symptoms had any past history of events. I believe I always had them. The only distinguishing history is that as per narrations, when I was born I was blue for a while and did not breathe, suggested reasoning was strangulation of neck by umblical cord...and the only post birth effect I till date have is serious level of bilateral sensori-neuronal hearing loss in both ears....don't know if these could be related to each other and to my two symptoms stated in this community post (inability to recall names/words and inability to orientate in a city without maps)...do you have any idea ?Aakash	post_8439631
post_8493659	Nov 06, 2012	1530171	4187621	Aakash71	Aakash, of course this new information you posted, has a lot to do withyour condition.First, while neck strangulation by umbilical cord, is a misleading expression, since the breathing is done through the umbilical cord itself, the proper expression in regards to any sustained oxygen and blood deprivation, would be " severe umbilical cord compression" to my opinion.And this in itself could be the cause of some neuronal damage, possiblyresulting in some post birth cognitive impairment.I mentioned in my previous post, that spatial navigation is linked to thetabrain wave oscillations.Therefore any serious deficit connected to this process, such as    Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing loss,    could be a factor in your Geospatial orientation disability.This type of hearing loss in your case, I suspect, is because of abnormalities in the main processing centre of the brain.Unfortunately, there are no clear answers to shed more light, however, if I were you I would take a serious look into brain plasticity.I have read "The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science" by Norman Doidge.I recommend it, as a starting resource, for some valuable insight, that may    help make some difference in your life.Take care.Niko	post_8439631

post_8474612	Oct 31, 2012	1530171	4250741	cindytlegirl	Hey Cindy.Welcome to the forum.It's unfortunate that health care personell    and doctors ignore the suffering and serious health issues, dismissing patients on the basis that the tests they conduct are not showing anything.You may benefit from a SPECT scan, which will show blood flow in the brain, as sometimes the damage from various sources can be indicated by this brain imaging process, where an MRI may not show anyhting significant.Adult Cerebral Hypoxia- cerebral hypoxia occurs when brain is deprived ofoxygen for    several minutes, will not show on MRIs and SPECT scans and should be investigated properly to my opinion.Hope this helps.Wishing you well.Niko	post_8473926
post_8465082	Oct 29, 2012	1530171	1459923	GaMan	Hey GaMan.This strictly my opinion. You have been wasting your time and moneyon tests and treatments that haven't worked and probably will not work, nor give any useful answers.And building an immunity with allergy shots, it's like a vaccine that you're injected with for a very large number of various strains of flu. Not happening.First this has not been invented yet, and second, your body wouldn't be able to handle it.Let's face it. When we go to the health care system for help, we are not patients, we are customers. It's a mainly profit industry, true health deliveryis a very distant secondary activity by chance. If it wasn't for our Inner ability to heal and our Intelligent immune system to keep everything in check, the medical system would be bankrupt, as drugs never cure anything.My suggestion is to do the Dr. Coca's Pulse test- full version - it's a free download. It deals with a fifth group of allergies that modern medicine does not explore at all!My other suggestion is to find yourself a NAET (Dr Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Techniques) or "Allergy Antidotes" Doctor or Practitioner.The pressure and headaches are probably related to your intolerance or Allergies in regards to something ingested probably hidden or delayed allergies that are non- IgE reactive.Migraine headaches are often caused or triggered by delayed food allergies or sensitivities. A few years ago a study showed that 85% of migraine sufferers experienced migraine relief after eliminating specific foods.Please post again with your comments or questions.Wish you well.Niko	post_8451808

post_8458877	Oct 26, 2012	4157590	1530171	Nikodicreta	I have wanted to get a spect test, but the counselor I went to said I would have to be referred to someone	post_8425444
post_8459264	Oct 26, 2012	1530171	4157590	iwantanswersnow	It probably has to do with insurance and payment.If you are paying, trust me, they will accept you w/o any referral.For a better understanding, visit Dr. Amen's website, very well designed,that gives a ton of info on anything you want to know regarding spect imaging,brain oriented treatments for wide range of issues, from attentional problems, anxiety issues, mood problems, autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, addictions, obesity, memory, learning and behavioral problems.Note: This is not a recommendation. I have no dealings and no personal experience with Dr. Amen's Clinics. My suggestion is given with the intention of you getting more info and details in this area of brain health.Cheers!NikoPS.It seems that you are striking out with your counsellors, so far!	post_8425444
post_8423841	Oct 16, 2012	4154162	4153723	eck2012	Hi ECK,I had very similar symptoms to yours. I had a very difficult time remembering things; my thought process was scattered, to say the least. Often times I felt cold, and slow. I was only comfortable bundled up in a blanket while sitting by my heater vent. My appetite was almost non-existent and I had an uncontrollable urge to chew on rubber, plastic and dried nail polish. I began developing white spots on my gums and tongue and I began to bruise easily. I was extremely tired all the time. Even gathering the strength to walk to the restroom was difficult for me to do. I slept very well at night, and I'd sleep most of the day, but I was always so tired. It wasn't until I doubled over in excruciating abdominal pain one night & practically passed out, that my husband rushed me to the local ER. There it was determined that my hemoglobin was 5.8 and my ferritin levels were less than 1. I was admitted to the hospital and given four units of blood, thus increasing my hemoglobin to 8.0. My ferritin levels increased after a series of Veinofer infusions over a number of weeks. Evidentally, I had lost a lot of blood from bleeding ulcers in my small intestine (I have Crohn's Disease). Interestingly enough, I always felt like Wonder Woman after each blood transfusion and iron infusion. My life followed that patteren for about six years, until earlier this year. That's when I had the affected segment of my small intestine removed. I now have an ileostomy and my quality of life is much better. Maybe you can ask your doctor about possible anemia? Have you had your hemoglobin checked, or your ferritin levels? I hope I've been some help to you. Good Luck!	post_8423677
post_8424530	Oct 16, 2012	4153723	4154162	Gerti12	Thanks for the support Gerti.I've already had my hemoglobin checked and it was found to be normal. Also, my doctor checked my eyes and told me that I don't have signs of anemia.I'll have my ferritin levels checked as well and will let you know about the results.Thx for helping out.	post_8423677
post_8426773	Oct 16, 2012	4154162	4153723	eck2012	No problem at all. Yes, please keep me posted.Be well! =)	post_8423677
post_8430051	Oct 17, 2012	1530171	4153723	eck2012	Hey eck2012.Your doctor correctly did not prescribe any meds because of your high sed. rate.This test only measures the speed of the red blood cells falling at the bottom of a test tube in an hour.    Certain imbalances and conditions in the body prompt the production of some proteins in the blood, causing the red cells to stick together and drop to the bottom. The faster they drop the higher the sed. rate and the higher the systemic inflammation or infection in the body. This test is not very reliable in lower numbers, but its reliability increases in the higher numbers. It is only indicative of infectious conditions and so-called auto-immune disease.What was the very high sed. rate?Have you been tested for Candida?You can do your own preliminary test at home if you wish.Just do a YouTube "saliva test for candida" search.If you test positive at home-takes very little time- then you canexplore this further with your PCP.Hope this helps.Keep us posted.Cheers!Niko	post_8423677
post_8341478	Sep 18, 2012	1530171	3737822	nellymike	Hi nellymike.Welcome to the forum.Your mom may need to be assessed.Can you get her to see a doctor or can she be taken to the E.R.if it's an emergency situation?Can you give more information of exactly what's going on with her?Did something just happen to her, or has this been going on for some time?Please post here again with some more details, so we can offer you some suggestions.Hang in there, there are always ways to do something and get her some help.Wishing you and your mom well.Niko	post_8341081
post_8345482	Sep 19, 2012	1050827	None	None	Definitely take her to the doctor (or get someone else to if you can't drive).    It can be a sign of things such as depression (my mother only suffered this and fatigue when she was depressed) or other more serious things.	post_8341081
post_8294685	Sep 02, 2012	1530171	3236490	dumbo1	Hey dumbo1.Welcome to the forum.There's nothing very specific nor significant to your memory issuesaccording to the info you provided from the MRI.I personally believe that MRIs are a bit limiting as the imaging is static.There's very little static about the brain, which is active in astronomicalproportions! The newer SPECT imaging I believe provides for greater Dx , preventive and treatment possibilities. But that's my opinion.The first part (ischemic folic) indicates some generalized neuronal damage from lack of oxygen stemming probably from blood flow constriction.Perhaps your tablet for life is a blood thinner.You should have this explored further to my opinion and find the cause, if possible.The second observation from the precentral gyrus, seems irrelevant, as thisis the main motor center of the brain which initiates movement by contraction of the muscles. Again I'm not a neuro-radiologist, nor do I have anything to go by, other than the info on your post.It is your right as a patient to have some clear explanation on this from your Neurologist. So, just for peace of mind, contact his office and find out.It's great that you did well with the cognitive memory assessment, however,I urge to get familiar with brain function, brain anatomy and pathology,as I find more and more, that the medical system is overburdened, doctors don't have much time to be thorough, to follow through with the leads and look into all the possibilities.Being knowledgeable and proactive makes a huge difference.A good resource for such information is from some of Dr. Amen's books, like "Change Your Brain, Change Your Life". He's written 28 books about the brain.Just do a search.Also have a look at my response to gergneslo earlier today in this forum.You may find some helpful information.One thing I personally do for brain health as well as for general health is consume extra virgin organic coconut oil daily!Hope this helps.Wish you well.Niko	post_8293299
post_8301466	Sep 05, 2012	3239434	1530171	Nikodicreta	hi:could you please me an answer to my query	post_8293299
post_8304474	Sep 05, 2012	3239434	1530171	Nikodicreta	thanks a lot	post_8293299
post_8313671	Sep 09, 2012	3236490	1530171	Nikodicreta	Hi NikoThanks for such    nice useful infor about my report.	post_8293299
post_8293630	Sep 02, 2012	None	3236571	gergneslo	Hey gergnelso.Welcome to the forum.There are many aspects of cognitive/mental/brain dysfunction thatcannot be accurately diagnosed by conventional medicine.The brain's complexity is of astronomical proportions-lol!Test results, often inconclusive, as they may not show clearlyany significant damage or change, make it difficult- for patientsand doctors alike- to lead a diagnosis and treatment.Here are some possibilities (followed by suggestions):-STRESS, as you correctly mentioned!Avoidance, Meditation, Hypnotherapy, EFT, Therapy.-Impaired Glucose uptake in the brain.Simultaneous EEG and [(18)F]FDG-PET testing is required to verify.Coconut oil -virgin and organic- is an excellent substitute. 2T dailyand build up to 4 in 4 weeks. I would try it anyway, in place of other oils -specially cooking oils as they are pro-inflammatory!    coconut oil is NOT!Visit the coconut research center website for details.-HypoglycemiaSelf test with a glucometer from any pharmacy. test frequently to establishpatterns according to food and drink intake.To correct this- if not already diabetic- just follow a pre-diabetic or diabetic diet.- Candida (yeast overgrowth)Do a self test -only indicative,NOT diagnostic!). Search for saliva candida test on YouTube. Then if positive, go for further testing or just do the anti-candida diet. (again Coconut oil is recommended as the top Anti-fungal agent. Works BETTER than prescribed meds!)-Food intolerances , sensitivities and allergies.Do Dr. Coca's Pulse test. free download or visit a NAET or "Allergy Antidotes" Doctor or Practitioner. (holistic allergy elimination)-EMF Pollution.Get an EMF detector and avoid exposure.- Neuro-transmitter deficiencies.Did you get tested for these?Acetylcholine, epinephrine, norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, melatonin, both D- and L-aspartic acid, L-glutamic acid, glycine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), adenosine and ATP plus other nutrients including minerals play an important role in brain health.Correcting the deficiencies by proper nutrition and dietary supplements.-Heavy metals toxicity.Comprehensive Detoxification every few months.Go to Jon Barron's website for a good tutorial in simple language,regarding detox.-Digestive, G/I and elimination issues.All these systems along with organs like kidney, liver and bowel may produce toxicity when their functions are impaired, leading to brain issues.Poor diet, inadequate hydration, stress, toxicity,constipation, allergies, yeast overgrowth,will affect all these systems and consequently the brain.All this sounds good but CAN you and WILL you do it on you own ?My opinion seek the best Holistic Doctor or practitioner you can afford to facilitate this for you.It's probably you best bet!I    have probably missed a couple things, but this gives you a general holistic overview of your condition. Also I forgot to mention that breathing properly is vital. Go to the normal breathing website for details.Hopefully some of this information will help .It's a tough place to be where you are presently, but you can turn this around. I have helped many people in situations similar to yours with advice.In my opinion, this has a lot to do with the understanding that there are things you can do to improve, the ability to stay focused, and having the discipline and determination to follow through, even if it may take some time to see results.Please post again or pm me directly anytime if you have any questions.Take care and wish you well.Niko	post_8293388
post_8296068	Sep 03, 2012	3236571	1530171	Nikodicreta	Thankyou for that response. I wish I had that information 3 years ago but I have been relying completely on doctors which turned out to be a mistake. Strange that neurologist, psychologist, and psychiatrist never mentioned "Dementia". My symptoms definitely fall under that category. I think I should have been referred to a geriatrician along time ago since they appear to specialize with my type of problems.	post_8293388
post_8296258	Sep 03, 2012	1530171	3236571	gergneslo	Hey gergneslo. You are welcome!Dementia, doesn't quite fit your profile, as far I can judge from your posting,but mild cognitive impairment with significant stress relatedmemory decline, probably yes.Geriatricians perhaps would have helped you more, however,there are treatable parts of your impairment and memory decline,well outside the strict medical protocols, where a holistic approach, as I mentioned in my original reply, would make a difference, in prevention and improvement.There are many things that still can be done, so learn from the past,make some good decisions today, so you can have a better outlook fortomorrow.Cheers!Niko	post_8293388
post_8299062	Sep 04, 2012	3236571	1530171	Nikodicreta	I get the impression from what I have read on the internet that dementia is general catchall word for debilitating mental disorders. Altzheimers, PTSD, etc. Until a specific disorder is diagnosed, they tend to call it dementia.	post_8293388
