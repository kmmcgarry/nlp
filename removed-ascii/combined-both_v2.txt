Is Alzheimer Disease and dementia the same thing?    My mom has been diagnosed with dementia and    I understand that she will be taking a drug for this.    Is this as serious as Alzheimer's disease?My mother whom is 63yrs was diagnosed with Alzheimers 2 years ago.She has developed slurred speach usually first thing on a morning.The GP says that she has not had a stroke and that it is not phlegm/chest infection but it is due to her dementia.How advanced is her Alzheimers for slurred speach to occur? and will she start to deteriorate rapidly from now on?My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2003 but we believe she had been suffering for a year or two before that. She is currently in a Sunrise facility in Wilmington DE and I need to move her to a facility near me in the greater Atlanta area. My question is, has anyone moved an AZ or dementia patient a long distance like that and what are your suggestions for making the move as smooth as possible? I'll take any tips or suggestions you have to offer.My mother can not speak and is not oriented to much of anything. However, she can stand a move a bit and is not on oxygen. She really does not recognize anyone but some faces of her aids do seem familiar to her.Thanks for your help!My gf's mum who is 58 this year bathed multiple times this morning and everytime she came out of the bathroom, she claimed that she can't recall having already taken shower. She had similar situations like this in the past but not as bad as today. Could this be a symptom of dementia or Alzheimer's?Many thanks.First of all my biggest fear in the world is getting Alzheimers. So with that being said here is my query.I am not a big drinker at all. Maybe 4 glasses of wine a week, 2 at a setting. I also take Celexa 20 mg and Klonopin prn, but only use that whenever I have panic (every 14 days or so) The Celexa works.    I am 64, work full time, and for the most part I think my memory is pretty good.I went to dinner with some friends after taking a Klonopin .5 mg, and had 2 glasses of Merlot. I had a lovely time, A week later, I saw a guy in the diner who said hi, and he knew me. Said he had met me that night at dinner and we chatted, I pretended to know him because I did not want to appear rude or look odd/ I did ask him where he worked and he told me and I had a vague recognition of that topic.That scared the beJesus out of me. Should I be worried? Was that a blackout from mixing the two drugs, or is this a warning sign that I could be heading for dementia. My doc never mentioned not to have a drink when taking Klonopin. There is no dementia in my family by the way.My    gquestion has to do with    medication that is being administered to my stepfather with Alzheimers--he is being treated in a Geriatric Behavior Program at a hospital due to his formerresidemtial placement stating that he was aggressive.    He has been placed on Depoke, Seqoquel,Ativan    antoher antidepressent --not sure of spelling--Celexa or selexa.He has been in this program for 2 weeks--he has regressed to not feeding himself    nor is he eating--they are trying to feed him    (has never been feed--would take to resturant at least once a week) having not walking--has always walked a lotnever been placed in wheel chair until entering this facility,    he is also not as responsive--major decline--he is now having hallucinations.    I have never seen him in this level of decline--especially in 14 days.We are trying to meet with the Psychiatrist with no luck.    We have schuled a meeting for TuesdayNov 27, but have been informed that the nurse not the Dr would be there.    We are concerned thathe may not be able to do anything if this continures.    He does push away people and becomes agitated when he has to be changed (tolieting) and now that they are trying to feed him.I am looking for another facility to evaluate him,    planning to try University of North Carolina for help.Any info on medication used for aggression or irritability would    be of great help.At present:    Adivan 1 tab 3x day     Selexa    (Celexa) 20 mgDepoke 125    3xd    (not sure of dosage)Seroqual 50 mg at bedtime        25 2xdCelebrex     (has bad knee)If he gets aggressive (not sure what level ) they give him more/has also given it to him by injectionThis man has Alzheimer    or    a form of Dementia     he is not psychoticMy mother started showing signs of dementia when she was in her mid 50's.    No one in Mom's family had these type of symptoms at a young age. In fact, most lived into their 80's and 90's and were still living alone.    Because of that I wasn't convinced she had Alzheimers.    A relative told me about Picks.    He said it was caused by stress or abuse.    My mother was verbally and emotionally abused by my father their entire marriage. I could understand closing her mind to get away from him.I guess my questions are...Is this a true statement regarding Picks?Are Alzheimers or Picks inheirited?    (Sorry, I know that's spelled wrong)I'm getting close to the age my mother was when she first started exhibiting symptoms and am scared to death.    Every time I misplace my keys or forget someones name I panic, thinking that I'm getting one disease or the other.Can anyone help?    Mom passed away in February after suffering with this for over 20 years.    I need to know if I'm going to be imprisoned like Mom was.Thanks!GoldiebearHi allI am 30 years old female, doctor by profession . I have been suffering from this strange irritating problem (unbearable now) since my childhood that I forget minor things very easily specially the tasks assigned to me by someone else. I had always been a brilliant student all my life. I could easily remember the subject in examinations if I studied hard, otherwise I did have some problem retaining it. But if I have the concept I grab everything easily. I shall give you a few examples of my forgetfulness. believe me I never do that intentionally. I try my best not to forget.1. If someone used to ask me to bring my maths copy in the school the next day, I used to forget for many days unless I wrote it on my hand or something like that.2.    If someone tells me to bring something back while driving home, I forget, no matter how imporant that is.3. I forget to take my important documents with me if I am going to apply for anything like visa, job or important things like that.4. I forget to take my clinic keys if they are in a separate keyring other than the car keys'. And this happens almost 5/6 times a week if the keys are in a separate keyring.5. Now I have started forgetting the patient's name if I ask in the beginning of a session and I dont write it on the prescription , I have to ask it again :( I am so upset.6. I forget something everyday , lie I promise to call a friend after 15 mins and I forget. I forget to turn off the stove if I put something for cooking in the kitchen.In short, I forget all short term matters. I cant recall few simple words told to me by my brother. My long term memory is very good. Many friends of mine and my family had been very supportive but don't know how to deal with my inlaws with this problem. I look quite weak, dont look healthy and had very sensitive temprament all my life. I used to cry over small and big issues a lot. Now I ve reduced crying    a lot . I used to argue a lot over things which    have reduced a lot as well. Overall I am much more stable emotionally now but more upset with my forgetfulness. Despite of crying over small matters easily I had been very cheerful and like to be happy and witty.Do I have dementia?or Alzheimer's disease? if yes I am so much afraid that there is no diagnostic test available before I die ...any other problem    with me? how could I be so careless all my life?Why do I forget the special tasks only?what should I do?:o(amberSIRT1, a gene associated with anti-ageing has been linked to the production of an Alzheimer's protein according to a study in Cell.Researchers at MIT found that SIRT1 appears to prevent production of damaging A-beta peptides that make up amyloid plaques which form in the brain of people with Alzheimer's. They also showed that learning and memory improved when SIRT1 - protein was overproduced in the brain of mice engineered to develop Alzheimer's.SIRT1 is a \rescue gene\ that repairs the damage done by free radicals and prevents cells from dying prematurely. The gene also causes mitochondria, the power plants of cells, to produce energy at higher levels that are typically associated with younger cells.Alzheimer's Society comment:'SIRT1 certainly appears to be everybody's favourite gene at the moment. Activated by calorie restriction and a compound found in red wine, research has shown that it can help animals live longer. Now scientists may have linked it to the control of a key protein associated with the development of Alzheimer's-type dementia.''Much more research is now needed before we can find out if drugs that activate SIRT1 could be used to fight dementia. However, dementia research is desperately underfunded. Dementia receives eight times less funding than cancer research. If we are to beat dementia we must invest today to find a cure for tomorrow.'Dr Susanne SorensenHead of ResearchRef: SIRT1 Suppresses beta-Amyloid Production by Activating the alpha-Secretase Gene ADAM10,\ Gizem Donmez, Diana Wang, Dena E. Cohen, and Leonard Guarente. Cell, July 23, 2010.Source:Alzheimer's SocietyHello, just looking for any advice or experiences anyone can offer.My dad is 57. For the past two years he has been on disability leave because he started having memory problems and depression. We discovered this when 1) he received a letter from a lady he had rear-ended while working out of town but he had forgotten it had ever happened, and 2) One night while talking to my mom on the phone he started slurring and stuttering his words as if he were having a stroke. When this happened he was put in the psychiatric ward at the hospital for depression for a week. He came out his normal self.Since then he has slowly become worse. He would forget whole days at a time, movies he has seen, and what day it is even when you've already told him several times. He started having balance problems and would stumble a lot. He also had sleeping problems as well as changes in personality. He can't drive. He has problems with numbers and measurements. There have been days and weeks he has been almost back to normal, but then the symptoms start happening again. The longest he's been \normal\ has been about 4 weeks.This has been happening for two years but he wouldn't usually have all those symptoms at once. But over the past two weeks he has gotten really, really bad. He has fallen twice this week resulting in visits to the ER for stitches and a cat scan. There have been days lately where he slurs a lot and can hardly hold a conversation. He's also become really socially awkward... For example, my mom took him to McDonald's and he started yelling \I'm a pirate! Someone get me a sword!\ in a pirate accent. He talks and sings loudly. His voice just sounds crazy most of the time, even when he's saying something that makes sense or having a coversation with you. He cries a lot because he'll realize every now and then that something is really wrong but he can't fix it. He has trouble walking, sleeping, talking. For the past week he's had blurred vision (double vision) and he was in the ER for that too. But they sent him home.He's been treated for depression this whole time and has been taking large doses of depression medication. He had a PET scan which came up negative for Frontal-temporal Dementia. He's had several MRIs and CT scans which have shown no signs of brain tumors or strokes.He goes to a neurologist, psychiatrist, and psychologist. The neurologist says he is 90% sure that all of these symptoms and problems are a result of severe depression and anxiety. He says it is not a stroke, tumor, or dementia or early-onset Alzheimer's.The psychiatrist and psychologist both believe it HAS to be something other than just depression to be causing the physical problems he is having.We are so, so frustrated and heart-broken to see him this way. My mom is trying to get him into a specialty hospital (like MAYO clinic) and see if those doctors can help.If it's depression, then we just don't know how to treat it. The medication he is taking doesn't seem to be doing anything, and the neurologist just says to keep upping his doses. At this point we are a little tired of this doctor and are trying (under his supervision) to wean my dad off of all his medication and see if that helps at all.I don't know where else to look. We are so worried and don't know what to do, so if this really is all depression I'm just trying to find out what I can to help him. If it's Alzheimer's of Dementia, we would at least like to know. My sweet dad is so scared right now, and so is his family.Thank you for taking the time to read this, and advice or opinions are welcome.At age 53,my now 69 yr old husband had surgery for a benign brain tumor located between the the two frontal lobes of the brain requireing Laser Surgery. At that time he was told because of the heat generated in getting all of the tumor, he might at some later date, have some memory loss.    He has continued to work but in the last two years has noticed problems with memory. The work he    does    /did is detailed and requires concentration and memory. More recently, when in a stressful situation (not job related ) he became confused,unable to get facts straight/sorted out.    He also has a hard time making decisions.    He was abt. this same time    diagnosed with Chronic HBP and is on Lisinopril which is controlling it and seems to be helping. Fearing a return of the Tumor we consulted his Surgeon, had an EEG done, saw a top    Neurologist in our area, were prescribed Ativan &    Resperdal by two different doctors, neither of which he could tolerate. In fact he felt the Resperdal made things worse. From what the Drs. told us , at this time there is no sign of Tumor or Seizures or- they say- Dementia/Alzheimers.Could this spell of confusion have been a TIA ?    About    20 years ago, he had a spell of temporary l loss of sight in one eye, and tests showed his BP extremely high at that time. He was given a shot and sent home. The next day the Dr. told me \ I thought he was going to have a Stroke right in the office \. He tried meds to control it at that time but could not tolerate the meds.In all of these Dr. appts, he was never given a complete Physical Exam, nor were any tests done to check for blockage in arteries etc. Lab work ruled out Hypoglycemia ..He was told that HBP of long standing could affect memory.I guess my question is--just because Dementia was not found now, does that mean it will not show up in the near future.    From reading I've done it seems that heat generated by Lasix may \ seal off \ the brain cells causing problems ???Since we did not recieve any answers defineing the problem, I would appreciate your comments.thanks,    Junie 37MCI is the dx given to my husband by the Neuropsychologist. She also mentioned Chronic ischemic microvascular disease. I have NO idea what that means, unless it means small blood vessels in his brain are shutting down.My questions are overwhelming and I cannot ask my husband's neurologist because He [my husband] is very sensitive about the terms dementia and Alzheimer's.i read that most MCI patients go on to have an Alzheimer's dx within 5 yrs. Is this TRUE?I am really new to all this and having a hard time digesting and accepting all this.Thanks for any help you have to give.Our mother started not urinating. She also was constipated.    After being hospitalized twice and getting the run around I finally got them to address the real problem ( urinary issues)    They got her in with a Urologist he told us that Mom's bladdar is basically dead and does not function like it should. It wont squeeze. Same with bowels. He said urine just sits there and collects because she is bedridden and just lays there.    The cathiter would make it come out for the most part. There is now sand/crystals or substance making blockages because of this backing up of urine.I just want to know if this is a common thing with Alzheimers patients.She has history of Type 2 diabetes as well.    Several TIA's and when the bladdar was so full and she was unable to do a BM or Pee she suffered another TIA last month.The Urologist thinks that the stroke caused this problem but it was starting before the TIA we know about. I want to know if this is a common problem for dementia people?P.s please dont feel I don't appreciate a response. It may take a while for me to get time to read and respond. Have alot going on w/her and still raising two young kids. In advance thanks to anyone willing to respond.Hi, My father was detected with semantic demantia about a year back. He was having problems in identifying objects and spelling out the words. The MRI scan showed degradation of the brain and the neurologist confirmed semantic dementia and ruled out Alzheimers. He has been on a medication of Aricept 10 mg a day for the past 9 months along with his heart medication (ecosprin) post his bypass 4 years back. However since his neuro medication started, his condition has gone worse since earlier it was only about speech. Now his speech has gone much worse, ability to converse has gone down, and doing basic activities like shaving etc needs reminders. He has also started talking a lot to himself.Keeping these symptoms in mind, we took a second opinion and the new doctor completely stopped Aricept. He has instead precribed the following:(For morning & afternoon)1. Parkin-plus (hydrochloride tablets)2. Norwayz (Idebenone tablets 45 mg)3. Corus (Vitamins, mineals, fatty acids & amino acids)For night1. Sove IT 6.5 (Zolpidem Tartrate Extended-Release tablets)2. Folinine (Folic Acid, Methylcopalamin & Pyridoxine)3. Olimelt 5 mg (Olanzapine)The earlier symptoms like talking to himself, being always agitated etc. has gone down with these medicines. However his speech has turned slurry and made him quite inactive. If he gets up in the night, he doesnt remember to go off to sleep and keeps wandering in the house.I am confused because none of the medications is stalling the degradation. What step should I take now? Can I send you the reports to look at?Thanks for your help...I believe there is definately a good possiblity that my mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimers just because it was an easy diagnosis....however, within 3 months of my overtaking her care I saw before my eyes an extreme transformation into a bright, smiley, enjoying life woman.    She had lost her husband of 65 years and had become extremely depressed and the care she was under brought much fear to her....after 1 year she was given the MMSE test and her memory had not deteriorated at all...I have been researching possible causes for her short term memory loss, which was much of the time, selective, I have reason to believe that she suffered from Pseudo Dementia...Can you refer me to any medical studies or documented information on this subject....My mom has beginning alzheimer's / dementia she had a frontal bleed if she was treated right away what could of been done?I have Bipolar I Disorder.    I posted a question in my community (BP) about BP getting worse with age.    My delima is that my family has a history of both dementia and Alzheimer Disease on each side of my family.    With bipolar, I have been told, that left untreated, it can lead to dementia in patients.    Of course, now, I am being treated, and that's a very good thing.Do you know if Dementia and Alzheimer's is inherited?    Does anyone know of someone that had bipolar and it went into dementia?    I struggle with these questions and have gotten some really good responses in the BP community and know that kindling is a condition of untreated bipolar, but wanted a perspective from the Alzheimer community.ThanksRachealSo they've diagnosed my mother with dementia of Alzheimer's type after several years of looking for an answer.    I really don't believe this is the problem, it just doesn't make sense.    Is it at all possible that they misdiagnosed her and she had something like vitamin B12 deficiency?Hi - 2 years ago I went for some ear balance tests with a Neurologist.    In the CT scan he learned that I had some calcification in the brain.    I didn't ask any questions as I didn't think was a big deal.    Since that time, I have been experiencing times where I can't find the right words or I mumble a few words and literally find it difficult to remember things.    I also get anxiety when I am going to drive a distance....I wouldn't not be too worried, but my family has a history of Dimentia(dementia)and Alzheimers.    My mother passed a way one year ago from it and her brother prior to that and currently one other brother is in the latter stages of the disease.Additional concern is I had a had fall (slipped while at work in kitchen and fell head first slamming left lobe of head into wall (the office heard the bang came to my aid)....I went taken to emergency and Doctor said to follow the needed steps (wake up every 2hours) and asked if I played any active sports - I said no....Currently I am in employment transition and partially I like to believe this forgetfulness is more about stress....but then one never knows right?Should I be concerned and revisit this with Neurologist ?Any advice is appreciated.thank you.CI have a friend, who is renting from me, and is70 yrs. old, has dementia, taking oxycodone10 mg. several times a day.    He has beenacting like an alzheimers patient.    But friendssay it is the drug.    I can't get him or his dr.'sattention.    His doctor called me, he said, butI tried to return the call and she left for vacationwithout talking to me re: results of alzheimersscreening.    He said, she told him that the pillswere causing his problems and cut them wayback.    Checked the rx. and this is not true.He is very difficult with temper tantrums,what can I do.    He is uncooperative, somethingis very wrong?    Is it the pills or alzheimers.    HELP>Hi, my father had an MRI recently and the results listed as fairly prominent diffuse cerebral atrophy with increased CSF spaces. Otherwise negative examination.    What does this mean, the doctor mentioned Alzheimers, does this mean he will end up with dementia or Alzheimers?My mom and I are concerned about my 74 year-old father.    He has been experiencing short-term memory loss for the past 3 years.    This spring, my mom took him to the doctor for a series of tests.    They conducted an MRI to check for tumors or a possible stroke.    They also conducted an initial screening for Alzheimers and dementia.    Everything came back clear.    The doctors agreed that there is some short-term memory loss but not enough to warrant medication.A typical example of the type of memory loss he is experiencing includes the following:My husband, daughter and I recently met up with my mom and dad for a vacation in Florida.    We flew in and rented a car for the trip.    My father asked at least once a day if we liked our new car.    We patiently told him we did not buy the car - it was a rental.    It seems like new information doesn't get filed away correctly in his memory bank and, like a broken record, he keeps repeating his thoughts.My mom and I are wondering the following: 1) if there are any medications my father could be taking to help improve his memory, and 2) whether his current combination of medication may be affecting his memory.    He is currently on zocor (20ml/day) for cholesterol, methotrixate and folic acid for psoriasis, and takes a 81 mg aspirin per day to help thin his blood.    He had a pacemaker installed in 1993 (updated in 2002).Any thoughts or suggestions as to what we might explore with the doctors would be helpful. Thank you.I understand the basics of Alzheimer's disease, but I am curious as to why it is typically found in older or elderly adults. I know that as we age our cells change and they can mutate or deteriorate. Since this can happen at any age, I am wondering why dementia disorders are less common in children and young adults. I mean, theorectically, a child could develop Alzheimer's disease, could they not?My brother is 40 yrs old and was told that he has brain shrinkage. They say that he has dementia. His conditiona has progressively gotten worse over the past two years. He is usually confused, he doesn't speak with complete sentances, he stutters alot and his comprehension skills are very minimal. The doctors told us that this is somthing that they usually see in 70 yr olds. They say they are not sure why this happened to him. They apologized to us and said that there is nothing that they can do for him. They also said that he won't get better and he should stay away from drugs ans alcohol becaus this will just make him worse.Thanks,ForJayThis discussion is related toBrain shrinkage or Alzheimer's.My mom is an identical twin. Her twin sister just passed away the end of January and had Alzheimers.    My mother has been showing signs of dementia, but we havent been able to get her diagnosed yet.    How high is the probability that me or one of my siblings will have some form of dementia in the future?I am 41 years old and have brain damage and dementia due to an overdose in 2003. I have 2 MRI's over the years .. one just recent. Both show I have 4 white spots and haven't changed over the years but want to keep an eye on them. I was wondering if they are caused by brain damage and dementia.Also, they assume I will develope Alzheimer's, as Dad had it at young age. Would an MRI show Alzheimer's. I live in Canada and that is the only best available technology they can do. I am on maximum aricept now and have short term memory loss still and can no longer calculate.Just wondering if they will ever know besides autopsy if and when I have full blown Alzheimers with MRI.4 months ago, my mother's symptoms of forgetfulness had become so extreme that we scheduled a neurologist appointment for her. She has a family history of severe dementia (technically not Alzheimers). After running MRI's, doing memory tests and running other diagnistic procedures, her neurologist officially diagnised her with \Mild Cognitive Impairment.\ Her neurologist suggested that stress could be a contributing factor, but given her family history she was prescribed Aricept as a preventative measure.During the time of this diagnosis, my father (her husband of 53 years) passed away. This sent her condition into overdrive. She has only vague memories of the funeral.She lived alone for 4 weeks following my father's passing. During this time, we noted a decline in her ability to care for herself. Undoubtedly depression is a contributing factor, but even after her mourning had time to subside, she would not eat properly and began losing weight. Even more discouraging was the fact that she became unable to properly administer her own medicines due to her forgetfulness. Setting out her pills for her, getting her an alarm clock to remind her it was time to take her pills - these had only marginal success. On her own she continued to mis-dose herself - both undertaking and overtaking her medicines.We live 750 miles away, and at over the holidays we came to pick her up for a \visit\. We took her home with us to a room in our home we had specially prepared for her. Surrounding her with familiar photos, pieces of art and even furniture items, we intended for her new home to be with us so that we could fastidiously watch over her care.Now, we have become the bad guys because we refuse to let her go home. She yearns for the home my father built for them, and gives no credence to her mental impairment. We've attempted to give her as much autonomy as possible while explaining that her inherited impairment requires \a little bit of help\ but her reasoning skills have now fallen victim to her MCI, which we fear is progressing to a state of actual dementia. She is already exhibiting many symptoms of mild, and a few symptoms of moderate dementia. The accelleration has been rapid and alarming. Her good moments are very, very good. But in those bad moments, it's very much like trying to reason with a pre-schooler who has not yet developed reasoning skills of their own.Since the onset of this impairment was so rapid, we're questioning ourselves about holding mom here against her will. Could we be wrong? Is there any merit to my mother's tearful pleas of \let me go home, I've got to TRY to make it on my own.\ We fear for her safety, but moreso we fear a rapid accelleration of her condition if she returns to an empty, lonely house full of sad memories of a missing spouse.Our current dilemma is one that is more social than medical. We're hoping to strike a deal with her, and frankly we don't know if this is a good idea or not. Perhaps someone here can offer a bit of advice.Would it be of benefit for us to try to come to an agreement with her? If her neurologist, primary care physician or cardiologist confirms that she needs some assistance in day-to-day living, thus making her disease \the bad guy\ instead of us, would this potentially be well received? Having never dealt with dementia patients, we have no idea whether we're over reacting or if an agreement like this would even resonate with someone in her condition.We're using repetition as one strategy, but we need her to be accepting of her new life and not continue to hold us as the adversary. Any suggestions on making my mother content with her new surroundings would be welcome.My elderly mother has Alzheimer's Disease, she is 87, and recently developed elevated Liver Enzymes. Her geriatrician stopped all her meds including those for Alzheimers to stabilize her liver. Once her Liver stabilized, the doctor introduced Risperdal stating that it is less liver antagonistic.I have read much about Risperdal being fatal to the    elderly but I have also read that given in low doses it is quite effective. My mother is currently in the hospital now for a week, and the Psychiatrist has increased the dose to 2 mg a day. He tells me that this is a low dose but I keep obsessing over the mortality issue. Aside from the Dementia, my mother is in decent health except for COPD, and does not require oxygen.Could someone shed some light on this subject, and the dosage, as it has created much anxiety for me despite her beginning to positively respond.My husband has Picks disease/ frontal dementia and went for a phyical and blood work came back with high colestroal/sp .    He is in moderate phase of the disease 7 1/2 years into it.    He didn't want the medicine so I give him flax oil and cherrios .    What other things should I do?    We both don't want him to take alot of medicine which he is already on Namenda and Aricept which costs us a lot.    He is starting to have swelling of the prostate and will check it next year.    This disease starts in their 40's to 60's and usually    10 to 13 years.    He is 66 year old in sept.    Should we put a lot of money    into drugs and than he will be helpless in a few years/ like alzheimer's.    He already can't write and reading is getting hard.    Still looks normal and can do most of the things he does everyday.    He doesn't want to be on machines or kept alive if there is no quaity of life.My brother had Ramsey-Hunt Syndrome about 1-1/2 years ago. He had damage to his eye, partial face paralysis and hearing loss. It is my understanding that RHS is a form of shingles caused by a virus. About 3 months ago, he started having hallucinations and delirium. The doctors have ruled out kidney infection, brain tumors, Alzheimers, stroke and trauma. He has loss over 100 lbs in the 3 months and has very little appetite. He is cognizant of his hallucinations and admits he cannot distinguish between what is real and what is not real. Is it possible that the virus has affected his brain functions causing some form of dementia?Hi all,I've been on medhelp for quite some time on the wonderful MS support group.But recently we've gotten the shocking news that my mother may have Alzheimers and I am not nearly well educated on this, but feel its progressing so quickly, it may be related more to her diabetes being out of control.    She has lost 40 pounds in the last 6-8 months.    I was with her last week trying to get an emergency geriatric psych eval, but no luck.    Took her to the doctor she has seen for years and even tho the weight loss is akncolwedged, they were more concerned about more tests, then revisiting her meds.     I feel that her taking meds for diabetes, high blood pressure and congential heart failure for someone who was 40 lbs heavier is a huge mistake.She was not monitoring her sugars, nor taking her meds regularly, but once she came back up here with family, we started her on the med regimen as directed / orginally prescribed and started seeing her condition get drastically worse.    She had two episodes of sugars crashing, once to 21 and she was rushed to the hospital (where she remains) and then the following morning at the hospital, it was a 7 (yep that is a single digit).     They have removed her from all meds to let everything clear her system, but her dementia has gone from just forgetting a conversation 5 minutes ago to now seeing kids in the 'backyard' and them trying to break into the sliding screen door.    My brother is out on the front porch (outside her hospital door) talking to neighbors and sounds like kids are fighting int he street (hallway).    Even more terrifying to me, she thought it was 1975 and swore my dead brother had just left from visiting and she spoke to my father earlier (dad died in 1976).     She is also seeing cats everywhere (we recently had to surrender many of her cats, she was turning into the crazy cat lady with a shocking number of 16 in the house).     That was the trigger that made her flee WV with the cats in a van and drive to Baltimore.    We had the cats surrendered to a safe shelter, tho she thinks they got out of her van, doctors say to let her beleive they escaped, no need to confront her with a truth that will only agitate her worse.So, any thoughts....    does such a quick decline sound like anyone's experience with Alzheimer?     I know diabetes has its own mess of dementia and even bouncing around with meds can cause her to have paranoia behavior or see things.     But the doctors are leaning towards alzheimers and I just don't know enough to accept or fight that logic.    I always thought of Alzheimers as being a long slow painful process...    She is perfectly functional at moments, having conversations with me about events of the last week, then in the middle of it, she will start whispering that the boys are outside fussing with the windows again.Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.    I know no one here can say it's definitely this or that...    just looking for input on what experiences people here have had...     and as always on medhelp, looking to vent and know we're not alone dealing with this situation!!!Thank you for reading!!JenI'm a 33 year old male, and over the last few months I have been experiecing short and even a little long term memory loss, some confusion on getting common words mixed up or forgetting them, or calling my friends the wrong name sometimes and basically not feeling like myself. I'm not depressed though, I'm eating and exercising healthy and I am very social but I'm worried that I'm experiencing in early form of Alzheimer's. My Mother has been diagnosed with Dementia in the past year as well. Any advice?My wife has been diagnosed to be at the early stage of Alzheimers or Dementia. She is on medication (Arizept and many other suggested vitamins).She is loosing weight rapidly, has no interest in things (except great Granchildren).She sleeps during the night and most of the day if I do not take her for a ride. She refuses to walk with me,and do the usual things we used to do together.(She will do laundy almost daily however.)My question is:How can I stimulate her inerest to become mentally more active? She was been given several books to read, but does not seem to be interested in reading other than the daily flyes and ads. Her excuse is her macular degeneration (One eye).I am desperately trying to help her, but do not know how to approach the probles as she seems to resent suggestions I make based on literature I read on the subject.Thank you.I found out today that my dad has been experiencing severe memory loss, and it came on suddenly. He has lived in the same small town forever, and got lost twice in the last week. He's 68 and retired. He has suffered from severe headaches pretty much his whole life. Recently been complaining about severe neck pain, but the memory loss is very new. He was a hard labourer his whole life and has smoked since he was a teenager. Some insomnia and restless leg as well.He's a stubborn old-timer so for him to bring it to our attention is a big deal, but now he's brushing it off and wants to go see a few massage therapists to take care of his neck, because that's what he believes the cause is. Trying really hard to convince him to get it checked out, as I am fearing Alzheimers or brain tumour.My question is, does this sound like Alzheimers? I want to have as much info to give him to convince him to go the doctor!    Did some reading, there seems to be common symptoms among alzheimers, dementia, brain tumour.Trying really hard not to freak out, would just really like to have an informed opinion not just jump to conclusions.Can dementia occur in younger men, say 44-45 years of age? At least to some degree? I've suffered two CVA's and my family would agree that I display a fair number of the symptoms listed under Dementia. (Alzheimer's also runs in my family - on my mother's side, for whatever that is worth),Atrophy is noted with prominence of the sulci, sylvian fissures and ventricles along with periventricular and centrum semiovale areas of high signal intensity from chronic deep white matter ischemic changes. There are no masses, mass effects or midline shifts.Diffusion-weighted images show no evidence of areas of restricted diffusion.Can you explain what this means??Is this a form of dementia or Alzheimers???Thank YouMother had been experiencing dreams, nightmares really centering on the things she fears the most - abandoment, loss of control of her money, being pushed down the stairs, etc.    These dreams were very real to her and she would then argue with her husband about why he said he wanted to do these things to her.    He, of course, knew nothing of these \conversations and situations\ she thought were so real.    Additionally, when she focused on a subject she could not let it go until someone helped her make sense of it.    Often she has had angry outbursts over the past few years also, has been afraid of descending stairways, falling, and dark places.    Mother is in her late 90s now, but this has been going on for over 10 years.Recently she went to see a neurologist who took a blood test and ordered a brain scan.    THis doctor told her that her brain is shrinking and that she does not have Alzheimer's disease.    However, he prescribed Aricept for her to take.    It wasn't calming her down any, and she did not refil the prescription.    2 months later she had another bad dream and the doctor was notified.    He then prescribed exelon.My question:    If she does not have Alzheimer's disease, why would he prescribe either of these medicines for her?    If this is dimentia(dementia), aren't there other drugs out there for that or even drugs that have a claming effect?    From what I have read about excelon, I am not sure if it is compatible with her heart medication.A second question:    She also takes coumadin to thin her blood, and I have read that excelon could cause bleeding.    Could there be a drug interaction between these two drugs that may cause internal bleeding to occur?Thank you for your time.please go read my story on what happen to our mom , who had alzheimer and given haldol.posted on haldol and post operative dementia. momvoice4My wife was recently prescribed both Aricept and Namenda.    Does that mean she has Alzheimer's or do they prescribe those medicines for other kinds of dementia too?    She's not demented at all, however, and her memory continues to be good.    She is eighty years old and now and then she forgets a doctor's appointment, but since she has six doctors that might be expected.    I haven't had a one-on-one with her neurologist, though.    She has to sign a HIPAA waiver first.My father is 51 years old and I am moving to be with him.    I am 23 years old and am unsure what to expect.    My father will not share any information but just wants me there.    From what I gather from my sister he has dementia caused by mini strokes he has been having for most of his life unnoticed.    I can't seem to find any information on this disease without it being linked with Alzheimers.    He does not have that so I don't know what to expect.    I have some experience with working with autistic behavioral children and caring for adults with polio but am unsure what to look foward to. Can someone please help me... either by answering these questions or sending me a link that can give me more detailed information. Also I hear that people that young live with dementia, not die from it so how bad is it going to get?    My father is healthy all around other than this. Please help anyone who canMy father ( 80yrs with Alzheimer's/mild Parkinson's symptoms)    has been a relatively \low\ does of the risperdal for some time now.     The nursing staff claim that it keeps him from being agitated.     It however, leaves him in a catatonic state.     He cannot speak and he sits and nods off with his pupils like pinholes.     They claim this is for his \safety\    and that of the nursing staff.    I find this hard to believe because he is confined to a wheelchair    and cannot stand on his own.    He is a relatively weak person,    his muscles atrophied several years ago.    I have requested the doctor refrain from this chemical lobotomy but am being met with resistance.    I know that current research suggests that risperdal is infact harmful to use with dementia patients.    Has anyone had a similar experience?     I would prefer to be able to talk with my father in his final years (even if he doesn't recognize me) rather than look at someone who resembles Nicholson in the final scene of Cuckoo's nest.     Any comments would be greatly appreciated.    --J.findings of small vessel disease, what is that.does one needs to take medicine.what can i do to pervent to have dementiaThis discussion is related topreventing Alzheimer's.Is it the case that all cases of so called early onset Alzheimers Disease (diagnosis late 50s/under the age of 65) are considered genetic or is it possible that for this particular person it could have just been a \fluke/bad luck/sporadic\ for that person?Given the fact that the not one of the siblings, (all aged over 70 and one sister aged 82) plus also all of their children some aged into their late 50s have no symptoms of Alzheimers or dementia    what do you think, based on your medical and scientific experience could have caused this, (could this have be a sporadic case) plus what do you think are the implications for this persons children? Is there an increase risk for them?Thanks for your help.
